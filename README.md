### Project Deliverables
> - <b> google slides that: </b>

    - summarize results from exploration and modeling
    - visuals that help describe our findings
    
> - <b> a github repository containing: </b>

    - final notebook containing steps, analysis and findings
    - a README.md that contains description and steps to reproduce
    - README.md should also contin hyperlink to google slides
    
> - <b> a 5-6 minute presentation of findings </b>
    
### Initial questions on the data

>  - Questions
>  - Thoughts
>  - etc

### Project Plan 

- [ ] **Acquire** Web scrapping of Github search results. The first 500 repos with the keyword of 'games' on the search date of July 22, 2022 were used.
- [ ] Clean and **prepare** data for the explore phase. 
- [ ] Create wrangle.py to store functions I created to automate the cleaning and preparation process. 
- [ ] Separate train, validate, test subsets and scaled data.
- [ ] **Explore** the data through visualization and hypothesis testing.
    - [ ] Clearly define at hypotheses and questions.
    - [ ] Document findings and takeaways.
- [ ] Perform **modeling**:
   - [ ] Identify model evaluation criteria
   - [ ] Create at least three different models.
   - [ ] Evaluate models on appropriate data subsets.
- [ ] Create **Final Report** notebook with a curtailed version of the above steps.
- [ ] Create and review README. Ensure it contaions:
   - [ ] Data dictionary
   - [ ] Project summary and goals
   - [ ] Initial Hypothesis
   - [ ] Executive Summary
