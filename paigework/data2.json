  "readme_contents": "### What are we doing?\n\nWe\u2019re updating the first million selling computer book, [BASIC Computer Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Computer_Games), for 2022 and beyond!\n\n- [Read the original book](https://annarchive.com/files/Basic_Computer_Games_Microcomputer_Edition.pdf) (pdf)\n- [Play the original games in your browser](https://troypress.com/wp-content/uploads/user/js-basic/index.html)\n\n### Where can we discuss it?\n\nPlease see [the discussion here](https://discourse.codinghorror.com/t/-/7927) for a worklog and conversation around this project.\n\n### Project structure\n\nI have moved all [the original BASIC source code](http://www.vintage-basic.net/games.html) into a folder for each project in the original book (first volume). Note that Lyle Kopnicky has generously normalized all the code (thanks Lyle!) to run against [Vintage Basic](http://www.vintage-basic.net/download.html) circa 2009:\n\n> I\u2019ve included all the games here for your tinkering pleasure. I\u2019ve tested and tweaked each one of them to make sure they\u2019ll run with Vintage BASIC, though you may see a few oddities. That\u2019s part of the fun of playing with BASIC: it never works quite the same on two machines. The games will play better if you keep CAPS LOCK on, as they were designed to be used with capital-letter input.\n\nEach project has subfolders corresponding to the languages we\u2019d like to see the games ported to. This is based on the [2022 TIOBE index of top languages](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) that are _**memory safe**_ and _**general purpose scripting languages**_ per [this post](https://discourse.codinghorror.com/t/-/7927/34):\n\n1. C# \n2. Java\n3. JavaScript\n4. Kotlin\n5. Lua\n6. Perl\n7. Python\n8. Ruby\n9. Rust\n10. VB.NET\n\n> \ud83d\udce2 Note that in March 2022 we removed Pascal / Object Pascal and replaced it with Rust as we couldn\u2019t determine if Pascal is effectively memory safe. We\u2019ve also added Lua, as it made the top 20 in TIOBE (as of 2022) and it is both memory safe and a scripting language. The Pascal ports were moved to the alternate languages folder.\n\n> \u26a0\ufe0f Please note that we have decided, as a project, that we **do not want any IDE-specific or build-specific files in the repository.** Please refrain from committing any files to the repository that only exist to work with a specific IDE or a specific build system.\n\n### Alternate Languages\n\nIf you wish to port one of the programs to a language not in our list \u2013 that is, a language which is either not memory safe, or not a general purpose scripting language, you can do so via the `00_Alternate_Languages` folder. Place your port in the appropriate game subfolder, in a subfolder named for the language. Please note that these ports are appreciated, but they will not count toward the donation total at the end of the project.\n\n### Project goals\n\nFeel free to begin converting these classic games into the above list of modern, memory safe languages. In fact, courtesy of @mojoaxel, you can even view the JavaScript versions in your web browser at\n\nhttps://coding-horror.github.io/basic-computer-games/\n\nBut first, a few guidelines:\n\n- **These are very old games**. They date from the mid-70s so they\u2019re not exactly examples of what kids (or anyone, really?) would be playing these days. Consider them more like classic programming exercises to teach programming.  We\u2019re paying it forward by converting them into modern languages, so the next generation can learn from the programs in this classic book \u2013 and compare implementations across common modern languages.\n\n- **Stay true to the original program**. These are mostly unsophisticated, simple command line / console games, so we should strive to replicate the command line / console output and behavior illustrated in the original book. See the README in the project folder for links to the original scanned source input and output. Try [running the game in your browser](https://troypress.com/wp-content/uploads/user/js-basic/index.html). Avoid the impulse to add features; keep it simple, _except_ for modern conventions, see next item \ud83d\udc47\n\n- **Please DO update for modern coding conventions**. Support uppercase and lowercase. Use structured programming. Use subroutines. Try to be an example of good, modern coding practices!\n\n- **Use lots of comments to explain what is going on**. Comment liberally! If there were clever tricks in the original code, decompose those tricks into simpler (even if more verbose) code, and use comments to explain what\u2019s happening and why. If there is something particularly tricky about a program, edit the **Porting Notes** section of the `readme.md` to let everyone know. Those `GOTO`s can be very pesky..\n\n- **Please don\u2019t get _too_ fancy**. Definitely use the most recent versions and features of the target language, but also try to keep the code samples simple and explainable \u2013 the goal is to teach programming in the target language, not necessarily demonstrate the cleverest one-line tricks, or big system \"enterprise\" coding techniques designed for thousands of lines of code.\n\n- **Please don't check in any build specific or IDE specific files**. We want the repository to be simple and clean, so we have ruled out including any IDE or build system specific files from the repository. Git related files are OK, as we are using Git and this is GitHub. \ud83d\ude09\n\n### Emulation and Bugfixes\n\nWe want the general behavior of the original programs to be preserved, _however_, we also want to update them, specifically:\n\n- allow both UPPERCASE and lowercase input and display\n- incorporate any bugfixes to the original programs; see the `readme.md` in the game folder\n- improved error handling for bad or erroneous input\n\nPlease note that on the back of the Basic Computer Games book it says **Microsoft 8K Basic, Rev 4.0 was the version David Ahl used to test**, so that is the level of compatibility we are looking for. \u00a0QBasic on the DOS emulation is a\u00a0later version of Basic but one that retains downwards compatibility so far in our testing. To verify behavior, try [running the programs in your browser](https://troypress.com/wp-content/uploads/user/js-basic/index.html) with [JS BASIC, effectively Applesoft BASIC](https://github.com/inexorabletash/jsbasic/).\n\n### Have fun!\n\nThank you for taking part in this project to update a classic programming book \u2013 one of the most influential programming books in computing history \u2013 for 2022 and beyond!\n\nNOTE: per [the official blog post announcement](https://blog.codinghorror.com/updating-the-single-most-influential-book-of-the-basic-era/), I will be **donating $5 for each contributed program in the 10 agreed upon languages to [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/)**.\n"

  "readme_contents": "Free Python Games\n=================\n\n`Free Python Games`_ is an Apache2 licensed collection of free Python games\nintended for education and fun. The games are written in simple Python code and\ndesigned for experimentation and changes. Simplified versions of several\nclassic arcade games are included.\n\nPython is one of the top-five most popular programming languages in the world\nand available for free from `Python.org <https://www.python.org/>`_. Python\nincludes an extensive Standard Library distributed with your installation. The\nStandard Library has a module called Turtle which is a popular way to introduce\nprogramming to kids. Turtle was part of the original Logo programming language\ndeveloped by Wally Feurzig and Seymour Papert in 1966. All of the games in\n`Free Python Games`_ are implemented using Python and its Turtle module.\n\nStarting in 2012, `Free Python Games`_ began as an after school program to\nteach programming to inner-city youth. The goal was to have fun as much as it\nwas to learn. Since then the games have been improved and used in a variety of\nsettings ranging from classrooms to summer day-camps.\n\nThe games run anywhere Python can be installed which includes desktop computers\nrunning Windows, Mac OS, or Linux and older or low-power hardware such as the\nRaspberry Pi. Kids across the United States in grades 6th-12th have enjoyed\nlearning about topics such as encryption and projectile motion through games.\n\nEach game is entirely independent from the others and includes comments along\nwith a list of exercises to work through with students. Creativity and\nflexibility is important. There is no right or wrong way to implement a new\nfeature or behavior! You never know which games students will engage with best.\n\n.. _`Free Python Games`: http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/freegames/\n\n\nTestimonials\n------------\n\n*\"I love Free Python Games because the games are fun and they're easy to\nunderstand and change. I like making my own games now.\"*\n\n-- Luke Martin, Student\n\n*\"Free Python Games inspired and introduced a new hobby to our son. Thank you so\nmuch for exposing him to coding. He is having so much fun!\"*\n\n-- Mary Lai, Parent\n\n*\"Free Python Games are great because they really engage students and let them\nlearn at their own pace.\"*\n\n-- Rick Schertle, Teacher, Steindorf STEAM School\n\n*\"Free Python Games combines play and learning in a flexible environment that\nreduces the stress of a difficult topic like programming.\"*\n\n-- Brett Bymaster, Youth Pastor, The River Church Community\n\n*\"Free Python Games is great for students, is highly organized and flexible,\nand seeks to unleash inquiry and understanding.\"*\n\n-- Terri Furton, Principal, Downtown College Prep\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Fun to play!\n- Simple Python code\n- Easy to install\n- Designed for education\n- Depends only on the Python Standard Library\n- Used in hundreds of hours of classroom instruction\n- Fully Documented\n- 100% Test Coverage\n- Developed on Python 3.10\n- Tested on CPython 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10\n- Tested on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows\n- Tested using GitHub Actions\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/grantjenks/free-python-games/workflows/integration/badge.svg\n   :target: http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/freegames/\n\n\nQuickstart\n----------\n\nInstalling Free Python Games is simple with `pip\n<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_::\n\n  $ python3 -m pip install freegames\n\nFree Python Games supports a command-line interface (CLI). Help for the CLI is\navailable using::\n\n  $ python3 -m freegames --help\n\nThe CLI supports three commands: list, copy, and show. For a list of all games\nrun::\n\n  $ python3 -m freegames list\n\nAny of the listed games may be played by executing the Python module from the\ncommand-line. To reference the Python module, combine \"freegames\" with the name\nof the game. For example, to play the \"snake\" game run::\n\n  $ python3 -m freegames.snake\n\nGames can be modified by copying their source code. The copy command will\ncreate a Python file in your local directory which you can edit. For example,\nto copy and play the \"snake\" game run::\n\n  $ python3 -m freegames copy snake\n  $ python3 snake.py\n\nPython includes a built-in text editor named IDLE which can also execute Python\ncode. To launch the editor and make changes to the \"snake\" game run::\n\n  $ python3 -m idlelib.idle snake.py\n\nYou can also access documentation in the interpreter with Python's built-in\nhelp function::\n\n  >>> import freegames\n  >>> help(freegames)\n\n\nFree Games\n----------\n\nPaint\n.....\n\n`Paint`_ -- draw lines and shapes on the screen.

  "readme_contents": "\nRecast & Detour\n===============\n\n[![Travis (Linux) Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/recastnavigation/recastnavigation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/recastnavigation/recastnavigation)\n[![Appveyor (Windows) Build  Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/20w84u25b3f8h179/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/recastnavigation/recastnavigation/branch/master)\n\n![screenshot of a navmesh baked with the sample program](/RecastDemo/screenshot.png?raw=true)\n\n## Recast\n\nRecast is state of the art navigation mesh construction toolset for games.\n\n* It is automatic, which means that you can throw any level geometry at it and you will get robust mesh out\n* It is fast which means swift turnaround times for level designers\n* It is open source so it comes with full source and you can customize it to your heart's content. \n\nThe Recast process starts with constructing a voxel mold from a level geometry \nand then casting a navigation mesh over it. The process consists of three steps, \nbuilding the voxel mold, partitioning the mold into simple regions, peeling off \nthe regions as simple polygons.\n\n1. The voxel mold is built from the input triangle mesh by rasterizing the triangles into a multi-layer heightfield. Some simple filters are  then applied to the mold to prune out locations where the character would not be able to move.\n2. The walkable areas described by the mold are divided into simple overlayed 2D regions. The resulting regions have only one non-overlapping contour, which simplifies the final step of the process tremendously.\n3. The navigation polygons are peeled off from the regions by first tracing the boundaries and then simplifying them. The resulting polygons are finally converted to convex polygons which makes them perfect for pathfinding and spatial reasoning about the level. \n\n\n## Detour\n\nRecast is accompanied with Detour, path-finding and spatial reasoning toolkit. You can use any navigation mesh with Detour, but of course the data generated with Recast fits perfectly.\n\nDetour offers simple static navigation mesh which is suitable for many simple cases, as well as tiled navigation mesh which allows you to plug in and out pieces of the mesh. The tiled mesh allows you to create systems where you stream new navigation data in and out as the player progresses the level, or you may regenerate tiles as the world changes. \n\n\n## Recast Demo\n\nYou can find a comprehensive demo project in RecastDemo folder. It is a kitchen sink demo containing all the functionality of the library. If you are new to Recast & Detour, check out [Sample_SoloMesh.cpp](/RecastDemo/Source/Sample_SoloMesh.cpp) to get started with building navmeshes and [NavMeshTesterTool.cpp](/RecastDemo/Source/NavMeshTesterTool.cpp) to see how Detour can be used to find paths.\n\n### Building RecastDemo\n\nRecastDemo uses [premake5](http://premake.github.io/) to build platform specific projects. Download it and make sure it's available on your path, or specify the path to it.\n\n#### Linux\n\n- Install SDL2 and its dependencies according to your distro's guidelines.\n- run `premake5 gmake` from the `RecastDemo` folder.\n- `cd Build/gmake` then `make`\n- `cd RecastDemo/Bin` and then run `./RecastDemo`\n\n#### OSX\n\n- Grab the latest SDL2 development library dmg from [here](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) and place `SDL2.framework` in `/Library/Frameworks/`\n- Navigate to the `RecastDemo` folder and run `premake5 xcode4`\n- Open `Build/xcode4/recastnavigation.xcworkspace`\n- Select the \"RecastDemo\" project in the left pane, go to the \"BuildPhases\" tab and expand \"Link Binary With Libraries\"\n- Remove the existing entry for SDL2 (it should have a white box icon) and re-add it by hitting the plus, selecting \"Add Other\", and selecting `/Library/Frameworks/SDL2.framework`.  It should now have a suitcase icon.\n- Set the RecastDemo project as the target and build.\n\n#### Windows\n\n- Grab the latest SDL2 development library release from [here](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) and unzip it `RecastDemo\\Contrib`.  Rename the SDL folder such that the path `RecastDemo\\Contrib\\SDL\\lib\\x86` is valid.\n- Run `\"premake5\" vs2019` from the `RecastDemo` folder\n- Open the solution, build, and run.\n\n### Running Unit tests\n\n- Follow the instructions to build RecastDemo above.  Premake should generate another build target called \"Tests\".\n- Build the \"Tests\" project.  This will generate an executable named \"Tests\" in `RecastDemo/Bin/`\n- Run the \"Tests\" executable.  It will execute all the unit tests, indicate those that failed, and display a count of those that succeeded.\n\n## Integrating with your own project\n\nIt is recommended to add the source directories `DebugUtils`, `Detour`, `DetourCrowd`, `DetourTileCache`, and `Recast` into your own project depending on which parts of the project you need. For example your level building tool could include `DebugUtils`, `Recast`, and `Detour`, and your game runtime could just include `Detour`.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee the [Contributing document](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines for making contributions.\n\n## Discuss\n\n- Discuss Recast & Detour: http://groups.google.com/group/recastnavigation\n- Development blog: http://digestingduck.blogspot.com/\n\n## License\n\nRecast & Detour is licensed under ZLib license, see License.txt for more information.\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Google Play Games plugin for Unity\n_Copyright (c) 2014 Google Inc. All rights reserved._\n\nThe Google Play Games plugin for Unity&reg; is an open-source project whose goal\nis to provide a plugin that allows game developers to integrate with\nthe Google Play Games API from a game written in Unity&reg;. However, this project is\nnot in any way endorsed or supervised by Unity Technologies.\n\n_Unity&reg; is a trademark of Unity Technologies._\n\n_iOS is a trademark of Apple, Inc._\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Google Play Games plugin for Unity allows you to access the Google Play Games\nAPI through Unity's [social interface](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Social.html).\nThe plugin provides support for the\nfollowing features of the Google Play Games API:<br/>\n\n* sign in\n* friends\n* unlock/reveal/increment achievement\n* post score to leaderboard\n* cloud save read/write\n* show built-in achievement/leaderboards UI\n* events\n* [nearby connections](NEARBY.md)\n\n__NOTICE__: This version of the plugin no longer supports iOS.  Google Play games services for iOS is deprecated,\nand is not likely to function as expected. Do not use Google Play games\nservices for iOS in new apps. See the [deprecation announcement](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/04/focusing-our-google-play-games-services.html) blog post for more details.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* easy GUI-oriented project setup (integrated into the Unity GUI)\n* no need to override/customize the player Activity\n* no need to override/customize AndroidManifest.xml\n\nSystem requirements:\n\n* Unity&reg; 2017.4 or above.\n\n* To deploy on Android:\n    * Android SDK\n    * Android v4.0 or higher\n    * Google Play Services library, version 11.6 or above\n\n## Upgrading\n\nIf you have already integrated your project with a previous version of the\nplugin and wish to upgrade to a new version, please refer to the\n[upgrade instructions](UPGRADING.txt).\n\n## Configure Your Game\n\nTo use the plugin, you must first [configure your\ngame](https://developers.google.com/games/services/console/enabling) in the\nGoogle Play Developer Console. Follow the instructions on creating a client ID.\nBe particularly careful when entering your package name and your\ncertificate fingerprints, since mistakes on those screens can be difficult to\nrecover from.\n\n### Copy the game resources from the console\n\nOnce you configure at least one resource (event, achievement, or leaderboard),\ncopy the resource configuration from the Google Play Developer Console, and paste it\ninto the setup configuration in Unity.  To get the resources go to the Achievements\ntab, then click on \"Get resources\" on the bottom of the list.\n\n![click Get Resources](docgen/resourcesLink.png \"Show the resources data\")\n\nThen click the \"Android section\".\n\n![Android Resources](docgen/resources.png \"Android resource data\")\n\nSelect all the contents of the resources window, and copy them to the clipboard.\n\n### Paste the game resources into the plugin setup dialog\n\nBack in Unity, open the setup dialog **Window > Google Play Games > Setup... > Android Setup**\n\n![Android Setup](docgen/AndroidSetup.png \"Android setup\")\n\n * **Enter the directory to save constants** - Enter the folder for the constants file.\n * **Constants class name** - this is the name of the C# class to create, including namespace.\n * **Resources Definition** - paste the resource data from the Play Games console here.\n * **Web client ID** - this is the client ID of the linked web app.  It is only needed if\nyou have a web-based backend for your game and need a server auth code to be\nexchanged for an access token by the backend server, or if you need an id token\nfor the player to make other, non-game, API calls.\n\nThe setup process will configure your game with the client id and generate a\nC# class that contains constants for each of your resources.\n\n## Setup Checklist\n\nMake sure to do the following if they are relevant to your game:\n\n1. Add tester email addresses to the testing section of your game on the Play Games Console.\n2. The SHA1 fingerprint used to create the linked Android app is from the keystore\nused to sign the Unity application.\n\n## Add Achievements and Leaderboards\n\nAdd\n[achievements](https://developers.google.com/games/services/common/concepts/achievements)\nand\n[leaderboards](https://developers.google.com/games/services/common/concepts/leaderboards)\nto your game in the Google Play Developer Console. For each achievement and\nleaderboard you configure, make sure to note\nthe corresponding **achievement ID** or **leaderboard ID**,\nas those will be needed when making the API calls.\nAchievement and leaderboard IDs are alphanumeric strings (e.g.  \"Cgkx9eiuwi8_AQ\").\n\n## Add Events\n\nEvents allow you to track user actions in your game and report on them with\nAnalytics.\nRead more about how to configure and use Events on\n[Game Concepts - Events](https://developers.google.com/games/services/common/concepts/events)\n\n## Load Your Game Project\n\nNext, load your game project into the Unity editor.\n\nIf you do not have a game project to work with, you can use the **Minimal** sample\navailable in the **samples** directory. Using that sample will allow you to\nquickly test your setup and make sure you can access the API.\n\nIf you want to test a larger sample after you are familiar with the plugin,\ntry the **CubicPilot** game.\nMore information about building the samples can be found in the\n[samples README](samples/README.md) file.\n\n## Plugin Installation\n\nTo download the plugin, clone this Git repository into your file system (or download it as\na ZIP file and unpack it). Then, look for the **unitypackage** file in\nthe **current-build** directory:\n\n    current-build/GooglePlayGamesPluginForUnity-X.YY.ZZ.unitypackage\n\nTo install the plugin, simply open your game project in Unity and import that file into\nyour project's assets, as you would any other Unity package. This is accomplished through\nthe **Assets > Import Package > Custom Package** menu item (you can also reach this menu it\nby right-clicking the **Assets** folder).\n\nNext, make sure your current build platform is set to **Android**. From\n**File > Build Settings\u2026** select **Android** and click **Switch Platform**.\nYou should now see a new menu item was added under **Window > Google Play Games**.\nIf you don't see the new menu items, refresh the assets by\nclicking **Assets > Refresh** and try again.\n\n## Android Setup\n\nNext, set up the path to your Android SDK installation in Unity. This is located in the\npreferences menu, under the **External Tools** section.\n\nTo configure your Unity game to run with Google Play Games on Android, first\nopen the Android SDK manager and verify that you have downloaded the following\npackages.  Depending on if you are using the SDK manager from Android Studio,\nor using the standalone SDK manager, the name of the components may be different.\n- Google Play Services\n- Android Support Library\n- Local Maven repository for Support Libraries (Also known as Android Support Repository)\n- Google Repository\n- Android 6.0 (API 23) (this does not affect the min SDK version).\n\nNext, configure your game's package name. To do this, click **File > Build Settings**,\nselect the **Android** platform and click **Player Settings** to show Unity's\nPlayer Settings window. In that window, look for the **Bundle Identifier** setting\nunder **Other Settings**. Enter your package name there (for example\n_com.example.my.awesome.game_).\n\nIn order to sign in to Play Game Services, you need to sign your APK file,\nmake sure that you are signing it with the\ncorrect certificate, that is, the one that corresponds to the SHA1 certificate\nfingerprint you entered in the Developer Console during the setup.\n\nNext, click the **Window |Google Play Games|Setup - Android setup** menu item.\nThis will display the Android setup screen.\n\nEnter the Constants class name.  This is the name of the fully qualified class\nthat will be updated (or created) which contains the IDs of the game resources.\nThe format of the name is <namespace>.<classname>.  For example, `AwesomeGame.GPGSIds`\n\nPaste the resource definition data.  This is the XML data from the Google Play Developer Console\nwhich contains the resource IDs as well as the Application ID for Android.\n\nThis data is found in the Google Play Developer Console by clicking \"Get resources\" on any of the\nresource pages (e.g. Achievements or Leaderboards), then clicking Android.\n\nAfter pasting the data into the text area, click the **Setup** button.\n\n**Note:**  If you are using a web application or backend server with your game,\nyou can link the web application to the game to enable getting the player's\nid token and/or email address.  To do this, link a web application to the\ngame in the Google Play Developer Console, and enter the client id for\nthe web application into the setup dialog.\n\n### Additional instructions on building for Android on Windows\n\nIf you are using Windows, you must make sure that your Java SDK installation\ncan be accessed by Unity. To do this:\n\n1. Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to your Java SDK installation path\n(for example, `C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_45`).\n2. Add the Java SDK's `bin` folder to your `PATH` environment variable\n(for example, `C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_45\\bin`)\n3. Reboot.\n\n**How to edit environment variables:** In Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7,\nright-click **My Computer**, then **Properties**, then go to **Advanced System Properties**\n(or **System Properties** and then click the **Advanced** tab), then\nclick **Environment Variables**. On Windows 8, press **Windows Key + W** and\nsearch for **environment variables**\nFor more information, consult the documentation for your version of Windows.\n\n## Run the Project\n\nIf you are working with the **Smoketest** sample, you should be able to build\nand run the project at this point. You will see the automatic sign-in attempt,\nwhen **Smoketest** starts.\n\nTo build and run on Android, click\n**File > Build Settings**, select the **Android** platform, then\n**Switch to Platform**, then **Build and Run**.\n\n## ISocialPlatform Compliance\n\nThe Google Play Games plugin implements  Unity's\n[social interface](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Social.html),\nfor compatibility with games that already use that interface when integrating with other\nplatforms. However, some features are unique to Play Games and are\noffered as extensions to the standard social interface provided by Unity.\n\nThe standard API calls can be accessed through the **Social.Active** object,\nwhich is a reference to an **ISocialPlatform** interface. The non-standard\nGoogle Play Games extensions can be accessed by casting the **Social.Active**\nobject to the **PlayGamesPlatform** class, where the additional methods are\navailable.\n\n## Nearby Connections Configuration\nIn order to use nearby connections, a service id which uniquely identifies the\nset of applications that can interact needs to be configured.\nThis is done by clicking the **Window > Google Play Games > Nearby Connections setup...**\nmenu item. This will display the\nnearby connections setup screen.  On this screen enter the service ID you want to use.\nIt should be something that identifies your application, and  follows the\nsame rules as the bundle id (for example: com.example.myawesomegame.nearby).\nOnce you enter the id, press **Setup**.\n\nTo use nearby connections, the player does not need to be authenticated,\nand no Google Play Developer Console configuration is needed.\n\nFor detailed information on nearby connection usage,\nplease refer to [nearby connections](NEARBY.md).\n\n## Sign in\n\nA connection to Game services will be automatically formed when your game is opened.\nOnce the connection is successful the player will be welcomed with a pop-up and\nyour game is ready to begin using the Games Unity Plugin.\n\nNote: If a user has never used Google Play Games on this device, they will be\nautomatically taken through one-time setup operations such as creating a profile\nwith the Play Games app.\n\nIn the Start method of your script, listen to the result of the automatic sign-in\nattempt, fetch the authentication status and disable Play Games Services features\nif the user is not signed in.\n\n```csharp\n    using GooglePlayGames;\n\n    public void Start() {\n      PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.Authenticate(ProcessAuthentication);\n    }\n\n    internal void ProcessAuthentication(SignInStatus status) {\n      if (status == SignInStatus.Success) {\n        // Continue with Play Games Services\n      } else {\n        // Disable your integration with Play Games Services or show a login button\n        // to ask users to sign-in. Clicking it should call\n        // PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.ManuallyAuthenticate(ProcessAuthentication).\n      }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe result code is an enum, which gives you different failure reasons that will\nhelp you understand sign-in failures better.\n\nIf you prefer using Unity\u2019s Social platform, then you can alternatively use the\ncode block below.\n\n```csharp\n  using GooglePlayGames;\n\n  public void Start() {\n    PlayGamesPlatform.Activate();\n    Social.localUser.Authenticate(ProcessAuthentication);\n  }\n```\n\nNote that you cannot make any games API calls (unlock achievements, post scores,\netc) until you get a successful return value from **Authenticate**, so it is\ngood practice to put up a standby screen until the callback is called, to make\nsure the user can't start playing the game until the authentication process\ncompletes.\n\n## Friends\n\nPlay Games Friends allows players to create and maintain a cross-games friends list. You can request access to this friends list to help your players play your game with their friends. See the [Friends concept page](https://developers.google.com/games/services/common/concepts/friends) for more details on the friends system.\n\nTo enable Friends, use the following functions:\n\n*  [View friends](https://github.com/playgameservices/play-games-plugin-for-unity#view-friends): Request access to a player\u2019s friends list, so you can add their play games friends to your in-game friends list\n*  [View a player profile](https://github.com/playgameservices/play-games-plugin-for-unity#view-a-player-profile): Let a player view the Play Games profile of another player. This is essential so a player knows who their friends are, and can connect to other Play Games players in your game. This will need to be tied to a UI element to trigger the popup. See the [friends guidelines](https://developers.google.com/games/services/checklist#friends) for details.\n\nSee the [best practices guidelines](https://developers.google.com/games/services/checklist#friends) for instructions on how best to implement these APIs.\n\nNote: To use Friends, you need to update your PGS SDK to version 20.0.0\n\n\n### View friends\n\nThere are two ways to load friends, either using the `ISocial` framework or directly with `PlayGamesPlatform`.\n\n#### Loading friends with the ISocial framework\n\n```csharp\nSocial.localUser.LoadFriends((success) =>  {\n    Debug.Log(\"Friends loaded OK: \" + ok));\n    foreach(IUserProfile p in Social.localUser.friends) {\n         Debug.Log(p.userName + \" is a friend\");\n    }\n```\n\nHowever, this call will fail if the current player has not yet granted permission to the game to access this information. Use `GetLastLoadFriendsStatus` to check if `LoadFriends` failed due to missing consent.\n\n```csharp\n PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.GetLastLoadFriendsStatus((status) => {\n    // Check for consent\n    if (status == LoadFriendsStatus.ResolutionRequired) {\n        // Ask for resolution.\n    }\n});\n```\n\nA game can ask the current player to share the friends list by calling `AskForLoadFriendsResolution`.\n\n```csharp\nPlayGamesPlatform.Instance.AskForLoadFriendsResolution((result) => {\n    if (result == UIStatus.Valid) {\n        // User agreed to share friends with the game. Reload friends.\n    } else {\n        // User doesn\u2019t agree to share the friends list.\n    }\n});\n```\n\nThis function will show the appropriate platform-specific friends sharing UI. This UI asks the player if they want to share their friends with the game.\n\n#### Loading friends with PlayGamesPlatform\n\nAnother way of loading friends is to use `LoadFriends` and `LoadMoreFriends`:\n\n```csharp\nPlayGamesPlatform.Instance.LoadFriends(pageSize, forceReload, (status) => {\n    // Check if the call is successful and if there are more friends to load.\n});\n\nPlayGamesPlatform.Instance.LoadMoreFriends(pageSize, (status) => {\n    // Check if there are more friends to load.\n});\n```\n\nThe `pageSize` param represents the number of entries to request for this page. Note that if cached data already exists, the returned buffer may contain more than this size. The buffer is guaranteed to contain at least this many entries if the collection contains enough records. If `forceReload` is set to `true`, this call will clear any locally-cached data and attempt to fetch the latest data from the server. This would commonly be used for actions like a user-initiated refresh. Normally, this should be set to `false` to gain the advantages of data caching.\n\nIf the callback returns `LoadFriendsStatus.LoadMore`, then there are more friends to load. `LoadFriendsStatus.ResolutionRequired` signals that the user has not shared the friends list and you can directly call `PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.AskForLoadFriendsResolution`.\n\n#### Determining friends list visibility\n\nUse `PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.GetFriendsListVisibility` to check if the user has shared the friends list with the game. Possible return statuses are:\n\n   * `FriendsListVisibilityStatus.RequestRequired` indicates you must ask for consent. \n   * `FriendsListVisibilityStatus.Visible` indicates that loading the friends list should succeed.\n   * `FriendsListVisibilityStatus.Unknown` generally shouldn't happen. You can set `forceReload` to true to refresh the data.\n\n```csharp\nPlayGamesPlatform.Instance.GetFriendsListVisibility(forceReload, (friendsListVisibilityStatus) => {});\n```\n\n### View a player profile\n\nTo add or remove a player as a friend, use the show and compare profile function. This function triggers a bottom sheet dialog showing the Play Games profile of the user; call the function with the player Id of the requested player. If the player and friend have in-game nicknames, use them in the call to add more context to the profile UI:\n\n```csharp\nPlayGamesPlatform.Instance.ShowCompareProfileWithAlternativeNameHintsUI(\n    mFirstFriendId, /* otherPlayerInGameName= */ null, /* currentPlayerInGameName= */ null,\n    (result) => {\n        // Profile comparison view has closed.\n});\n```\n\n## Player Statistics\n\nThe Player Stats API let you tailor game experiences to specific segments\nof players and different stages of the player lifecycle. You can build\ntailored experiences for each player segment based on how players are\nprogressing, spending, and engaging. For example, you can use this API to\ntake proactive actions to encourage a less active player to re-engage with\nyour game, such as by displaying and promoting new in-game items when the\nplayer signs in.\n\nThe callback takes two parameters:\n1. The result code less than or equal to zero is success.\n        See [CommonStatusCodes](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/common/api/CommonStatusCodes) for all values.\n2. The PlayerStats object of type GooglePlayGames.PlayGamesLocalUser.PlayerStats\n\nFor more information see [Player Stats](https://developers.google.com/games/services/android/stats).\n\nThe player stats are available after authenticating:\n\n```csharp\n    ((PlayGamesLocalUser)Social.localUser).GetStats((rc, stats) =>\n        {\n            // -1 means cached stats, 0 is succeess\n            // see  CommonStatusCodes for all values.\n            if (rc <= 0 && stats.HasDaysSinceLastPlayed()) {\n                Debug.Log(\"It has been \" + stats.DaysSinceLastPlayed + \" days\");\n            }\n        });\n```\n\n## Revealing/Unlocking an Achievement\n\nTo unlock an achievement, use the **Social.ReportProgress** method with a\nprogress value of 100.0f:\n\n```csharp\n    using GooglePlayGames;\n    using UnityEngine.SocialPlatforms;\n    ...\n    // unlock achievement (achievement ID \"Cfjewijawiu_QA\")\n    Social.ReportProgress(\"Cfjewijawiu_QA\", 100.0f, (bool success) => {\n      // handle success or failure\n    });\n```\n\nNotice that according to the expected behavior of\n[Social.ReportProgress](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Social.ReportProgress.html),\na progress of 0.0f means revealing the achievement and a progress of 100.0f\nmeans unlocking the achievement. Therefore, to reveal an achievement (that was\npreviously hidden) without unlocking it, simply call Social.ReportProgress with\na progress of 0.0f.\n\n## Incrementing an Achievement\n\nIf your achievement is incremental, the Play Games implementation of\n**Social.ReportProgress** will try to behave as closely as possible to the\nexpected behavior according to Unity's social API, but may not be exact. For\nthis reason, we recommend that you do not use Social.ReportProgress for\nincremental achievements. Instead, use the\n**PlayGamesPlatform.IncrementAchievement** method, which is a Play Games\nextension.\n\n```csharp\n    using GooglePlayGames;\n    using UnityEngine.SocialPlatforms;\n    ...\n    // increment achievement (achievement ID \"Cfjewijawiu_QA\") by 5 steps\n    PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.IncrementAchievement(\n        \"Cfjewijawiu_QA\", 5, (bool success) => {\n            // handle success or failure\n    });\n```\n\n## Posting a Score to a Leaderboard\n\nTo post a score to a leaderboard, call **Social.ReportScore**.\n\n```csharp\n    using GooglePlayGames;\n    using UnityEngine.SocialPlatforms;\n    ...\n    // post score 12345 to leaderboard ID \"Cfji293fjsie_QA\")\n    Social.ReportScore(12345, \"Cfji293fjsie_QA\", (bool success) => {\n        // handle success or failure\n    });\n```\n\nTo post a score and include a metadata tag use the Play Game Services instance\ndirectly:\n\n```csharp\n    using GooglePlayGames;\n    using UnityEngine.SocialPlatforms;\n    ...\n    // post score 12345 to leaderboard ID \"Cfji293fjsie_QA\" and tag \"FirstDaily\")\n    Social.ReportScore(12345, \"Cfji293fjsie_QA\", \"FirstDaily\", (bool success) => {\n        // handle success or failure\n    });\n```\n\n\nNote that the platform and the server will automatically discard scores that are\nlower than the player's existing high score, so you can submit scores freely\nwithout any checks to test whether or not the score is greater than the player's\nexisting score.\n\n## Showing the Achievements UI\n\nTo show the built-in UI for all achievements, call\n**Social.ShowAchievementsUI**.\n\n```csharp\n    using GooglePlayGames;\n    using UnityEngine.SocialPlatforms;\n    ...\n    // show achievements UI\n    Social.ShowAchievementsUI();\n```\n\n## Showing the Leaderboard UI\n\nTo show the built-in UI for all leaderboards, call **Social.ShowLeaderboardUI**.\n\n```csharp\n    using GooglePlayGames;\n    using UnityEngine.SocialPlatforms;\n    ...\n    // show leaderboard UI\n    Social.ShowLeaderboardUI();\n```\n\nIf you wish to show a particular leaderboard instead of all leaderboards, you\ncan pass a leaderboard ID to the method. This, however, is a Play Games\nextension, so the Social.Active object needs to be cast to a PlayGamesPlatform\nobject first:\n\n```csharp\n    using GooglePlayGames;\n    using UnityEngine.SocialPlatforms;\n    ...\n    // show leaderboard UI\n    PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.ShowLeaderboardUI(\"Cfji293fjsie_QA\");\n```\n\n## Accessing Leaderboard data\n\nThere are 2 methods to retrieving the leaderboard score data.\n\n### Using Social.ILeaderboard\n\nThis method uses the ILeaderboard interface to define the scope and filters\nfor getting the data.  This approach allows you to configure:\n1. The leaderboard Id\n2. The collection (social or public)\n3. The timeframe (daily, weekly, all-time)\n4. The rank position to start retrieving scores.\n5. The number of scores (the default is 25).\n6. Filter by user id.\n\nIf the from parameter is non-positive, then the results returned are\nplayer-centered, meaning the scores around the current player's score are\nreturned.\n\n```csharp\n    ILeaderboard lb = PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.CreateLeaderboard();\n    lb.id = \"MY_LEADERBOARD_ID\";\n    lb.LoadScores(ok =>\n        {\n            if (ok) {\n                LoadUsersAndDisplay(lb);\n            }\n            else {\n                Debug.Log(\"Error retrieving leaderboardi\");\n            }\n        });\n```\n\n### Using PlayGamesPlatform.LoadScores()\n\nThis method uses the PlayGamesPlatform directly.  This approach provides\nadditional flexibility and information when accessing the leaderboard data.\n\n```csharp\n    PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.LoadScores(\n            GPGSIds.leaderboard_leaders_in_smoketesting,\n            LeaderboardStart.PlayerCentered,\n            100,\n            LeaderboardCollection.Public,\n            LeaderboardTimeSpan.AllTime,\n            (data) =>\n            {\n                mStatus = \"Leaderboard data valid: \" + data.Valid;\n                mStatus += \"\\n approx:\" +data.ApproximateCount + \" have \" + data.Scores.Length;\n            });\n```\n\nThe parameters for LoadScores() are:\n\n1. leaderboardId\n2. start position (top scores or player centered)\n3. row count\n4. leaderboard collection (social or public)\n5. time span (daily, weekly, all-time)\n6. callback accepting a LeaderboardScoreData object.\n\nThe `LeaderboardScoreData` class is used to return information back to the\ncaller when loading scores.  The members are:\n    1. Id - the leaderboard id\n    2. Valid - true if the returned data is valid (the call was successful)\n    3. Status - the ResponseStatus of the call\n    4. ApproximateCount - the approximate number of scores in the leaderboard\n    5. Title - the title of the leaderboard\n    6. PlayerScore - the score of the current player\n    7. Scores - the list of scores\n    8. PrevPageToken - a token that can be used to call `LoadMoreScores()` to\n        get the previous page of scores.\n    9. NextPageToken - a token that can be used to call `LoadMoreScores()` to\n        get the next page of scores.\n\n```csharp\n    void GetNextPage(LeaderboardScoreData data)\n    {\n        PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.LoadMoreScores(data.NextPageToken, 10,\n            (results) =>\n            {\n                mStatus = \"Leaderboard data valid: \" + data.Valid;\n                mStatus += \"\\n approx:\" +data.ApproximateCount + \" have \" + data.Scores.Length;\n            });\n    }\n```\n\nThis call may fail when trying to load friends with `ResponseCode.ResolutionRequired` if the user has not shared their friends list with the game. In this case, use `AskForLoadFriendsResolution` to request access.\n\n### Getting player names\n\nEach score has the userId of the player that made the score.  You can use\n`Social.LoadUsers()` to load the player profile.  Remember that the contents\nof the player profile are subject to privacy settings of the players.\n\n```csharp\n    internal void LoadUsersAndDisplay(ILeaderboard lb)\n    {\n        // get the user ids\n        List<string> userIds = new List<string>();\n\n        foreach(IScore score in lb.scores) {\n            userIds.Add(score.userID);\n        }\n        // load the profiles and display (or in this case, log)\n        Social.LoadUsers(userIds.ToArray(), (users) =>\n            {\n                string status = \"Leaderboard loading: \" + lb.title + \" count = \" +\n                    lb.scores.Length;\n                foreach(IScore score in lb.scores) {\n                    IUserProfile user = FindUser(users, score.userID);\n                    status += \"\\n\" + score.formattedValue + \" by \" +\n                        (string)(\n                            (user != null) ? user.userName : \"**unk_\" + score.userID + \"**\");\n                }\n                Debug.log(status);\n            });\n    }\n```\n\n## Recording Events\nIncrementing an event is very simple, just call the following method:\n\n```csharp\n    using GooglePlayGames;\n    ...\n    // Increments the event with Id \"YOUR_EVENT_ID\" by 1\n    PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.Events.IncrementEvent(\"YOUR_EVENT_ID\", 1);\n```\nThis call is \"fire and forget\", it will handle batching and execution for you in the background.\n\n## Saving Game State to the Cloud\n\nFor details on saved games concepts and APIs please refer to the  [documentation](https://developers.google.com/games/services/common/concepts/savedgames).\n\n### Displaying saved games UI ###\n\nThe standard UI for selecting or creating a saved game entry is displayed by calling:\n\n```csharp\n    void ShowSelectUI() {\n        uint maxNumToDisplay = 5;\n        bool allowCreateNew = false;\n        bool allowDelete = true;\n\n        ISavedGameClient savedGameClient = PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.SavedGame;\n        savedGameClient.ShowSelectSavedGameUI(\"Select saved game\",\n            maxNumToDisplay,\n            allowCreateNew,\n            allowDelete,\n            OnSavedGameSelected);\n    }\n\n\n    public void OnSavedGameSelected (SelectUIStatus status, ISavedGameMetadata game) {\n        if (status == SelectUIStatus.SavedGameSelected) {\n            // handle selected game save\n        } else {\n            // handle cancel or error\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n### Opening a saved game ###\n\nIn order to read or write data to a saved game, the saved game needs to be opened. Since the saved game state is cached locally\non the device and saved to the cloud, it is possible to encounter conflicts in the state of the saved data. A conflict\nhappens when a device attempts to save state to the cloud but the data currently on the cloud was written by a different device.\nThese conflicts need to be resolved when opening the saved game data.  There are 2 open methods that handle conflict resolution,\nthe first **OpenWithAutomaticConflictResolution** accepts a standard resolution strategy type and automatically resolves the conflicts.\nThe other method, **OpenWithManualConflictResolution** accepts a callback method to allow the manual resolution of the conflict.\n\nSee __GooglePlayGames/BasicApi/SavedGame/ISavedGameClient.cs__ for more details on these methods.\n\n```csharp\n    void OpenSavedGame(string filename) {\n        ISavedGameClient savedGameClient = PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.SavedGame;\n        savedGameClient.OpenWithAutomaticConflictResolution(filename, DataSource.ReadCacheOrNetwork,\n            ConflictResolutionStrategy.UseLongestPlaytime, OnSavedGameOpened);\n    }\n\n    public void OnSavedGameOpened(SavedGameRequestStatus status, ISavedGameMetadata game) {\n        if (status == SavedGameRequestStatus.Success) {\n            // handle reading or writing of saved game.\n        } else {\n            // handle error\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n### Writing a saved game ###\n\nOnce the saved game file is opened, it can be written to save the game state.  This is done by calling **CommitUpdate**.\nThere are four parameters to CommitUpdate:\n\n1. the saved game metadata passed to the callback passed to one of the Open calls.\n2. the updates to make to the metadata.\n3. the actual byte array of data\n4. a callback to call when the commit is complete.\n\n```csharp\n    void SaveGame (ISavedGameMetadata game, byte[] savedData, TimeSpan totalPlaytime) {\n        ISavedGameClient savedGameClient = PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.SavedGame;\n\n        SavedGameMetadataUpdate.Builder builder = new SavedGameMetadataUpdate.Builder();\n        builder = builder\n            .WithUpdatedPlayedTime(totalPlaytime)\n            .WithUpdatedDescription(\"Saved game at \" + DateTime.Now());\n        if (savedImage != null) {\n            // This assumes that savedImage is an instance of Texture2D\n            // and that you have already called a function equivalent to\n            // getScreenshot() to set savedImage\n            // NOTE: see sample definition of getScreenshot() method below\n            byte[] pngData = savedImage.EncodeToPNG();\n            builder = builder.WithUpdatedPngCoverImage(pngData);\n        }\n        SavedGameMetadataUpdate updatedMetadata = builder.Build();\n        savedGameClient.CommitUpdate(game, updatedMetadata, savedData, OnSavedGameWritten);\n    }\n\n    public void OnSavedGameWritten (SavedGameRequestStatus status, ISavedGameMetadata game) {\n        if (status == SavedGameRequestStatus.Success) {\n            // handle reading or writing of saved game.\n        } else {\n            // handle error\n        }\n    }\n\n    public Texture2D getScreenshot() {\n        // Create a 2D texture that is 1024x700 pixels from which the PNG will be\n        // extracted\n        Texture2D screenShot = new Texture2D(1024, 700);\n\n        // Takes the screenshot from top left hand corner of screen and maps to top\n        // left hand corner of screenShot texture\n        screenShot.ReadPixels(\n            new Rect(0, 0, Screen.width, (Screen.width/1024)*700), 0, 0);\n        return screenShot;\n    }\n\n```\n\n### Reading a saved game ###\n\nOnce the saved game file is opened, it can be read to load the game state.  This is done by calling **ReadBinaryData**.\n\n\n```csharp\n    void LoadGameData (ISavedGameMetadata game) {\n        ISavedGameClient savedGameClient = PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.SavedGame;\n        savedGameClient.ReadBinaryData(game, OnSavedGameDataRead);\n    }\n\n    public void OnSavedGameDataRead (SavedGameRequestStatus status, byte[] data) {\n        if (status == SavedGameRequestStatus.Success) {\n            // handle processing the byte array data\n        } else {\n            // handle error\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n### Deleting a saved game ###\n\nOnce the saved game file is opened, it can be deleted. This is done by calling **Delete**.\n\n\n```csharp\n    void DeleteGameData (string filename) {\n        // Open the file to get the metadata.\n        ISavedGameClient savedGameClient = PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.SavedGame;\n        savedGameClient.OpenWithAutomaticConflictResolution(filename, DataSource.ReadCacheOrNetwork,\n            ConflictResolutionStrategy.UseLongestPlaytime, DeleteSavedGame);\n    }\n\n    public void DeleteSavedGame(SavedGameRequestStatus status, ISavedGameMetadata game) {\n        if (status == SavedGameRequestStatus.Success) {\n            ISavedGameClient savedGameClient = PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.SavedGame;\n            savedGameClient.Delete(game);\n        } else {\n            // handle error\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n## Retrieving server authentication codes ##\nIn order to access Google APIs on a backend web server on behalf of the current\nplayer, you need to get an authentication code from the client application and\npass this to your web server application.  This code can then be exchanged for\nan access token to make calls to the various APIs.\nFor more details on this flow see: [Google Sign-In for Websites](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/server-side-flow).\n\nTo get the server side access code:\n1. Configure the web client id of the web application linked to your game in the\nPlay Game Console.\n2. Call `PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.RequestServerSideAccess` once the player is\n  authenticated to get the server side access code.\n3. Pass this code to your server application.\n\n```csharp\n  PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.RequestServerSideAccess(\n    /* forceRefreshToken= */ false,\n    code -> {\n      // send code to server\n    });\n```\n\n## Decreasing apk size\n\nIt is possible to decrease the size of the Play Games Services Unity Plugin by removing code for the Play Games Services features that your game doesn\u2019t use by using Proguard. Proguard will remove the Play Games Unity plugin code for features that are not used in your game, so your game ships with only the code that is needed and minimizes the size impact of using Play Games Services.\n\nAdditionally, it is possible to reduce the size of the entire Unity project using Unity\u2019s [Managed Code Stripping](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ManagedCodeStripping.html), which will compress your entire project.  This can be used in conjunction with Proguard.\n\n### Play Games Services Proguard configuration\n\n1. Go to `File > Build Settings > Player Settings` and click `Publishing Settings` section. Choose `Proguard` for `Minify > Release`. Then, enable `User Proguard File`. If you want the plugin to be proguarded for debug apks as well, you can choose `Proguard` for `Minify > Debug`.\n2. Copy the content of [the proguard configuration](scripts/proguard.txt) into `Assets/Plugins/Android/proguard-user.txt`.\n\n## (Advanced) Using the Plugin Without Overriding the Default Social Platform\n\nWhen you call `PlayGamesPlatform.Activate`, Google Play Games becomes your default social platform implementation, which means that static calls to methods in `Social` and `Social.Active` will be carried out by the Google Play Games plugin. This is the desired behavior for most games using the plugin.\n\nHowever, if for some reason you wish to keep the default implementation accessible (for example, to use it to submit achievements and leaderboards to a different social platform), you can use the Google Play Games plugin without overriding the default one. To do this:\n\n1. Do not call `PlayGamesPlatform.Activate`\n2. If `Xyz` is the name of a method you wish to call on the `Social` class, do not call `Social.Xyz`. Instead, call `PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.Xyz`\n3. Do not use `Social.Active` when interacting with Google Play Games. Instead, use `PlayGamesPlatform.Instance`.\n\nThat way, you can even submit scores and achievements simultaneously to two or more social platforms:\n\n```csharp\n    // Submit achievement to original default social platform\n    Social.ReportProgress(\"MyAchievementIdHere\", 100.0f, callback);\n\n    // Submit achievement to Google Play\n    PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.ReportProgress(\"MyGooglePlayAchievementIdHere\", 100.0f, callback);\n```\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nThis section lists people who have contributed to this project by writing code, improving documentation or fixing bugs.\n\n* [Dgizusse](https://github.com/Dgizusse) for figuring out that setting JAVA_HOME is necessary on Windows.\n* [antonlicht](https://github.com/antonlicht) for fixing a bug with the parameter type of showErrorDialog on the support library.\n* [pR0Ps](https://github.com/pR0Ps) for fixing an issue where OnAchievementsLoaded was not accepting an OPERATION_DEFERRED result code as a success.\n* [friikyeu](https://github.com/friikyeu) for helping debug [an issue](https://github.com/playgameservices/play-games-plugin-for-unity/issues/25) that caused API calls to be queued up rather than executed even when connected.\n"

Airtest uses image recognition technology to locate UI elements so that you can automate games and apps without injecting any code. \n\n*   **Fully Scalable:** Airtest cases can be easily run on large device farms, using commandline or python API. HTML reports with detailed info and screen recording allow you to quickly locate failure points. NetEase builds [Airlab](https://airlab.163.com/) on top of the Airtest Project.\n\n*   **AirtestIDE:** AirtestIDE is an out of the box GUI tool that helps to create and run cases in a user-friendly way. AirtestIDE supports a complete automation workflow: ``create -> run -> report``.\n\n*   **Poco:** [Poco](https://github.com/AirtestProject/Poco) adds the ability to directly access object(UI widget) hierarchy across the major platforms and game engines. It allows writing instructions in Python, to achieve more advanced automation.\n\nGet started from [airtest homepage](http://airtest.netease.com/)\n\n#### [Supported Platforms](./docs/wiki/device/platforms.md)\n\n\n## Installation\n\nUse `pip` to install the Airtest python library. \n\n```Shell\npip install -U airtest\n```\n\nOn MacOS/Linux platform, you need to grant adb execute permission.\n\n```Shell\n# for mac\ncd {your_python_path}/site-packages/airtest/core/android/static/adb/mac\n# for linux\n# cd {your_python_path}/site-packages/airtest/core/android/static/adb/linux\nchmod +x adb\n```\n\nDownload AirtestIDE from our [homepage](http://airtest.netease.com/) if you need to use the GUI tool.\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nYou can find the complete Airtest documentation on [readthedocs](http://airtest.readthedocs.io/).\n\n\n## Examples\n\nAirtest aims at providing platform-independent API so that you can write automated cases once and run it on multiple devices and platforms.\n\n1. Using [connect_device](http://airtest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README_MORE.html#connect-device) API you can connect to any android/iOS device or windows application.\n1. Then perform [simulated input](http://airtest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README_MORE.html#simulate-input) to automate your game or app.\n1. **DO NOT** forget to [make assertions](http://airtest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README_MORE.html#make-assertion) of the expected result. \n\n```Python\nfrom airtest.core.api import *\n\n# connect an android phone with adb\ninit_device(\"Android\")\n# or use connect_device api\n# connect_device(\"Android:///\")\n\ninstall(\"path/to/your/apk\")\nstart_app(\"package_name_of_your_apk\")\ntouch(Template(\"image_of_a_button.png\"))\nswipe(Template(\"slide_start.png\"), Template(\"slide_end.png\"))\nassert_exists(Template(\"success.png\"))\nkeyevent(\"BACK\")\nhome()\nuninstall(\"package_name_of_your_apk\")\n```\n\nFor more detailed info, please refer to [Airtest Python API reference](http://airtest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/all_module/airtest.core.api.html) or take a look at [API code](./airtest/core/api.py)\n\n\n## Running ``.air`` cases from CLI\n\nUsing AirtestIDE, you can easily create automated cases as ``.air`` directories.\nAirtest CLI provides the possibility to execute cases on different host machines and target device platforms without using AirtestIDE itself.\n\n```Shell\n# run cases targeting on Android phone connected to your host machine via ADB\nairtest run \"path to your .air dir\" --device Android:///\n\n# run cases targeting on Windows application whose title matches Unity.*\nairtest run \"path to your .air dir\" --device \"Windows:///?title_re=Unity.*\"\n\n# generate HTML report after running cases\nairtest report \"path to your .air dir\"\n\n# or use as a python module\npython -m airtest run \"path to your .air dir\" --device Android:///\n```\n\nTry running provided example case: [``airtest/playground/test_blackjack.air``](./playground/test_blackjack.air) and see [Usage of CLI](http://airtest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README_MORE.html#running-air-from-cli). Here is a [multi-device runner sample](https://github.com/AirtestProject/multi-device-runner).\n\n\n## Contribution\n\nPull requests are very welcome. \n\n\n## Thanks\n\nThanks for all these great works that make this project better.\n\n- [stf](https://github.com/openstf)\n- [atx](https://github.com/NetEaseGame/ATX)\n- [pywinauto](https://github.com/pywinauto/pywinauto)\n"

Store or Discover.\nBut can also be accessed [**here**](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl)\n\n#### Debian, Ubuntu and Derivatives\n\nDownload the `heroic_x.x.x_amd64.deb` from the Releases section\n\n```bash\nsudo dpkg -i heroic_x.x.x_amd64.deb\n```\n\n#### Debian (third party `apt` repository)\n\nYou can add the [**MAD Linux**](https://madlinux.sourceforge.io) [`apt` repository](https://gitlab.com/myawesomedistro/madrepo):\n\n```bash\nbash <(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/main/madrepo.sh)\n```\n\nIf you need support on it, get access to **MAD Linux** [**Guilded**](https://guilded.gg/madlinux) server.\n\nMaybe you want to boost the download speed on updates with [`apt-fast`](https://github.com/ilikenwf/apt-fast):\n\n```bash\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:apt-fast/stable\nsudo apt install -y apt-fast\napt-fast install -y heroic\n```\n\n#### Arch (AUR)\n\n[![AUR version](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/heroic-games-launcher-bin?style=flat&label=AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/heroic-games-launcher-bin/)\n\nAUR page: [https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/heroic-games-launcher-bin/](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/heroic-games-launcher-bin/)\n\nTo install it manually use:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://aur.archlinux.org/heroic-games-launcher-bin.git\n\ncd heroic-games-launcher-bin\n\nmakepkg --cleanbuild --syncdeps --install --clean --rmdeps\n```\n\nOtherwise you can install it via your prefered AUR helper, e.g. yay.\n\n#### Fedora\n\nHeroic for Fedora is available on [the COPR repo](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/atim/heroic-games-launcher/) or as the binary on the releases page.\n\n#### Other Distributions (AppImage and TAR.XZ)\n\nDownload the `heroic-x.x.x.AppImage` or `heroic-x.x.x.tar.xz` from the Releases section.\nMake sure you have Curl and Gawk, normally it comes with most distros but check for them if you have any issue.\n\nTo make the AppImage it executable use:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x heroic-x.x.x.AppImage\n```\n\nTo run it use:\n\n```bash\n./heroic-x.x.x.AppImage\n```\n\nFor the tar.xz file, you need first to extract it somewhere, enter the folder and run:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x heroic\n```\n\nTo run it use:\n\n```bash\n./heroic\n```\n\n### Windows\n\nIf you use WinGet, just type: `winget install HeroicGamesLauncher.HeroicGamesLauncher`. otherwise\ndownload Heroic.Setup.x.x.x.exe or the Portable Heroic-x.x.x.exe file and run it. It will install it to the start menu and desktop, use those to run it.\n\n### macOS\n\nIf you use Homebrew, just type: `brew install --cask heroic`. Otherwise, download Heroic-x.x.x.dmg and move the Heroic App to the Applications folder.\n\n### Build binaries locally (All platforms)\n\n- All Platforms:\n  Requires NodeJS to build \\\n  Use yarn or npm\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher.git\n\ncd HeroicGamesLauncher\n```\n\n- Build for Linux:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n\nyarn dist {package to create} (eg: deb, pacman, tar.xz, rpm, AppImage)\n```\n\n- Build for Windows (Beta):\n\n```bash\nyarn.cmd (or npm install)\n\nyarn.cmd (or npm run) dist-win\n```\n\n- Build for Mac (Alpha):\n\n```bash\nyarn (or npm install)\n\nyarn (or npm run) dist-mac\n```\n\n### Any OS (development environment)\n\n1. Download Yarn and Node.js\n2. Download the dependencies with `yarn`\n3. Go to the debug tab on vscode and start the two tasks, 'Start renderer process' and 'Debug main process' or `yarn react-start && yarn electron`\n\n### Building with VS Code\n\n1. Download Yarn and Node.js\n2. Download the dependencies with `yarn`\n3. Open the tasks. Select \"Build with [your OS]\"\n\n### Development Using a Container\n\nIf you would prefer, we have a docker container defined to develop / build Heroic with (a potential reason being to avoid loading tons of dependencies on your host filesystem). There are two methods, based on whether you use VS Code.\n\n**VS Code**\n\nThere is a `.devcontainer` directory containing a definition that VS Code will recognize for automatically opening your local Heroic directory in a container in VS Code.\n\n**NOTE: this requires that you install the 'Remote - Containers' extension.**\n\n1. Open the root of your local Heroic directory in VS Code.\n2. You should get a prompt in the bottom right to build and open the project in the dev container.\n3. If the above prompt does not occur, on the bottom left, there is a green icon that should be there if the remote extension is installed. Click on it, and select \"Reopen in container\".\n4. The bottom left green icon should now say: \"Dev Container: Heroic Games Launcher\".\n\nAfter the container's package manager runs, open a new terminal session and you should be able to run bash commands from within the container. Any yarn dist builds should also now show up on your host filesystem.\n\n**Manually Building the Docker Image**\n\nIf you don't use VS Code or don't want it integrated with the container, you can build and run the container manually using either Docker or Podman.\n\n1. From the root of your local Heroic directory, run:\n\n```bash\ndocker build -t heroicdevcontainer -f Dockerfile .\n```\n\n2. Assuming all went well, you can now enter the container:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it -v ./:/tmp/heroic localhost/heroicdevcontainer:latest\n```\n\n3. The above command will mount your local Heroic dir to `/tmp/heroic` in the container (unless you used a different path).\n\n```\ncd /tmp/heroic\n```\n\nAnd you should be good to go, code and build away!\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![epic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26871415/168448807-768a2ffc-7c6b-4010-bc48-b2f6acec9a32.png)\n![gog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26871415/168448826-3fab90d7-7fba-4774-96d9-064f53fe718a.png)\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26871415/168449037-62ccfa8b-6e91-4cbf-bd37-48087f2ce998.png)\n![gamepage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26871415/168449021-222673fd-675a-4a17-9e5b-907d99919e11.png)\n\n[![jump](https://img.shields.io/badge/Back%20to%20top-%20?style=flat&color=grey&logo=data:image/svg%2bxml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjRweCIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDI0IDI0IiB3aWR0aD0iMjRweCIgZmlsbD0iI0ZGRkZGRiI+PHBhdGggZD0iTTAgMGgyNHYyNEgwVjB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZD0iTTQgMTJsMS40MSAxLjQxTDExIDcuODNWMjBoMlY3LjgzbDUuNTggNS41OUwyMCAxMmwtOC04LTggOHoiLz48L3N2Zz4=)](#heroic-games-launcher)\n"

Works in all major browsers and can be combined with your favorite js library.\n\n\n## Using Crafty\n\nA simple game of pong:\n```javascript\nCrafty.init(600, 300);\nCrafty.background('rgb(127,127,127)');\n\n//Paddles\nCrafty.e(\"Paddle, 2D, DOM, Color, Multiway\")\n    .color('rgb(255,0,0)')\n    .attr({ x: 20, y: 100, w: 10, h: 100 })\n    .multiway(200, { W: -90, S: 90 });\nCrafty.e(\"Paddle, 2D, DOM, Color, Multiway\")\n    .color('rgb(0,255,0)')\n    .attr({ x: 580, y: 100, w: 10, h: 100 })\n    .multiway(200, { UP_ARROW: -90, DOWN_ARROW: 90 });\n\n//Ball\nCrafty.e(\"2D, DOM, Color, Collision\")\n    .color('rgb(0,0,255)')\n    .attr({ x: 300, y: 150, w: 10, h: 10,\n            dX: Crafty.math.randomInt(2, 5),\n            dY: Crafty.math.randomInt(2, 5) })\n    .bind('UpdateFrame', function () {\n        //hit floor or roof\n        if (this.y <= 0 || this.y >= 290)\n            this.dY *= -1;\n\n        // hit left or right boundary\n        if (this.x > 600) {\n            this.x = 300;\n            Crafty(\"LeftPoints\").each(function () {\n                this.text(++this.points + \" Points\") });\n        }\n        if (this.x < 10) {\n            this.x = 300;\n            Crafty(\"RightPoints\").each(function () {\n                this.text(++this.points + \" Points\") });\n        }\n\n        this.x += this.dX;\n        this.y += this.dY;\n    })\n    .onHit('Paddle', function () {\n        this.dX *= -1;\n    });\n\n//Score boards\nCrafty.e(\"LeftPoints, DOM, 2D, Text\")\n    .attr({ x: 20, y: 20, w: 100, h: 20, points: 0 })\n    .text(\"0 Points\");\nCrafty.e(\"RightPoints, DOM, 2D, Text\")\n    .attr({ x: 515, y: 20, w: 100, h: 20, points: 0 })\n    .text(\"0 Points\");\n```\n_Left paddle is controlled by `W` & `S`, right paddle by `UpArrow` & `DownArrow`._   \n[Check it out online and try to modify it yourself here](https://jsfiddle.net/mucaho/yL3v48r6/).\n\n## Developing\n\nIf you want to fix a bug, please submit a pull request against the development branch.  Some guides to help you can be found [on the wiki](https://github.com/craftyjs/Crafty/wiki)\n\nIf you would like to make larger contributions please catch us in the [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/craftyjs) and we will help you get started. Much appreciated :-)\n\n\n### Quick build instructions\n\nThe easiest way to build crafty is to use [gruntjs](http://gruntjs.com/), which requires [node](nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/).  If you have grunt, node, and npm already installed, then run `npm install` from Crafty's root directory.  (This will pull down about 30MB of node packages.)  From then on, just run `grunt` to build.\n\nYou can also use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of npm.\n\n([Full instructions here](https://github.com/craftyjs/Crafty/wiki/Building).)\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Using Deep Q Networks to Learn Video Game Strategies\n#### Nikita Srivatsan, Ivan Kuznetsov, Willis Wang\n\n## 1. Abstract\n\nIn this project, we apply a deep learning model recently developed by Minh et al 2015 [1] to learn optimal control patterns from visual input using reinforcement learning. While this method is highly generalizable, we applied it to the problem of video game strategy, specifically for Pong and Tetris. Given raw pixel values from the screen, we used a convolutional neural network trained with Q learning to approximate future expected reward for any possible action, and then selected an action based on the best possible outcome. We find that this method is capable of generalizing to new problems with no adjustment of the model architecture. After sufficient training, our Pong model achieved better than human performance on the games, demonstrating the potential for deep learning as a powerful and generalizable method for learning high-level control schemes.\n\n## 2. Background\n\nReinforcement learning develops control patterns by providing feedback on a model\u2019s selected actions, which encourages the model to select better actions in the future. At each time step, given some state s, the model will select an action a, and then observe the new state s' and a reward r based on some optimality criterion.\n\nWe specifically used a method known as Q learning, which approximates the maximum expected return for performing an action at a given state using an action-value (Q) function. Specifically, return gives the sum of the rewards until the game terminates, where the reward is discounted by a factor of \u03b3 at each time step. We formally define this as:\n\n![alt-text](http://imgur.com/h7MJxSJ.png \"(1)\")\n\nWe then define the action-value function:\n\n![alt-text](http://imgur.com/05MxGxk.png \"(2)\")\n\nNote that if the optimal Q function is known for state s', we can write the optimal Q function at preceding state s as the maximum expected value of ![alt-text](http://imgur.com/1RSOCHo.png \"Sorry, no alt-text for this one\"). This identity is known as the Bellman equation:\n\n![alt-text](http://imgur.com/BERyjr2.png \"(3)\")\n\nThe intuition behind reinforcement learning is to continually update the action-value function based on observations using the Bellman equation. It has been shown by Sutton et al 1998 [2] that such update algorithms will converge on the optimal action-value function as time approaches infinity. Based on this, we can define Q as the output of a neural network, which has weights \u03b8, and train this network by minimizing the following loss function at each iteration i:\n\n![alt-text](http://imgur.com/3gFka35.png \"(4)\")\n\nWhere y_i represents the target function we want to approach during each iteration. It is defined as:\n\n![alt-text](http://imgur.com/gKcXJfi.png \"(5)\")\n\nNote that when i is equal to the final iteration of an episode (colloquially the end of a game), the Q function should be 0 since it is impossible to attain additional reward after the game has ended. Therefore, when i equals the terminal frame of an episode, we can simply write:\n\n![alt-text](http://imgur.com/nU8qRJM.png \"(6)\")\n\n## 3. Related Work\n\nTraditional approaches use an array to approximate the action-value function. However, this method does not scale well as the complexity of the system increases. Tesauro 1995 [3] proposed TD-Gammon, a method of using a multilayer perceptron with one hidden layer. This method worked well on the backgammon game, but failed to generalize to new problems.\n\nMore recently Riedmiller 2005 [4] used a system called neural-fitted Q learning, which used a multilayer perceptron to approximate the Q function. However, the approach had issues as it trained in batch updates with cost proportional to the size of the dataset, which limits the scalability of the system. Also, the tasks which Riedmiller considered had a very low dimensional state space. For the problem of video games, however, it is necessary to consider incredibly high dimensional visual input, and not allow our system to know anything about the internal game state or the rules of the game.\n\nMinh et al 2015 [1] proposed deep Q learning, where a deep convolutional neural network is used to calculate the Q function. Convolutional neural networks are particularly well suited to the visual state space of video games. Furthermore, they also proposed a new method for training the network. While online approaches have a tendency to diverge or overfit, and training on the entire dataset is quite costly, Minh et al 2015 trained on minibatches sampled from a replay memory. The replay memory contains all previously seen state transitions, and the associated action and reward. At each time step a minibatch of transitions is sampled from the replay memory and the loss function described above is minimized for that batch with respect to the network weights.\n\nThis approach carries many advantages in addition to the aforementioned computational cost benefits. By using a replay memory, each experience can be used in multiple updates, which means that the data is being used more effectively. Also, using an online approach has the disadvantage that all consecutive updates will be over highly correlated states. This can cause the network to get stuck in a poor local optimum, or to diverge dramatically. Using a batched approach over more varied experiences smooths out the updates and avoids this problem.\n\n## 4. Deep Q Learning Algorithm\n\nThe pseudo-code for the Deep Q Learning algorithm, as given in [1], can be found below:\n\n```\nInitialize replay memory D to size N\nInitialize action-value function Q with random weights\nfor episode = 1, M do\n\tInitialize state s_1\n\tfor t = 1, T do\n\t\tWith probability \u03f5 select random action a_t\n\t\totherwise select a_t=argmax_a  Q(s_t,a; \u03b8_i)\n\t\tExecute action a_t in emulator and observe r_t and s_(t+1)\n\t\tStore transition (s_t,a_t,r_t,s_(t+1)) in D\n\t\tSample a minibatch of transitions (s_j,a_j,r_j,s_(j+1)) from D\n\t\tSet y_j:=\n\t\t\tr_j for terminal s_(j+1)\n\t\t\tr_j+\u03b3*max_(a^' )  Q(s_(j+1),a'; \u03b8_i) for non-terminal s_(j+1)\n\t\tPerform a gradient step on (y_j-Q(s_j,a_j; \u03b8_i))^2 with respect to \u03b8\n\tend for\nend for\n```\n\n## 5. Experimental Methods\n\nThe network was trained on the raw pixel values observed from the game at each time step. We preprocessed the images by converting to grayscale, resizing them to 80x80, and then stacked together the last four frames to produce an 80x80x4 input array.\n\nThe architecture of the network is described in Figure 1 below. The first layer convolves the input image with an 8x8x4x32 kernel at a stride size of 4. The output is then put through a 2x2 max pooling layer. The second layer convolves with a 4x4x32x64 kernel at a stride of 2. We then max pool again. The third layer convolves with a 3x3x64x64 kernel at a stride of 1. We then max pool one more time. The last hidden layer consists of 256 fully connected ReLU nodes.\n\n![alt-text](http://imgur.com/mfatQrY.png \"Figure 1\")\n\nThe output layer, obtained with a simple matrix multiplication, has the same dimensionality as the number of valid actions which can be performed in the game, where the 0th index always corresponds to doing nothing. The values at this output layer represent the Q function given the input state for each valid action. At each time step, the network performs whichever action corresponds to the highest Q value using a \u03f5 greedy policy.\n\nAt startup, we initialize all weight matrices randomly using a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0.01. Bias variables are all initialized at 0.01. We then initialize the replay memory with a max size of 500,000 observations.\n\nWe start training by choosing actions uniformly at random for 50,000 time steps, without updating the network weights. This allows us to populate the replay memory before training begins. After that, we linearly anneal \u03f5 from 1 to 0.1 over the course of the next 500,000 frames. During this time, at each time step, the network samples minibatches of size 100 from the replay memory to train on, and performs a gradient step on the loss function described above using the Adam optimization algorithm with a learning rate of 0.000001. After annealing finishes, the network continues to train indefinitely, with \u03f5 fixed at 0.1.\n\nAn Amazon Web Services G2 large instance was used to efficiently conduct training on a GPU. We implemented the DQN in Google\u2019s newly released TensorFlow library.\n\n## 6. Results\n\nSee these links for videos of the DQN in action:\n\n[DQN playing a long game of Pong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE_KKM0e38s)\n\n[Visualization of convolutional layers and Q function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9jGIzkVCsM)\n\nWe found that for Pong, good results were achieved after approximately 1.38 million time steps, which corresponds to about 25 hours of game time. Qualitatively, the network played at the level of an experienced human player, usually beating the game with a score of 20-2. Figure 2 shows the maximum Q value for the first ~20,000 training steps. To minimize clutter, only maximum Q values corresponding to the first 100 training steps of each consecutive group of 1,250 training steps are shown. As can be seen, the maximum Q value increases over time. This indicates improvement as it means that the network is expecting to receive a greater reward per game as it trains for longer. In theory, as we continue to train the network, the value of the maximum Q value should plateau as the network reaches an optimal state.\n\n![alt-text](http://imgur.com/rnLVmyd.png \"Figure 2\")\n\nThe final hidden representation of the input image frames in the network was a 256 dimensional vector. Figure 3 shows t-SNE embedding of ~1,200 such representations which were sampled over a period of 2 hours with fixed network weights which had been learned after 25 hours of training. The points in the visualization were also color-coded based on the maximum Q values at the output layer for that frame.\n\n![alt-text](http://imgur.com/hCj7BCG.png \"Figure 3\")\n\nThe network controlled paddle is on the left and highlighted yellow for easy visualization. The paddle controlled by the \u201copponent,\u201d a hard-coded AI built into the game, is on the right. As can be seen from the image frames, high maximum Q-values correspond to when the ball was near the opponent's paddle, so the network had a high probability of scoring. Similarly, low maximum Q-values correspond to when the ball was near the network's paddle, so the network had an increased chance of losing the points. When the ball is in the center of the court, a neutral maximum Q value occurs.\n\nWe are also currently actively working on getting the system to learn Tetris as well. This section will be updated as further progress in this direction is made.\n\n## 7. Conclusions\n\nWe utilized deep Q learning to train a neural network to play Pong and partially to play Tetris from just images of the current game screen and no knowledge of the internal game state. Qualitatively, the trained Pong network appeared to perform near human level. We are still working on training the system to play Tetris, and will hopefully report good results in the near future.\n\nWe then went on to show that the Pong network has a relatively high level \u201cunderstanding\u201d of the current state of the game. For example, the Pong network\u2019s function was maximized when the ball was near the opponent's paddle, when it would be reasonable to expect a point. However, it was minimized when the ball was near the network\u2019s paddle, as there was a chance it could lose the point.\n\nSignificant improvements on the current network architecture are possible. For example, our implementation of max pooling may have been unnecessary, as it caused the convolution kernels in the deeper layers to have a size comparable to that of the previous layer itself. Hence, max pooling may have discarded useful information. Given more time, it would be nice to perform more tuning over the various network parameters, such as the learning rate, the batch size, the replay memory, and the lengths of the observation and exploration phases. Additionally, we could check the performance of the network if the game parameters are tweaked (e.g. the angle of the ball\u2019s bounce is changed slightly). This would yield important information about the network\u2019s ability to extrapolate to new situations.\n\nBased on the difference in results between Tetris and Pong, we should also expect the system to converge faster for games which provide rewards (either positive or negative) very frequently, even while the network is acting randomly. This leads us to believe that while our system should theoretically be able to learn any game, it might achieve human-level performance faster for genres like fighting games or other similar types in which the game score changes rapidly over a short amount of time. This might be another interesting future direction to explore.\n\nUltimately, the results obtained here demonstrate the usefulness of convolutional neural networks to perform deep Q learning as proposed in [1]. However, we have only applied these methods to relatively simple games; CNNs have also been used in much more complex image processing and object recognition. This would indicate that we can apply similar techniques to those described here to much more challenging tasks. Further research well undoubtedly lead to interesting results in this field.\n\n## 8.

Based on this, we can define Q as the output of a neural network, which has weights \u03b8, and train this network by minimizing the following loss function at each iteration i:\n\n![alt-text](http://imgur.com/3gFka35.png \"(4)\")\n\nWhere y_i represents the target function we want to approach during each iteration. It is defined as:\n\n![alt-text](http://imgur.com/gKcXJfi.png \"(5)\")\n\nNote that when i is equal to the final iteration of an episode (colloquially the end of a game), the Q function should be 0 since it is impossible to attain additional reward after the game has ended. Therefore, when i equals the terminal frame of an episode, we can simply write:\n\n![alt-text](http://imgur.com/nU8qRJM.png \"(6)\")\n\n## 3. Related Work\n\nTraditional approaches use an array to approximate the action-value function. However, this method does not scale well as the complexity of the system increases. Tesauro 1995 [3] proposed TD-Gammon, a method of using a multilayer perceptron with one hidden layer. This method worked well on the backgammon game, but failed to generalize to new problems.\n\nMore recently Riedmiller 2005 [4] used a system called neural-fitted Q learning, which used a multilayer perceptron to approximate the Q function. However, the approach had issues as it trained in batch updates with cost proportional to the size of the dataset, which limits the scalability of the system. Also, the tasks which Riedmiller considered had a very low dimensional state space. For the problem of video games, however, it is necessary to consider incredibly high dimensional visual input, and not allow our system to know anything about the internal game state or the rules of the game.\n\nMinh et al 2015 [1] proposed deep Q learning, where a deep convolutional neural network is used to calculate the Q function. Convolutional neural networks are particularly well suited to the visual state space of video games. Furthermore, they also proposed a new method for training the network. While online approaches have a tendency to diverge or overfit, and training on the entire dataset is quite costly, Minh et al 2015 trained on minibatches sampled from a replay memory. The replay memory contains all previously seen state transitions, and the associated action and reward. At each time step a minibatch of transitions is sampled from the replay memory and the loss function described above is minimized for that batch with respect to the network weights.\n\nThis approach carries many advantages in addition to the aforementioned computational cost benefits. By using a replay memory, each experience can be used in multiple updates, which means that the data is being used more effectively. Also, using an online approach has the disadvantage that all consecutive updates will be over highly correlated states. This can cause the network to get stuck in a poor local optimum, or to diverge dramatically. Using a batched approach over more varied experiences smooths out the updates and avoids this problem.\n\n## 4. Deep Q Learning Algorithm\n\nThe pseudo-code for the Deep Q Learning algorithm, as given in [1], can be found below:\n\n```\nInitialize replay memory D to size N\nInitialize action-value function Q with random weights\nfor episode = 1, M do\n\tInitialize state s_1\n\tfor t = 1, T do\n\t\tWith probability \u03f5 select random action a_t\n\t\totherwise select a_t=argmax_a  Q(s_t,a; \u03b8_i)\n\t\tExecute action a_t in emulator and observe r_t and s_(t+1)\n\t\tStore transition (s_t,a_t,r_t,s_(t+1)) in D\n\t\tSample a minibatch of transitions (s_j,a_j,r_j,s_(j+1)) from D\n\t\tSet y_j:=\n\t\t\tr_j for terminal s_(j+1)\n\t\t\tr_j+\u03b3*max_(a^' )  Q(s_(j+1),a'; \u03b8_i) for non-terminal s_(j+1)\n\t\tPerform a gradient step on (y_j-Q(s_j,a_j; \u03b8_i))^2 with respect to \u03b8\n\tend for\nend for\n```\n\n## 5. Experimental Methods\n\nThe network was trained on the raw pixel values observed from the game at each time step. We preprocessed the images by converting to grayscale, resizing them to 80x80, and then stacked together the last four frames to produce an 80x80x4 input array.\n\nThe architecture of the network is described in Figure 1 below. The first layer convolves the input image with an 8x8x4x32 kernel at a stride size of 4. The output is then put through a 2x2 max pooling layer. The second layer convolves with a 4x4x32x64 kernel at a stride of 2. We then max pool again. The third layer convolves with a 3x3x64x64 kernel at a stride of 1. We then max pool one more time. The last hidden layer consists of 256 fully connected ReLU nodes.\n\n![alt-text](http://imgur.com/mfatQrY.png \"Figure 1\")\n\nThe output layer, obtained with a simple matrix multiplication, has the same dimensionality as the number of valid actions which can be performed in the game, where the 0th index always corresponds to doing nothing. The values at this output layer represent the Q function given the input state for each valid action. At each time step, the network performs whichever action corresponds to the highest Q value using a \u03f5 greedy policy.\n\nAt startup, we initialize all weight matrices randomly using a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0.01. Bias variables are all initialized at 0.01. We then initialize the replay memory with a max size of 500,000 observations.\n\nWe start training by choosing actions uniformly at random for 50,000 time steps, without updating the network weights. This allows us to populate the replay memory before training begins. After that, we linearly anneal \u03f5 from 1 to 0.1 over the course of the next 500,000 frames. During this time, at each time step, the network samples minibatches of size 100 from the replay memory to train on, and performs a gradient step on the loss function described above using the Adam optimization algorithm with a learning rate of 0.000001. After annealing finishes, the network continues to train indefinitely, with \u03f5 fixed at 0.1.\n\nAn Amazon Web Services G2 large instance was used to efficiently conduct training on a GPU. We implemented the DQN in Google\u2019s newly released TensorFlow library.\n\n## 6. Results\n\nSee these links for videos of the DQN in action:\n\n[DQN playing a long game of Pong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE_KKM0e38s)\n\n[Visualization of convolutional layers and Q function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9jGIzkVCsM)\n\nWe found that for Pong, good results were achieved after approximately 1.38 million time steps, which corresponds to about 25 hours of game time. Qualitatively, the network played at the level of an experienced human player, usually beating the game with a score of 20-2. Figure 2 shows the maximum Q value for the first ~20,000 training steps. To minimize clutter, only maximum Q values corresponding to the first 100 training steps of each consecutive group of 1,250 training steps are shown. As can be seen, the maximum Q value increases over time. This indicates improvement as it means that the network is expecting to receive a greater reward per game as it trains for longer. In theory, as we continue to train the network, the value of the maximum Q value should plateau as the network reaches an optimal state.\n\n![alt-text](http://imgur.com/rnLVmyd.png \"Figure 2\")\n\nThe final hidden representation of the input image frames in the network was a 256 dimensional vector. Figure 3 shows t-SNE embedding of ~1,200 such representations which were sampled over a period of 2 hours with fixed network weights which had been learned after 25 hours of training. The points in the visualization were also color-coded based on the maximum Q values at the output layer for that frame.\n\n![alt-text](http://imgur.com/hCj7BCG.png \"Figure 3\")\n\nThe network controlled paddle is on the left and highlighted yellow for easy visualization. The paddle controlled by the \u201copponent,\u201d a hard-coded AI built into the game, is on the right. As can be seen from the image frames, high maximum Q-values correspond to when the ball was near the opponent's paddle, so the network had a high probability of scoring. Similarly, low maximum Q-values correspond to when the ball was near the network's paddle, so the network had an increased chance of losing the points. When the ball is in the center of the court, a neutral maximum Q value occurs.\n\nWe are also currently actively working on getting the system to learn Tetris as well. This section will be updated as further progress in this direction is made.\n\n## 7. Conclusions\n\nWe utilized deep Q learning to train a neural network to play Pong and partially to play Tetris from just images of the current game screen and no knowledge of the internal game state. Qualitatively, the trained Pong network appeared to perform near human level. We are still working on training the system to play Tetris, and will hopefully report good results in the near future.\n\nWe then went on to show that the Pong network has a relatively high level \u201cunderstanding\u201d of the current state of the game. For example, the Pong network\u2019s function was maximized when the ball was near the opponent's paddle, when it would be reasonable to expect a point. However, it was minimized when the ball was near the network\u2019s paddle, as there was a chance it could lose the point.\n\nSignificant improvements on the current network architecture are possible. For example, our implementation of max pooling may have been unnecessary, as it caused the convolution kernels in the deeper layers to have a size comparable to that of the previous layer itself. Hence, max pooling may have discarded useful information. Given more time, it would be nice to perform more tuning over the various network parameters, such as the learning rate, the batch size, the replay memory, and the lengths of the observation and exploration phases. Additionally, we could check the performance of the network if the game parameters are tweaked (e.g. the angle of the ball\u2019s bounce is changed slightly). This would yield important information about the network\u2019s ability to extrapolate to new situations.\n\nBased on the difference in results between Tetris and Pong, we should also expect the system to converge faster for games which provide rewards (either positive or negative) very frequently, even while the network is acting randomly. This leads us to believe that while our system should theoretically be able to learn any game, it might achieve human-level performance faster for genres like fighting games or other similar types in which the game score changes rapidly over a short amount of time. This might be another interesting future direction to explore.\n\nUltimately, the results obtained here demonstrate the usefulness of convolutional neural networks to perform deep Q learning as proposed in [1]. However, we have only applied these methods to relatively simple games; CNNs have also been used in much more complex image processing and object recognition. This would indicate that we can apply similar techniques to those described here to much more challenging tasks. Further research well undoubtedly lead to interesting results in this field.\n\n## 8.

It may run on Node.js or the browser.\n\nIt comes along with an [online demo](http://qiao.github.com/PathFinding.js/visual) to show how the algorithms execute. (The pathfinding speed is slowed down in the demo)\n\nNote that this project only provides path-finding algorithms for 2D space. If you need to work in a 3D environment, then you may use [@schteppe](https://github.com/schteppe)'s [fork](https://github.com/schteppe/PathFinding3D.js).\n\nThere is new documentation being written for PathFinding.js. You can read it [here](http://pathfindingjs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). Note that this is in very early stages and far from complete so keep your eyes open for mistakes and don't hesitate to open a pull request in case you find one.\n\nServer\n------\n\nIf you want to use it in Node.js, you may install it via `npm`.\n\n```bash\nnpm install pathfinding\n```\n\nThen, in your program:\n\n```javascript\nvar PF = require('pathfinding');\n```\n\nSee the `Basic Usage` section below for usage details.\n\n\nBrowser\n-------\n\nIf you have bower installed then you can install it with the following command:\n\n```bash\nbower install pathfinding\n```\n\nBy default bower will install pathfinding under the bower_components folder, so to include it in your page do something like:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"path/to/bower_components/pathfinding/pathfinding-browser.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nYou can also grab a release from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/imor/pathfinding-bower/releases) if you don't use bower.\n\nBasic Usage\n-----------\n\nTo build a grid-map of width 5 and height 3:\n\n```javascript\nvar grid = new PF.Grid(5, 3); \n```\n\nBy default, all the nodes in the grid will be able to be walked through.\nTo set whether a node at a given coordinate is walkable or not, use the `setWalkableAt` method.\n\nFor example, to set the node at (0, 1) to be un-walkable, where 0 is the x coordinate (from left to right), and \n1 is the y coordinate (from up to down):\n\n```javascript\ngrid.setWalkableAt(0, 1, false);\n```\n\nYou may also pass in a matrix while instantiating the `PF.Grid` class.\nIt will initiate all the nodes in the grid with the same walkability indicated by the matrix.\n0 for walkable while 1 for blocked.\n\n```javascript\nvar matrix = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n];\nvar grid = new PF.Grid(matrix);\n```\n\nCurrently there are 10 path-finders bundled in this library, namely:\n\n*  `AStarFinder` *\n*  `BestFirstFinder`\n*  `BreadthFirstFinder` *\n*  `DijkstraFinder` *\n*  `IDAStarFinder.js` *\n*  `JumpPointFinder` *\n*  `OrthogonalJumpPointFinder` *\n*  `BiAStarFinder`\n*  `BiBestFirstFinder`\n*  `BiBreadthFirstFinder` *\n*  `BiDijkstraFinder` *\n\nThe prefix `Bi` for the last four finders in the above list stands for the bi-directional searching strategy.\n\nAlso, Note that only the finders with trailing asterisks are guaranteed to find the shortest path.\n\nTo build a path-finder, say, the `AStarFinder`:\n\n```javascript\nvar finder = new PF.AStarFinder();\n```\n\nTo find a path from (1, 2) to (4, 2), (Note: both the start point and end point should be walkable):\n\n```javascript\nvar path = finder.findPath(1, 2, 4, 2, grid);\n```\n\n`path` will be an array of coordinates including both the start and end positions.\n\nFor the `matrix` defined previously, the `path` will be:\n\n```javascript\n[ [ 1, 2 ], [ 1, 1 ], [ 2, 1 ], [ 3, 1 ], [ 3, 2 ], [ 4, 2 ] ]\n```\n\nBe aware that `grid` will be modified in each path-finding, and will not be usable afterwards. If you want to use a single grid multiple times, create a clone for it before calling `findPath`.\n\n```javascript\nvar gridBackup = grid.clone();\n```\n\n\nAdvanced Usage\n--------------\n\nWhen instantiating path-finders, you may pass in additional parameters to indicate which specific strategies to use.\n\nFor all path-finders, you may indicate whether diagonal movement is allowed. The default value is `false`, which means that the path can only go orthogonally.\n\nIn order to enable diagonal movement:\n\n```javascript\nvar finder = new PF.AStarFinder({\n    allowDiagonal: true\n});\n```\n\nWhen diagonal movement is enabled, you might want to prevent the path from touching the corners of the occupied grid blocks. This is usually desirable if the objects using the path have physical width and can also move between the grid cells.\n\nTo enable the corner crossing prevention:\n\n```javascript\nvar finder = new PF.AStarFinder({\n    allowDiagonal: true,\n    dontCrossCorners: true\n});\n```\n\nNote that `dontCrossCorners` only makes sense when `allowDiagonal` is also used. Currently all algorithms except `JumpPointFinder` support this feature.\n\nFor `AStarFinder`, `BestFirstFinder` and all their `Bi` relatives, you may indicate which heuristic function to use.\n\nThe predefined heuristics are `PF.Heuristic.manhattan`(default), `PF.Heuristic.chebyshev`, `PF.Heuristic.euclidean` and `PF.Heuristic.octile`.\n\nTo use the chebyshev heuristic:\n\n```javascript\nvar finder = new PF.AStarFinder({\n    heuristic: PF.Heuristic.chebyshev\n});\n```\n\nTo build a `BestFirstFinder` with diagonal movement allowed and a custom heuristic function:\n\n```javascript\nvar finder = new PF.BestFirstFinder({\n    allowDiagonal: true,\n    heuristic: function(dx, dy) {\n        return Math.min(dx, dy);\n    }\n});\n```\n\nTo smoothen the path, you may use `PF.Util.smoothenPath`. This routine will return\na new path with the original one unmodified.\n\n```javascript\nvar newPath = PF.Util.smoothenPath(grid, path);\n```\n\nNote that the new path will be compressed as well, i.e. if the original path is\n`[[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4]]`, then the new path will be `[[0, 1], [0, 4]]`.\n\nTo just compress a path without smoothing it, you may use `PF.Util.compressPath`.\n\n```javascript\nvar newPath = PF.Util.compressPath(path);\n```\n\nTo expand the compressed path like `[[0, 1], [0, 4]]` back to `[[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4]]`,\nyou may use `PF.Util.expandPath`.\n\n```javascript\nvar newPath = PF.Util.expandPath(path);\n```\n\n\nDevelopment\n------------\n\nLayout:\n\n    .\n    |-- lib          # browser distribution\n    |-- src          # source code (algorithms only)\n    |-- test         # test scripts\n    |-- utils        # build scripts\n\t|-- benchmark    # benchmarks\n    `-- visual       # visualization\n\nMake sure you have `node.js` installed, then use `npm` to install the dependencies: \n\n    npm install -d \n\nThe build system uses gulp, so make sure you have it installed:\n\n    npm install -d -g gulp\n\nTo build the browser distribution:\n\n    gulp compile\n\nTo run the tests\n(algorithms only, not including the visualization) with\n[mocha](http://mochajs.org/) and [should.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js)\nFirst install mocha:\n\n    npm install -d -g mocha\n\nThen run the tests:\n\n    gulp test\n\nTo run the benchmarks:\n\n    gulp bench\n\nOr if you are feeling lazy, the default gulp task does everything(except running the benchmarks):\n\n    gulp\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n[MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\n\n&copy; 2011-2012 Xueqiao Xu &lt;xueqiaoxu@gmail.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Instead, please file an issue first for discussion. For bugs, I prefer detailed bug reports over pull requests.\n\n## Features\n\n### Collision\n- Continuous collision detection\n- Contact callbacks: begin, end, pre-solve, post-solve\n- Convex polygons and circles\n- Multiple shapes per body\n- One-shot contact manifolds\n- Dynamic tree broadphase\n- Efficient pair management\n- Fast broadphase AABB queries\n- Collision groups and categories\n\n### Physics\n- Continuous physics with time of impact solver\n- Persistent body-joint-contact graph\n- Island solution and sleep management\n- Contact, friction, and restitution\n- Stable stacking with a linear-time solver\n- Revolute, prismatic, distance, pulley, gear, mouse joint, and other joint types\n- Joint limits, motors, and friction\n- Momentum decoupled position correction\n- Fairly accurate reaction forces/impulses\n\n### System\n- Small block and stack allocators\n- Centralized tuning parameters\n- Highly portable C++ with no use of STL containers\n\n### Testbed\n- OpenGL with GLFW\n- Graphical user interface with imgui\n- Extensible test framework\n- Support for loading world dumps\n\n## Building\n- Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/)\n- Ensure CMake is in the user `PATH`\n- Visual Studio: run `build.bat` from the command prompt\n- Otherwise: run `build.sh` from a bash shell\n- Results are in the build sub-folder\n- On Windows you can open box2d.sln\n\n## Building Box2D - Using vcpkg\nYou can download and install Box2D using the [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) dependency manager:\n\n- git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git\n- cd vcpkg\n- ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh\n- ./vcpkg integrate install\n- ./vcpkg install box2d\n\nThe Box2D port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors. If the version is out of date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on the vcpkg repository.\n\nNote: vcpkg support is not provided by the Box2D project\n\n## Building for Xcode\n- Install [CMake](https://cmake.org)\n- Add Cmake to the path in .zprofile (the default Terminal shell is zsh)\n    - export PATH=\"/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin:$PATH\"\n- mkdir build\n- cd build\n- cmake -G Xcode ..\n- open box2d.xcodeproj\n- Select the testbed scheme\n- Edit the scheme to set a custom working directory, make this be in box2d/testbed\n- You can now build and run the testbed\n\n## Installing using CMake\nYou can build and install the library and docs using this command sequence (requires Doxygen):\n```\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake -DBOX2D_BUILD_DOCS=ON ..\ncmake --build .\ncmake --build . --target INSTALL\n```\nOn Windows this tries to install in `Program Files` and thus requires admin privileges. Alternatively you can target another directory using something like this:\n```\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake -DBOX2D_BUILD_DOCS=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=\"C:/packages\" ..\ncmake --build .\ncmake --build . --target INSTALL\n```\n\n## Documentation\n- [Manual](https://box2d.org/documentation/)\n- [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/box2d/)\n- [Discord](https://discord.gg/NKYgCBP)\n\n## License\nBox2D is developed by Erin Catto, and uses the [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).\n\n## Sponsorship\nSupport development of Box2D through [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/erincatto)\n"

  "readme_contents": "# PythonStdioGames\n\nA collection of Python 3 source code for simple, text-based games & simulations to use as example programs.\n\nINSTALL: `pip install --user gamesbyexample`\n\n(Use `pip3` on macOS and Linux.)\n\nRUN LAUNCHER: `python -m gamesbyexample`\n\nI'm not accepting pull requests currently, but feel free to leave comments or send suggestions to al@inventwithpython.com\n\nIf you need help installing Python, visit https://installpython3.com/\n\n\nI Just Found This Web Page, How Do I Play These Games?\n======================================================\n\nFirst, install [the Python interpreter](https://python.org). This comes with the barebones IDLE editor. There are other editors you can use. On Windows, you can also use the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor. [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) is an editor for Windows, Linux, and macOS. You can also use a browser-based editor like [REPL.it](https://repl.it/). These are all free.\n\nThen, click in the `src` and `gamesbyexample` folders in this repo to find the `.py` files of various Python games. For example, this is the code for [snailrace.py](https://github.com/asweigart/PythonStdioGames/blob/master/src/gamesbyexample/snailrace.py). The code for each game its entirely in one `.py` file, so you can copy the code directly into your editor. I recommend typing it in by hand, rather than using copy-paste. This will give you \"muscle memory\" of each part of the code. (Though some of these games require you download a data file into the same folder as your `.py` file.) Then you can run the program. If you get error messages, note the line number in the error message and check for typos you've made.\n\nAfter learning basic syntax, many programmers want to move on to the next step and see how these programming concepts are used in \"real\" programs. Most open source projects are far too large and complicated. These games have been designed to be short, simple, and fun. You can use them as learning examples to see how to make your own programs.\n\nNote that some programs require you to download an extra file from this repo. For example, the `[sudoku.py](https://github.com/asweigart/PythonStdioGames/blob/master/src/gamesbyexample/sudoku.py)` game loads its puzzles from the `[sudokupuzzles.txt](https://github.com/asweigart/PythonStdioGames/blob/master/src/gamesbyexample/sudokupuzzles.txt)` file.\n\n\nAbout this Collection\n=====================\n\nAfter beginners learn the syntax of Python and basic programming concepts (loops, branching, functions, etc.) they often hit a dead-end: \"How do I become better at programming?\" At this point, people will tell them to work on their own practice projects (which leaves them without guidance on what to make and how to make it) or to contribute to open source projects (which can be difficult to find, understand its code base, and get guidance on how to contribute).\n\nWhat helped me learn to code was finding small projects whose source code I copied and then made small adjustments to. This gave me insight on how loops, branching, and functions combined together into actual programs.\n\nTo help others down the same path, I'm creating a collection of example programs aimed at being easy to copy and understand by beginners. These programs (mostly games) have the following constraints:\n\n* They're short, with a limit of 256 lines of code. *This makes them easy to read and understand in one sitting. The shorter the better. The \"256\" number was arbitrarily selected, but this also means programs will fit on 4 or 5 printed pages.*\n* They fit into a single source code file and have no installer. *This makes these games trivial to share by copy/pasting code to a pastebin site. Data/image/save files can be used, but the source should link to some examples in their comments.*\n* They only use the Python standard library. *Fewer things to install means wider compatibility and less chance of failing during environment setup.*\n* They only use stdio text; `print()` and `input()` in Python. *The output being in the same text medium as the text source code makes it less abstract, and easier to see the cause-effect relationship between code and output. This means there's no graphics or mouse input, but makes it simple to port these programs to other languages since they all support stdio text.*\n* They're necessarily turn-based. *Relying on `input()` means the program must wait for the user to enter text, but this means we can't have real-time programs that respond to single key-presses.*\n* They're well commented. *Comments should be aimed at beginners and will be more verbose. The 256-line limit includes comments and whitespace. If the program is too long to include abundant comments and sensible whitespace, the program should be simplified, not the comments.*\n* They use as few programming concepts as possible. *If classes, list comprehensions, recursion, aren't necessary for the program, then they are't used.*\n* **Elegant** and **efficient** code is worthless next to code that is **easy to understand** and **readable**. *These programs are for education, not production. Standard best practices, like not using global variables, can be ignored to make it easier to understand.*\n* They do input validation and are bug free. *It should be impossible to crash a program with bad input or an edge case.*\n* All functions have docstrings. *This is good documentation practice, but also enables the `help()` function to work in the interactive shell.*\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines\n=====================\n\nAdditional guidelines include:\n\n* Don't use f-strings. Raspberry Pis as of 2019 have Python 3.5 installed, and f-strings only came about in 3.6. One guideline for these programs is to be as widely compatible as possible.\n* Some of these programs use the `bext` module, which adds curses-like features like color, clearing the screen, and moving the cursor\n* Include a link to a run-through of the program on https://pythontutor.com so that the student can see how the program runs.\n* Longer, more descriptive variable names are better than shorter ones. Avoid using single-letter variable names except for `i` and `j`, or `x` and `y`.\n* Have comments marked as `# (!)` that describe minor changes that they can make (increasing health, changing difficulty, etc.)\n* Use jsdifflib to create online diffs. *This is an easy way for students to find their own typos when copying the code. An example is here: https://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/diff/*\n* Use `assert` statements to catch common typos the student makes when typing in the code, especially for constants that they may modify.\n* Use Python 3. *The only time Python 2 is appropriate to use is when there's a large existing codebase. But this is for new programmers working on greenfield projects.*\n* Stick to characters in WGL4 character repertoire, which is basically CP 1252, code pages for Cyrillic/Greek/Turkish/Baltic characters, and the MS-DOS era CP437 \"extended ASCII\" encoding. *Windows' command line is the limiting factor here; it can't display all UTF-8 characters.*\n* The source code must be typeable. *Don't put box-drawing or extended ascii characters directly into the source code, but rather make chr() calls instead to acquire these characters.*\n* Time can be a factor, even if the programs aren't real-time. *You can check for time or add pauses in between calls to `input()`, but note that you'll never be able to interrupt when the user is typing.*\n* The `pyperclip` module can be used to interact with the clipboard. *Large amounts of text can be input-ed into or output-ed from the program using the clipboard.*\n* I use %s string interpolation instead of f-strings. *I love f-strings, but they were only introduced in Python 3.6 and I don't want to limit the versions that these programs are compatible with.*\n* For all dictionaries, I have a short comment explaining what types the keys and values are. *For example, # Keys=places, values=strings of the suspect & item there.*\n* Use the \"DOS box-drawing\" characters to draw complicated board games. *Though sticking to +, -, and | for lines is good too since it's simpler.*\n* Player vs player games can often be simpler and shorter than player vs computer games. *This necessarily means that multiplayer games must be \"perfect information\" games since both players can view the screen.*\n* Don't modify mutable objects (e.g. lists) in functions to pass information into/out of the function; only use parameters and return values. *This can make your program seem magical to someone not familiar with the Python Data Model.*\n* Avoid insulting the player when they lose. *This is something I learned from instructing programming classes for kids. They respond poorly to messages like, \"Game Over, Dummy!\" even if they seem innocuous to adults.*\n\nAfter making several of these programs, I've notice various \"categories\" of program complexity. Programs can be of zero or more of these categories:\n\n* Absolute beginner level. *No functions, no nested data structures, avoid nested loops. Just uses simple branching and loops.*\n* Choose-your-own-adventure level. *Programs don't model things with data structures, but rather mostly use flow control.*\n* STDIO-only. *You can't undo things that have been previously printed (aside from \"printing\" backspace characters to erase characters on the current line). The output is like an append-only log file.*\n* Curses-like. *Requires the `bext` module, but can clear/refresh the screen, draw at arbitrary places on the screen in color, etc.*\n* Modify source code to run. *Instead of getting input from `input()`, the user edits variables at the top of the file to change the settings in the program.*\n\n\nAdditional modules I recommend using:\n\n* `bext` for colorful text and controlling the positioning of the text cursor.\n* `blessings` for a better version of curses.\n* `pyperclip` for copying/pasting text with the clipboard.\n* `playsound` for playing audio files.\n* `pyttsx3` for text to speech.\n* `pytextcavas` for 2D strings you can draw on\n* `pyrect` for rectangle data structure\n* `pybresenham` for various line-drawing functions\n\n\nCompleted Programs in This Collection\n=====================================\n\n*Alphabetize Quiz* - A time-based quiz game to see how fast you can alphabetize letters.\n\n*Alphabetize Word Quiz* - A time-based quiz game to see how fast you can alphabetize words.\n\n*Analog Clock* - An analog clock animation.

  "readme_contents": "# SteelSeries GameSense\u2122 SDK #\nGameSense\u2122 is a framework in SteelSeries Engine that allows games & apps\nto send status updates to Engine, which can then drive illumination,\nhaptic & OLED display capabilities of SteelSeries devices. One simple\nexample would be displaying the player's health on the row of\nfunctions keys as a bargraph that gets shorter and changes from green\nto red as their health decreases -- even flashing when it gets\ncritically low.\n\nThis repository contains documentation, tutorials, and examples for\ndevelopers wishing to support GameSense\u2122 in their games or\napplications.\n\n## Documentation ##\n\n### Getting Started\n[**How a game can register and send events to GameSense\u2122**](https://github.com/SteelSeries/gamesense-sdk/blob/master/doc/api/sending-game-events.md).\n\n[**How to specify event handlers in JSON from a game**](https://github.com/SteelSeries/gamesense-sdk/blob/master/doc/api/writing-handlers-in-json.md), for an out-of-the-box user customizable experience.\n\n[**How to control device illumination**](https://github.com/SteelSeries/gamesense-sdk/blob/master/doc/api/json-handlers-color.md)\n\n[**How to write full-keyboard lighting effects**](https://github.com/SteelSeries/gamesense-sdk/blob/master/doc/api/json-handlers-full-keyboard-lighting.md)\n\n[**How to control OLED screens**](https://github.com/SteelSeries/gamesense-sdk/blob/master/doc/api/json-handlers-screen.md)\n\n[**How to control tactile feedback**](https://github.com/SteelSeries/gamesense-sdk/blob/master/doc/api/json-handlers-tactile.md)\n\n[**How to add support for Moments**](https://github.com/SteelSeries/gamesense-sdk/blob/master/doc/api/sending-moments-events.md)\n\n\n### GoLisp Handlers\n[**How to write handlers in GoLisp**](https://github.com/SteelSeries/gamesense-sdk/blob/master/doc/api/writing-handlers-in-golisp.md), for the ultimate flexibility and power.\n\n### Reference\n[**List of standard zones that can be used in handlers**](https://github.com/SteelSeries/gamesense-sdk/blob/master/doc/api/standard-zones.md)\n\n[**List of event icons that can be used with OLED screen handlers**](https://github.com/SteelSeries/gamesense-sdk/blob/master/doc/api/event-icons.md)\n\n\n## Tutorials ##\n[**Turn an RGB device into an audio spectrum analyzer**](https://github.com/SteelSeries/gamesense-sdk/blob/master/doc/tutorials/audiovisualizer_tutorial.md), using the GoLisp handlers\n\n[**Writing a mod for MineCraft to support GameSense\u2122**](https://github.com/SteelSeries/gamesense-sdk/blob/master/doc/tutorials/minecraft-meet-sse.md)\n\n[**Writing a mod for MineCraft to support GameSense\u2122, Part 2**](https://github.com/SteelSeries/gamesense-sdk/blob/master/doc/tutorials/minecraft-meet-sse-part2.md), writing advanced handlers to work with the events being sent from the mod presented in part 1.\n\n[**Support tutorial on modding MineCraft**](https://github.com/SteelSeries/gamesense-sdk/blob/master/doc/tutorials/creating-a-minecraft-mod.md)\n\n[**Customizing built-in CS:GO event handling with GoLisp**](https://github.com/SteelSeries/gamesense-sdk/blob/master/doc/tutorials/csgo-customization-with-golisp.md), read (https://github.com/SteelSeries/gamesense-sdk/blob/master/doc/api/writing-handlers-in-golisp.md) first.\n\n## Sample Code ##\n\n[**`examples/audiovisualizer`**](https://github.com/SteelSeries/gamesense-sdk/tree/master/examples/audiovisualizer)\nCode to go with `doc/tutorials/audiovisualizer_tutorial.md`.\n\n[**`examples/minecraftforge1.8`**](https://github.com/SteelSeries/gamesense-sdk/tree/master/examples/minecraftforge1.8)\nCode for the [GameSense\u2122 Minecraft mod](http://www.technicpack.net/modpack/steelseries-gamesensetm.675193)\n\n## Submitting a game or app for approval ##\n### You actually don't need to submit anything to us.\nFeel free to release your own app, and anyone who has your game/app installed should see it appear as a GameSense App inside of SteelSeries Engine.  We want smaller devs to be able to develop their implementation completely on their own if they so choose.\n\n### Want to partner up and have a full curated experience for our mutual users?\nGreat, we do too.  [Contact us through this form](https://steelseries.com/developer/contact-us) and we'll get back to you right away.  We can add images, text, links, and other info about your project.  We can also help you with implementation, answer questions, and a lot more.\n\n#### Project info we'll ask for:\n* **Game/app title**\n* **Name of your organization/company**\n* **Link text & URL**\n* **Short description**: for App tile, cannot exceed 200 characters\n* **App tile image**: 330 pixels x 200 pixels as a PNG, containing your logo with a solid background\n* **GameSense customization page image**: 200 pixels x 50 pixels as a PNG, containing your logo with a fully transparent background\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Overview\n\n**Effect Games** provides a suite of developer tools for creating and publishing web-based video games.  The software is free, and includes an asset manager, level editor, sprite manager, environment editor, and publishing tools.  The source code is released under the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).\n\nAt the core of Effect Games is the *Effect Engine*, a JavaScript game engine which uses built-in browser technologies to render graphics.  Currently the engine uses classic DHTML, not the Canvas element nor WebGL.  For audio we use HTML5 whenever we can, but fall back to Flash where necessary (which is unfortunately a lot of the time).  The Effect Engine supports most browsers including Internet Explorer 6+, Firefox 3+, Safari 3+, Chrome 2+, Opera 9+, and all major platforms including Windows, Mac and Linux.\n\nThe Effect Engine was developed by [Joseph Huckaby](http://about.me/jhuckaby) in 2005.  He was dissatisfied with existing web game technologies that relied on 3rd party plugins, and set out to create a pure JavaScript game engine that would run in any browser.  A designer by training, [Min Chang](http://itsmin.com) provided a necessary creative perspective to the development and use of Effect Game's tools.  They are currently working on their next venture over at [GoldCartridge.com](http://www.goldcartridge.com).\n\n# Installation\n\nPlease see our [Installation Guide](https://github.com/jhuckaby/Effect-Games/wiki/Installation-Guide).\n\n# Legal\n\n**Effect Games Engine and IDE v1.0**\n\nCopyright (c) 2005 - 2011 Joseph Huckaby\n\nSource Code released under the MIT License: http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php\n\nPlease observe the folllowing additional licenses from software or media that the Effect Games IDE relies on, and ships with.

file, commit and create a Pull Request.\n\nRemember to include:\n\n* working link (and its nicer version), e.g. `[immunology-fps.edu](https://immunology-fps.edu)`\n* field of science or engineering, e.g. `immunology`\n* type of game `first-person shooter`\n* (optional) technology or system, e.g. `Android, iOS, web`\n* (optional) link to additional materials (e.g. repo, some interesting blog post about this game)\n\nA game needs to fit this category and it needs to have science-based mechanics (not only theme!) as its major part as:\n\n> Any sufficiently advanced game is indistinguishable from a science-based game. - [PM, HN comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14662356)\n\nAlso, for games from typical genres, the bar is much higher. It is not enough that \"you learn about ancient warfare\" or \"you explore outer space\".\nAs a rule of thumb, mainstream games don't fit here (with the exception of Kerbal Space Program).\n\nWhen a game is free ([as in freedom, not price](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)), the license and code repository will be stated when possible. Please note that unless otherwise stated, the game is proprietary *or* a license can't be found.\n\n#### Form\n\nIf you want to change its form, you are invited as well - but then create your fork (and I would be happy to hear about it!).\n\nAll remarks, questions or discussions go to https://github.com/stared/science-based-games-list/issues/ (or [@pmigdal Twitter](https://twitter.com/pmigdal)).\n\n### Ideas\n\n* Do it in YAML? (To make it more semantic.)\n* Make it more visual? (In the line of https://github.com/EliotAndres/kaggle-past-solutions.)\n* Add other fields like release date or dev status?\n* Add some standardized (600x400?) screenshots?\n"

This subpackage contains code that will run on both the server or browser and can be used\nas a building block for alternative UIs or applications.\n\n### Installation\n\n```sh\n$ npm install @smogon/calc\n```\n\nAlternatively, as [detailed below](#browser), if you are using `@smogon/calc` in the browser and want\na convenient way to get started, simply depend on a transpiled and minified version via [unpkg][5]:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/@smogon/calc/dist/data/production.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/@smogon/calc\"></script>\n```\n\n*In this example, the `@smogon/calc/data` code is included as well to fulfill the calc's data\nlayer requirement. Alternatively, a more fully-featured data layer such as [`@pkmn/data`][9] may\nbe used instead, see below.*\n\n### Usage\n\n`@smogon/calc` exports all of the data types required to perform a calculation. The `calculate`\nmethods require:\n\n- a `Generation` that contains information about which damage formula mechanics to apply and where\n  all of the data about the generation can be found.\n- attacker and defender `Pokemon` (note: only relevant attributes are required, everything else\n  should have sensible defaults). The `Pokemon` constructor also requires a `Generation` to provide\n  the Pok\u00e9mon's data for the generation.\n- the `Move` being used by the attacker (which also requires a `Generation` argument to scope the\n  move data to the particular generation).\n- (optionally) a `Field` object containing information about the state of each `Side`.\n\n`calculate` returns a `Result` object that contains methods for fetching damage rolls, ranges,\ndescriptions, recoil/drain information, etc.\n\n```ts\nimport {calculate, Generations, Pokemon, Move} from '@smogon/calc';\n\nconst gen = Generations.get(5); // alternatively: const gen = 5;\nconst result = calculate(\n  gen,\n  new Pokemon(gen, 'Gengar', {\n    item: 'Choice Specs',\n    nature: 'Timid',\n    evs: {spa: 252},\n    boosts: {spa: 1},\n  }),\n  new Pokemon(gen, 'Chansey', {\n    item: 'Eviolite',\n    nature: 'Calm',\n    evs: {hp: 252, spd: 252},\n  }),\n  new Move(gen, 'Focus Blast')\n);\n```\n\n`@smogon/calc` comes packaged with all of the data required for damage calculation - by default, it\nexposes this via its `Generations` object from `@smogon/calc/data`. As a shortcut, the `Generation`\nargument required by `calculate`, `Pokemon`, `Move` can instead simply be the generation *number*\n(eg. `5`), and it will handle getting that generations `Generation` object behind the scenes from\nthe data layer it ships with.\n\n**The data in `calc/data` must be kept in sync with Pok\u00e9mon Showdown. If there is an issue with the\ncalc's data, please fix it in the simulator first.** In general, you should probably not be\nmaking manual edits to any of the data files, and in the future, they are likely to be generated\nprogrammatically.\n\nIn some advanced use cases, you may wish to use a different data layer with the calculator. The\n`@smogon/calc/adaptable` entry point can be used with any data layer that implements the calc's\n`Generations` interface. This interface is a subset of [`@pkmn/data`][9]'s `Generations` interface,\nso `@pkmn/data` (which contains all competitively relevant data from Pok\u00e9mon Showdown) can be used\nwith the adaptable entry point for applications which want to avoid having two separate sets of the\nsame data shipped to users.\n\n```ts\nimport {Generations} from '@pkmn/data';\nimport {calculate, Pokemon, Move, Field} from '@smogon/calc/adaptable';\n\nconst gen = Generations.get(1);\nconst result = calculate(\n  new Pokemon(gen, 'Gengar'),\n  new Pokemon(gen, 'Vulpix'),\n  new Move(gen, 'Surf'),\n  new Field({defenderSide: {isLightScreen: true}})\n);\n```\n\n### Browser\n\nThe recommended way of using `@smogon/calc` in a web browser is to **configure your bundler**\n([Webpack][6], [Rollup][7], [Parcel][8], etc) to minimize it and package it with the rest of your\napplication. If you do not use a bundler, a convenience `production.min.js` is included in the\npackage. You simply need to depend on `./node_modules/@smogon/calc/production.min.js` in a `script`\ntag (which is what the unpkg shortcut above is doing), after which **`calc` will be\naccessible as a global.** You must also have a `Generations` implementation provided, you can either\ndepend on the calculator's data layer by depending on\n`./node_modules/@smogon/calc/data/production.min.js` (or `@smogon/calc/data` via unpkg), or you can\nuse an alternative data layer such as [`@pkmn/data`][9]. You must load your data layer\n**before** loading the calc:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"./node_modules/@smogon/calc/data/production.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"./node_modules/@smogon/calc/production.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n## UI\n\nThe [UI layer][2] is currently is written in vanilla JavaScript and HTML. To view the UI locally you\nfirst must install dependencies by running `npm install` at the top level and without `calc/`. This\nshould create a `node_modules/` folder under both the root directory and under `calc/`:\n\n```sh\n$ npm install\n$ cd calc && npm install\n```\n\nNext, run `node build` from the root directory of your clone of this repository. This should\nrun `npm run compile` in the `calc/` subdirectory to compile the `@smogon/calc` package from\nTypeScript to JavaScript that can be run in the browser, and then compile the 'templated' HTML\nand copy everything into the top-level `dist/` folder. To then view the UI, open `dist/index.html` -\nsimply double-clicking on the file from your operating system's file manager UI should open it in\nyour default browser.\n\n```sh\n$ node build\n$ open dist/index.html # open works on macOS, simply double-clicking the file on Windows/macOS works\n```\n\n**If you make changes to anything in `calc/`, you must run `node build` from the top level to\ncompile the files and copy them into `dist/` again. If you make changes to the HTML or JavaScript in\n`src/`you must run `node build view` before the changes will become visible in your browser**\n(`node build` also works, but it is slower, as it will compile `calc/` as well, which is\nunnecessary if you did not make any changes to that directory).\n\nBefore opening up a Pull Request, please ensure `npm test` passes:\n\n```sh\n$ npm test\n```\n\n### Import\n\nThis repository also houses an internal package under `import/` which is used for populating the\nPok\u00e9mon sets data (as well as data about random battle options) used by the UI. Before making\nchanges here you must run `npm install` from under the `import/` directory to install its\ndependencies as they are not installed by default. [`TASKS.md`][4] contains more information on\nhow to programmatically update sets.\n\n## Credits\n\nThis project was created by Honko and is primarily maintained by Austin.\n\n- Gens 1-6 were originally implemented by Honko.\n- The Omega Ruby / Alpha Sapphire update was done by gamut-was-taken and Austin.\n- The Gen 7 update was done by Austin.\n- The Gen 8 update was done by Austin and Kris.\n- Some CSS styling was contributed by Zarel to match the Pok\u00e9mon Showdown! theme.\n\nMany other contributors have added features or contributed bug fixes, please see the\n[full list of contributors](https://github.com/smogon/damage-calc/graphs/contributors).\n\n## License\n\nThis package is distributed under the terms of the [MIT License][3].\n\n  [0]: https://github.com/smogon/damage-calc\n  [1]: https://github.com/smogon/damage-calc/tree/master/calc\n  [2]: https://github.com/smogon/damage-calc/tree/master/src\n  [3]: https://github.com/smogon/damage-calc/blob/master/LICENSE\n  [4]: https://github.com/smogon/damage-calc/blob/master/TASKS.md\n  [5]: https://unpkg.com/\n  [6]: https://webpack.js.org/\n  [7]: https://rollupjs.org/\n  [8]: https://parceljs.org/\n  [9]: https://github.com/pkmn/ps/blob/master/data\n"

  "readme_contents": "# C1GamesStarterKit\n\nWelcome to the C1 Terminal Starter Kit! The repository contains a collection of scripts and \nlanguage-specific starter algos, to help you start your journey to develop the ultimate algo.\n\nFor more details about competitions and the game itself please check out our\n[main site](https://terminal.c1games.com/rules).\n\n## Manual Play\n\nWe recommend you familiarize yourself with the game and its strategic elements, by playing manually,\nbefore you start your algo. Check out [the playground](https://terminal.c1games.com/playground).\n\n## Algo Development\n\nTo test your algo locally, you should use the test_algo_[OS] scripts in the scripts folder. Details on its use is documented in the README.md file in the scripts folder.\n\nFor programming documentation of language specific algos, see each language specific README.\nFor documentation of the game-config or the json format the engine uses to communicate the current game state, see json-docs.html\n\nFor advanced users you can install java and run the game engine locally. Java 10 or above is required: [Java Development Kit 10 or above](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk10-downloads-4416644.html).\n\nAll code provided in the starterkit is meant to be used as a starting point, and can be overwritten completely by more advanced players to improve performance or provide additional utility.\n\n## Windows Setup\n\nIf you are running Windows, you will need Windows PowerShell installed. This comes pre-installed on Windows 10.\nSome windows users might need to run the following PowerShell commands in adminstrator mode (right-click the \nPowerShell icon, and click \"run as administrator\"):\n    \n    `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`\n    \nIf this doesn't work try this:\n    \n    `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted CurrentUser`\n    \nIf that still doesn't work, try these below:\n    \n    `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`\n    `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`\n    \nAnd don't forget to run the PowerShell as admin.\n\n## Uploading Algos\n\nSimply select the folder of your algo when prompted on the [Terminal](https://terminal.c1games.com) website. Make sure to select the specific language folder such as \"python-algo\" do not select the entire starterkit itself.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nFor detailed troubleshooting help related to both website problems and local development check out [the troubleshooting section](https://terminal.c1games.com/rules#Troubleshooting).\n\n#### Python Requirements\n\nPython algos require Python 3 to run. If you are running Unix (Mac OS or Linux), the command `python3` must run on \nBash or Terminal. If you are running Windows, the command `py -3` must run on PowerShell.\n   \n#### Java Requirements\n\nJava algos require the Java Development Kit. Java algos also require [Gradle]\n(https://gradle.org/install/) for compilation.\n   \n## Running Algos\n\nTo run your algo locally or on our servers, or to enroll your algo in a competition, please see the [documentation \nfor the Terminal command line interface in the scripts directory](https://github.com/correlation-one/AIGamesStarterKit/tree/master/scripts)\n"

Have a look at the [documentation](https://heroiclabs.com/docs) and join the [developer community](https://forum.heroiclabs.com) for more info.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThe server is simple to setup and run for local development and can be deployed to any cloud provider. See the [deployment notes](#deployment) for recommendations on how to deploy the project for production. Nakama server requires CockroachDB or another Postgres wire-compatible server as it's database.\n\n### Docker\n\n<a href=\"https://heroiclabs.com/docs/install-docker-quickstart/\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Docker_%28container_engine%29_logo.png\" width=\"170\"></a>\n\nThe fastest way to run the server and the database is with Docker. Setup Docker and start the daemon.\n\n1. Set up a [docker-compose file](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/install-docker-quickstart/#using-docker-compose) and place it in a folder for your project.\n\n2. Run `docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml up` to download container images and run the servers.\n\nFor more detailed instructions have a look at our [Docker quickstart](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/install-docker-quickstart) guide.\n\nNakama Docker images are maintained on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/heroiclabs/nakama/tags) and [prerelease](https://hub.docker.com/r/heroiclabs/nakama-prerelease/tags) images are occasionally published for cutting edge features of the server.\n\n### Binaries\n\nYou can run the servers with native binaries for your platform.\n\n1. Download the server from our [releases](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama/releases) page and the [database](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/install-cockroachdb.html).\n\n2. Follow the database [instructions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/start-a-local-cluster.html#before-you-begin) to start it.\n\n3. Run a migration which will setup or upgrade the database schema:\n\n   ```shell\n   nakama migrate up --database.address \"root@127.0.0.1:26257\"\n   ```\n\n4. Start Nakama and connect to the database:\n\n   ```shell\n   nakama --database.address \"root@127.0.0.1:26257\"\n   ```\n\nWhen connected you'll see server output which describes all settings the server uses for [configuration](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/install-configuration).\n\n> {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2018-04-29T10:14:41.249+0100\",\"msg\":\"Node\",\"name\":\"nakama\",\"version\":\"2.0.0+7e18b09\",\"runtime\":\"go1.10.1\",\"cpu\":4} <br/>\n> {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2018-04-29T10:14:41.249+0100\",\"msg\":\"Database connections\",\"dsns\":[\"root@127.0.0.1:26257\"]} <br/>\n> ...\n\n## Usage\n\nNakama supports a variety of protocols optimized for various gameplay or app use cases. For request/response it can use GRPC or the HTTP1.1+JSON fallback (REST). For realtime communication you can use WebSockets or rUDP.\n\nFor example with the REST API to authenticate a user account with a device identifier.\n\n```shell\ncurl \"127.0.0.1:7350/v2/account/authenticate/device?create=true\" \\\n  --user \"defaultkey:\" \\\n  --data '{\"id\": \"someuniqueidentifier\"}'\n```\n\nResponse:\n\n> { <br>\n>     \"token\":\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE1MjQ5OTU2NDksInVpZCI6Ijk5Y2Q1YzUyLWE5ODgtNGI2NC04YThhLTVmMTM5YTg4MTgxMiIsInVzbiI6InhBb1RxTUVSdFgifQ.-3_rXNYx3Q4jKuS7RkxeMWBzMNAm0vl93QxzRI8p_IY\" <br>\n> }\n\nThere's a number of official [client libraries](https://github.com/heroiclabs) available on GitHub with [documentation](https://heroiclabs.com/docs). The current platform/language support includes: .NET (in C#), Unity engine, JavaScript, Java (with Android), Unreal engine, Godot, Defold, and Swift (with iOS). If you'd like to contribute a client or request one let us know.\n\n## Nakama Console\n\nThe server provides a web UI which teams can use to inspect various data stored through the server APIs, view lightweight service metrics, manage player data, update storage objects, restrict access to production with permission profiles, and gain visibility into realtime features like active multiplayer matches. There is no separate installation required as it is embedded as part of the single server binary.\n\nYou can navigate to it on your browser on [http://127.0.0.1:7351](http://127.0.0.1:7351).\n\n<img src=\".github/accounts.jpg?raw=true\" title=\"Account listing\" width=\"1024\" align=\"center\">\n<img src=\".github/status.jpg?raw=true\" title=\"Status view\" width=\"125\" align=\"left\">\n<img src=\".github/storage.jpg?raw=true\" title=\"Storage record view\" width=\"125\" align=\"left\">\n<img src=\".github/match.jpg?raw=true\" title=\"Running matches view\" width=\"125\" align=\"left\">\n<img src=\".github/users.jpg?raw=true\" title=\"Console users view\" width=\"125\" align=\"left\">\n<img src=\".github/modules.jpg?raw=true\" title=\"Loaded modules view\" width=\"125\">\n\n## Deployment\n\nNakama can be deployed to any cloud provider such as Google Cloud, Azure, AWS, Digital Ocean, Heroku, or your own private cloud. You should setup and provision separate nodes for Nakama and CockroachDB.\n\nThe recommended minimum production infrastructure for CockroachDB is outlined in [these docs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/recommended-production-settings.html#basic-hardware-recommendations) and Nakama can be run on instance types as small as \"g1-small\" on Google Cloud although we recommend a minimum of \"n1-standard-1\" in production. The specific hardware requirements will depend on what features of the server are used. Reach out to us for help and advice on what servers to run.\n\n### Heroic Cloud\n\nYou can support development, new features, and maintainance of the server by using the Heroic Labs' [Heroic Cloud](https://heroiclabs.com/heroic-cloud/) for deployment. This service handles the uptime, replication, backups, logs, data upgrades, and all other tasks involved with production server environments.\n\nHave a look at our [Heroic Cloud](https://heroiclabs.com/heroic-cloud/) service for more details.\n\n## Contribute\n\nThe development roadmap is managed as GitHub issues and pull requests are welcome. If you're interested to add a feature which is not mentioned on the issue tracker please open one to create a discussion or drop in and discuss it in the [community forum](https://forum.heroiclabs.com).\n\n### Simple Builds\n\nAll dependencies required for a build are vendored as part of the Go project. We recommend a modern release of the Go toolchain and do not store the codebase in the old GOPATH.\n\n1. Download the source tree.\n\n   ```shell\n   git clone \"https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama\" nakama\n   cd nakama\n   ```\n\n2. Build the project from source.\n\n   ```shell\n   go build -trimpath -mod=vendor\n   ./nakama --version\n   ```\n\n### Full Source Builds\n\nThe codebase uses Protocol Buffers, GRPC, GRPC-Gateway, and the OpenAPI spec as part of the project. These dependencies are generated as sources and committed to the repository to simplify builds for contributors.\n\nTo build the codebase and generate all sources follow these steps.\n\n1. Install the toolchain.\n\n   ```shell\n   go install \\\n       \"google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go\" \\\n       \"google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc\" \\\n       \"github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway\" \\\n       \"github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2\"\n   ```\n\n2. If you've made changes to the embedded Console.\n\n    ```shell\n    cd console/ui\n    ng serve\n    ```\n\n3. Re-generate the protocol buffers, gateway code and console UI.\n\n   ```shell\n   env PATH=\"$HOME/go/bin:$PATH\" go generate -x ./...\n   ```\n\n4. Build the codebase.\n\n   ```shell\n   go build -trimpath -mod=vendor\n   ```\n\n### License\n\nThis project is licensed under the [Apache-2 License](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama/blob/master/LICENSE).\n"

It is designed to let\ndevelopers express their applications in task parallelism and let the scheduling framework\nmaximize the physical parallelism on the available processors.\n\n### Key Goals\n\n* **Simple expression of task parallelism**\n* **Highly efficient scheduling**\n* **Easy to configure and extend**\n\n### Target Audience\n\nGTS is designed for the needs of current and future game engine developers. Typical engine developers employ a highly\ncustomized, platform-scalable task system (or job system) that provides dedicated worker threads\nexecuting thousands of concurrent tasks. These threads may also share resources with driver,\nnetworking, middleware, and video streaming threads, all working in synchronized concert to \ndeliver glitch-free real-time rendering on 60+ frames per second (FPS) applications. Future game\nengines will have to cope with more threads, more tasks, and potentially multiple\ninstruction-set-architectures (ISAs), all running on an ever-expanding hardware landscape. \n\nWe built GTS to be simple and friendly to game engine task system use cases. We want a framework\nthat allows the game development community to experiment with and learn from different scheduling\nalgorithms easily. We also want a framework that allows us to demonstrate state-of-the-art algorithms\non task scheduling. Finally, we want to encourage games to better express parallelism so they can\ncompute more cool stuff and enable richer PC gaming experiences!\n\n### Features\n\n* Easily integrate GTS into an existing game engine complete with low level platform \noverrides. Game engines support a wide variety of operating systems and hardware platforms,\nwith varying degrees of custom code and work-arounds. Since GTS cannot possibly\nsupport every work-around and corner case, we have simplified engine integration\nby allowing the developer to completely replace the GTS platform layer through\na configuration file (user_config.h). \n* Express high-level program flow with persistent, dynamic task DAGs that can be\nexecuted homogeneously or heterogeneously with the Macro-Scheduler\n* Jump right into parallelism with predefined Parallel Patterns\n* Easily communicate between threads with Parallel Containers\n* Carve up CPU resources as you see fit with the WorkerPool\n* Express low-level algorithms and highly efficient execution policies with the Micro-scheduler\nand Task constructs.\n* Remove bottlenecks around heap access with gts_malloc.\n* Avoid contention and kernel-mode synchronization with GTS's user-mode synchronization primitives and contention \nreducing constructs.\n* OS-header-free and mostly STL-free interface. GTS won't pollute your engine with unnecessary headers.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n"

Lucky Doge [generously provided the results that he had made a lot of hard work](https://github.com/FurryGamesIndex/games/blob/master/luckydoge.txt), making it possible for this project to quickly develop into a practical list. The project pays more attention to maintainability, encourages community participation, provides convenient infrastructure for community participation and improves ease of use (such as tagging and search functions), and may also do voting and discussion in the future.\n\nIn this project, each game is structured in a independent YAML file. YAML is very easy to edit by furries and humans, and then it is automatically rendered into HTML versions in multiple languages by python scripts.\n\n[Build guide](https://github.com/FurryGamesIndex/games/blob/master/BUILD.md)\n\n## Get Involved\n\n[Get Involved in FurryGamesIndex](doc/Get-Involved.en.md)\n\n## Copyright Information\n\nAll game data and documents (files in `games/`, `doc/` (but excludes auto-generated `doc/spec` directory)) are shared in [Creative Common Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license.

  "readme_contents": "\nPutting game servers in Docker containers. Because it makes life easier.\n\nA set of game servers that have been wrapped with Docker. All images are\ncomposed of other images in this repository, except for base. Most images\nwill auto-download any dependencies they have (eg, factorio server files\nor sourcemod for srcds), making it almost one command to install a server.\nNo binaries are stored in this repo, so make sure you have internet to\ndownload them with.\n\nIncludes a utility script `start_server.sh` which mounts save data to an\nexternal volume and sorts out networking for you.\n\n## Quick start\n\nAssuming you are on a blank server with Git and docker installed:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/OpenSourceLAN/gameservers-docker.git .\n./build.sh factorio\n\n./start_server.sh factorio\n# Or\ndocker run -it --net=host -e \"SERVER_NAME=Some really cool server\"\\\n-v `pwd`/save:`cat factorio/mounts` --name factorio factorio\n\n```\n\nMost servers have environment variables that can be used to configure them.\nRead the README.md file in each directory to see what is available.\n\n## Tutorial\n\nThere is a [tutorial on the Open Source LAN website](http://opensourcelan.com/blog/2017/01/28/containing-your-game-servers/)\nwhich will step you through building and using the images.\n\n## Contributions \nContributions are welcome. Submit a pull request or open an issue. \n\nAll additions should follow these suggestions:\n* Set up for LAN by default - eg, call +sv_lan 1 in srcds games, but optionally disabling that by runtime var is fine\n* Include a start script that is added to the container, so anyone using the Dockerfile can easily customise their server\n\n\n## Advanced networking stuff\n\nWe want to expose all game servers directly to our LAN, and the `--host` option\nmeans we will get port conflicts. There is an alternative approach which uses\nthe ipvlan or macvlan docker network driver.\n\n```\n# Creates a docker network that's bridge with your layer 2 network\n# Subnet should match the IP range and subnet of your network.\n# ip-range is the CIDR block of IP addresses to assign to containers\n# parent is the name of the interface you'd like to bridge containers to\n\ndocker network create --driver ipvlan --subnet=10.0.0.0/24 -o parent=eth0 --ip-range 10.0.0.16/28 --gateway 10.0.0.1  gameservers\n\n# If the above command doesn't work, try using macvlan instead of ipvlan\n\n# Starts your game server inside the layer 2 network\ndocker run -it --rm --net=gameservers csgo /steam/csgo/srcds_run -game csgo +sv_lan 1 +map cs_office\n```\n\nYou can now see the CSGO server from another server on your network.\n\n\n## Running game servers on Docker Swarm\n\n[These are the instructions for building a swarm](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/install-manual/).\n\nIn addition to the swarm, one also needs a docker registry (I think). \n\nThese are the following gotchas that you need to be aware of:\n\n* If using ipvlan, you need _experimental_, not main release docker (as at version 1.12)\n* The ipvlan network is local scoped. This means you need to create the network on every\nhost individually. You should ensure the assigned IP ranges for each host do not overlap,\nas there does not appear to be any shared state about IP addresses assigned. The name of\nthe networks should be identical on every host.\n* The tutorial only has you set up a single consul instance. It will change IP addresses\nevery time the container restarts, and this will cause consul to fail because it cannot\nelect itself leader, since it thinks another instance exists at a different IP address.\nMake sure to hard code an IP for it.\n* Using ubuntu 14.04, you'll need to update `/etc/defaults/docker` to contain: `DOCKER_OPTS=\"-H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock\"`\n* If not using a secured docker registry, also add to the `DOCKER_OPTS` value: `--insecure-registry=registry-hostname:5000`\n* Consul, docker node and docker masters can all be on the same host (I think - it works for me at least)\n* To get a container to failover between hosts in the case of an outage, you need to run the container with these args: ` -e reschedule:on-node-failure`\n(todo: figure out why the container doesn't get auto-started on the new host).\nAlso note that a race condition exists - when the host comes back up, it will start the old container, and when \nthe docker swarm manager container starts, it will detect the container was moved and kill it.\n\n### Setting up multiple consul hosts\n\nRun the master like this:\n\n```\ndocker run -d  -v /mnt:/data --name consul \\\n    -p 8300:8300 \\\n    -p 8301:8301 \\\n    -p 8301:8301/udp \\\n    -p 8302:8302 \\\n    -p 8302:8302/udp \\\n    -p 8400:8400 \\\n    -p 8500:8500 \\\n    -p 53:53/udp \\\n    progrium/consul -server -advertise 10.0.0.167 -bootstrap-expect 3\n```\n\nand the other two like this:\n```\n    docker run -d -v /mnt:/data --name consul \\\n    -p 8300:8300 \\\n    -p 8301:8301 \\\n    -p 8301:8301/udp \\\n    -p 8302:8302 \\\n    -p 8302:8302/udp \\\n    -p 8400:8400 \\\n    -p 8500:8500 \\\n    -p 53:53/udp \\\n    progrium/consul -server -advertise 10.0.0.197 -join 10.0.0.167\n```\n\nDouble check all 3 are present in cluster by doing `curl http://localhost:8500/v1/status/peers`.\n\n\n### TODO\n\nEnsure every instance has:\n\n* A README covering available options, startup scripts, etc\n* Auto-mount point support where appropriate (eg, for saves, demos)\n* Config options for at least:\n  * The name of the server (what it shows as in server browsers)\n  * Server password\n  * RCON password (where RCON exists)\n  * LAN or internet\n* Has dockerfile configured with default ports it exposes (not that the suggested configuration uses these)\n* Has a way to easily RCON or remote control\n* Does not require user to manually download everything (with exceptions for some large and customisable downloads)\n* Fix the thing where the auto mounts always have permission problems because conatiners\n\nMake the easy start script support passing environment variables to the container\n\nMake an easy way to import config files in to the servers (eg mounting cfg directories)\n\nAdd more games\n\n### LICENSE\n\nThis project is licensed under GPL 3.0.

SSDs can be thought of as analogous to spatially and temporally extended Prisoner's Dilemma-like games. The reward structure poses a dilemma because individual short-term optimal strategies lead to poor long-term outcomes for the group.\n\nThe implemented environments are structured to be compatible with [OpenAIs gym environments](https://github.com/openai/gym) as well as [RLlib's Multiagent Environment](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/env/multi_agent_env.py)\n\n## Implemented Games\n\n* **Cleanup**: A public goods dilemma in which agents get a reward for consuming apples, but must use a cleaning beam to clean a river in order for apples to grow. While an agent is cleaning the river, other agents can exploit it by consuming the apples that appear.\n\n<img src=\"images/cleanup.png\" alt=\"Image of the cleanup game\" width=\"170\" height=\"246\"/>\n\n* **Harvest**: A tragedy-of-the-commons dilemma in which apples regrow at a rate that depends on the amount of nearby apples. If individual agents employ an exploitative strategy by greedily consuming too many apples, the collective reward of all agents is reduced.\n\n<img src=\"images/harvest.png\" alt=\"Image of the Harvest game\" width=\"483\" height=\"187\"/>\n\n<img src=\"images/schelling.png\" alt=\"Schelling diagrams for Harvest and Cleanup\" width=\"953\" height=\"352\"/>\n\nThe above plot shows the empirical Schelling diagrams for both Cleanup (A) and Harvest (B) (from [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08884)). These diagrams show the payoff that an individual agent can expect if it follows a defecting/exploitative strategy (red) vs a cooperative strategy (blue), given the number of other agents that are cooperating.  We can see that an individual agent can almost always greedily benefit from detecting, but the more agents that defect, the worse the outcomes for all agents.  \n\n# Setup instructions\nTo install the SSD environments:\n### Anaconda/miniconda\n```\ngit clone -b master https://github.com/eugenevinitsky/sequential_social_dilemma_games\ncd sequential_social_dilemma_games\nconda create -n ssd python==3.8.10 # Create a conda virtual environment\n# Patch ray due to https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/7946\n# And https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/8491\n. conda_uint8_patch.sh\n```\n###\n```\ngit clone -b master https://github.com/eugenevinitsky/sequential_social_dilemma_games\ncd sequential_social_dilemma_games\npython3 -m venv venv # Create a Python virtual environment\n. venv/bin/activate\npip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel\npython3 setup.py develop\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\n# Patch ray due to https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/7946\n# And https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/8491\n. venv_uint8_patch.sh\n```\n\nTo install sb3|rllib|all requirements for learning:\n```\npip install social-dilemmas[sb3|rllib|all]\n```\n\nIf using RLlib:\n```\n\n```\n\nAfter the setup, you can run experiments like so:\n- To train with default parameters (baseline model cleanup with 2 agents):\n`python3 run_scripts/train.py`\n\n- To train the MOA with 5 agents:\n`python3 run_scripts/train.py --model moa --num_agents 5`\n\nMany more options are available which can be found in [default_args.py](config/default_args.py). A collection of preconfigured training scripts can be found in [run_scripts](run_scripts). \n\nNote that the RLlib initialization time can be rather high (up to 5 minutes) the more agents you use, and the more complex your used model is.\n\n- To train using [Stable-Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) and parameter shared PPO:\n`python3 run_scripts/sb3_train.py --env harvest --num_agents 5`\n\n- To train using [MARL-Baselines3](https://github.com/Rohan138/marl-baselines3) and independent PPO:\n`python3 run_scripts/sb3_independent.py --env harvest --num_agents 5`\n\n- To train using [MARL-Baselines3](https://github.com/Rohan138/marl-baselines3) and independent PPO with inequity aversion:\n- \n`python3 run_scripts/sb3_independent.py --env harvest --num_agents 5 --inequity-averse-reward=True --alpha=5.0 --beta=0.05`\n\n# CUDA, cuDNN and tensorflow-gpu\n\nIf you run into any cuda errors, make sure you've got a [compatible set](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#tested_build_configurations) of cuda/cudnn/tensorflow versions installed. However, beware of the following:\n>The compatibility table given in the tensorflow site does not contain specific minor versions for cuda and cuDNN. However, if the specific versions are not met, there will be an error when you try to use tensorflow. [source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53727997)\n\n# Tests\nTests are located in the test folder and can be run individually or run by running `python -m pytest`. Many of the less obviously defined rules for the games can be understood by reading the tests, each of which outline some aspect of the game. \n\n# Constructing new environments\nEvery environment that subclasses MapEnv probably needs to implement the following methods\n\n```\n    def custom_reset(self):\n        \"\"\"Reset custom elements of the map. For example, spawn apples\"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def custom_action(self, agent, action):\n        \"\"\"Execute any custom, non-move actions that may be defined, like fire or clean\"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def custom_map_update(self):\n        \"\"\"Custom map updates that don't have to do with agent actions\"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def setup_agents(self):\n        \"\"\"Construct all the agents for the environment\"\"\"\n        raise NotImplementedError\n```\n\n## PPO Results\n\nThe below graphs display results for cleanup/harvest using un-tuned PPO in RLlib. As of yet, A3C remains untested.\n\n**Collective cleanup reward**:\n\n<img src=\"images/cleanup_collective_reward.svg\" alt=\"Collective reward plot of cleanup\" width=\"460.8\" height=\"345.6\"/>\n\n**Collective harvest reward**:\n\n<img src=\"images/harvest_collective_reward.svg\" alt=\"Collective reward plot of harvest\" width=\"460.8\" height=\"345.6\"/>\n\n\n## Relevant papers\n\n1.

  "readme_contents": "ReShade\n=======\n\nThis is a generic post-processing injector for games and video software. It exposes an automated way to access both frame color and depth information and a custom shader language called ReShade FX to write effects like ambient occlusion, depth of field, color correction and more which work everywhere.\n\nReShade can optionally load **add-ons**, DLLs that make use of the ReShade API to extend functionality of both ReShade and/or the application ReShade is being applied to. To get started on how to write your own add-on, check out the [API reference](REFERENCE.md).\n\nThe ReShade FX shader compiler contained in this repository is standalone, so can be integrated into other projects as well. Simply add all `source/effect_*.*` files to your project and use it similar to the [fxc example](tools/fxc.cpp).\n\n## Building\n\nYou'll need Visual Studio 2017 or higher to build ReShade and Python for the `gl3w` dependency.\n\n1. Clone this repository including all Git submodules\n2. Open the Visual Studio solution\n3. Select either the `32-bit` or `64-bit` target platform and build the solution.\\\n   This will build ReShade and all dependencies. To build the setup tool, first build the `Release` configuration for both `32-bit` and `64-bit` targets and only afterwards build the `Release Setup` configuration (does not matter which target is selected then).\n\nA quick overview of what some of the source code files contain:\n\n|File                                                                  |Description                                                            |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|[dll_log.cpp](source/dll_log.cpp)                                     |Simple file logger implementation                                      |\n|[dll_main.cpp](source/dll_main.cpp)                                   |Main entry point (and optional test application)                       |\n|[dll_resources.cpp](source/dll_resources.cpp)                         |Access to DLL resource data (e.g. built-in shaders)                    |\n|[effect_lexer.cpp](source/effect_lexer.cpp)                           |Lexical analyzer for C-like languages                                  |\n|[effect_parser.cpp](source/effect_parser.cpp)                         |Parser for the ReShade FX shader language                              |\n|[effect_preprocessor.cpp](source/effect_preprocessor.cpp)             |C-like preprocessor implementation                                     |\n|[hook.cpp](source/hook.cpp)                                           |Wrapper around MinHook which tracks associated function pointers       |\n|[hook_manager.cpp](source/hook_manager.cpp)                           |Automatic hook installation based on DLL exports                       |\n|[input.cpp](source/input.cpp)                                         |Keyboard and mouse input management and window message queue hooks     |\n|[runtime.cpp](source/runtime.cpp)                                     |Core ReShade runtime including effect and preset management            |\n|[runtime_gui.cpp](source/runtime_gui.cpp)                             |Overlay rendering and everything user interface related                |\n\n## Contributing\n\nAny contributions to the project are welcomed, it's recommended to use GitHub [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).\n\n## Feedback and Support\n\nSee the [ReShade Forum](https://reshade.me/forum) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/PrwndfH) server for feedback and support.\n\n## License\n\nReShade is licensed under the terms of the [BSD 3-clause license](LICENSE.md).\\\nSome source code files are dual-licensed and are also available under the terms of the MIT license, when stated as such at the top of those files.\n"

You'll learn how to create python games with AI. I try to focus on creating board games without GUI in Jupyter-notebook.\n\n---\n\n## Table of contents \ud83d\udccb\n\n| **No.** | **Name** | \n| ------- | -------- | \n| 01 | **[Bulls and Cows with AI](https://github.com/milaan9/92_Python_Games/tree/main/001_Bulls_and_Cows_with_AI)** |\n| 02 | **[Tic-Tac-Toe with AI](https://github.com/milaan9/92_Python_Games/tree/main/002_Tic_Tac_Toe_with_AI)** |\n\n\nThese are online **read-only** versions. However you can **`Run \u25b6`**  all the codes **online** by clicking here \u279e <a href=\"https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/milaan9/92_Python_Games/HEAD\"><img src=\"https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg\" alt=\"binder\"/></a>\n\n---\n\n## Frequently asked questions \u2754\n\n### How can I thank you for writing and sharing this tutorial? \ud83c\udf37\n\nYou can <img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=%E2%AD%90 Star &message=if%20useful&style=style=flat&color=blue\" alt=\"Star Badge\"/> and <img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=%E2%B5%96 Fork &message=if%20useful&style=style=flat&color=blue\" alt=\"Fork Badge\"/> Starring and Forking is free for you, but it tells me and other people that it was helpful and you like this tutorial.\n\nGo [**`here`**](https://github.com/milaan9/92_Python_Games) if you aren't here already and click \u279e **`\u2730 Star`** and **`\u2d56 Fork`** button in the top right corner. You will be asked to create a GitHub account if you don't already have one.\n\n---\n\n### How can I read this tutorial without an Internet connection? <img alt=\"GIF\" src=\"https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/hmm.gif\" width=\"20\" />\n\n1. Go [**`here`**](https://github.com/milaan9/92_Python_Games) and click the big green \u279e **`Code`** button in the top right of the page, then click \u279e [**`Download ZIP`**](https://github.com/milaan9/92_Python_Games/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).\n\n    ![Download ZIP](img/dnld_rep.png) \n\n2. Extract the ZIP and open it. Unfortunately I don't have any more specific instructions because how exactly this is done depends on which operating system you run.\n    \n3. Launch ipython notebook from the folder which contains the notebooks. Open each one of them\n  \n    **`Kernel > Restart & Clear Output`**\n    \nThis will clear all the outputs and now you can understand each statement and learn interactively.\n\nIf you have git and you know how to use it, you can also clone the repository instead of downloading a zip and extracting it.

The `Stage` component does the same with game scale.\n\n### World\n\nIf you intend on using physics in your game, a good next component would be the `World` component, which creates and provides a physics engine & world:\n\n```js\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <Loop>\n      <Stage>\n        <World>\n          // Game specific components go here\n        </World>\n      </Stage>\n    </Loop>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Physics Bodies\n\nOnce you have a physics engine/world established, you can use the `Body` component to define physics bodies inline:\n\n```js\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <Loop>\n      <Stage>\n        <World>\n          <Body args={[0,0,75,75]} ref={ (b) => this.body = b.body }>\n            // Sprites go here\n          </Body>\n        </World>\n      </Stage>\n    </Loop>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nUsing a ref you can obtain a reference to the physics body and modify its properties via the [Matter-js API](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js).\n\n### Next Steps\n\nOnce this general structure is established, what follows usually depends on what kind of game you intend to make. Check out the API documentation below for further clarity regarding use of these components.\n\n## React Native\n\nUsing this library with React Native is a simple as importing from the native directory:\n\n```js\nimport { Loop, Stage, ...etc } from 'react-game-kit/native';\n```\n\n> Note: AudioPlayer and KeyListener are not implemented on the React Native version.\n\n## API\n\n#### \\<Loop />\n\nThe `Loop` component acts much like a Redux provider, in that it passes a GameLoop instance down the component tree via `this.context.loop`.\n\nThis allows you to subscribe and unsubscribe to the main game loop anywhere in your component tree. Here is an example of how this would generally look:\n\n```js\nclass ChildComponent extends React.Component {\n  static contextTypes = {\n    loop: PropTypes.object,\n  };\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.context.loop.subscribe(this.update);\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    this.context.loop.unsubscribe(this.update);\n  }\n\n  update() {\n    // tick logic\n  };\n}\n\n```\n\n--\n\n#### \\<Stage />\n\n**height** (_number_) : Base game height. Defaults to `576`.\n\n**width** (_number_) : Base game width. Defaults to `1024`.\n\nThe `Stage` component also leverages `context` much like `Loop`, except it passes game scale as `this.context.scale`. You can use this value to appropriately scale positioning and dimension values within your game. Again, you would have to specify `scale: PropTypes.number` in your component's `contextTypes` to receive this value.\n\n--\n\n#### \\<World />\n\n**gravity** (_object_) : World gravity object.\n\nDefaults:\n\n```js\ngravity={{\n  x: 0,\n  y: 1,\n  scale: 0.001,\n}}\n```\n\n**onCollision** (_func_) : World collision callback.\n\n**onInit** (_func_) : World init callback.\n\n**onUpdate** (_func_) : World update callback.\n\nThe `World` component is used as the first step in setting up game physics. It passes a `matter-js` Engine instance down via context as `this.context.engine`. Generally speaking, when getting or settings physics properties you'll want to do this after the physics world is updated in the main tick cycle. You can hook into this using the `onUpdate` prop, or in child components use `Matter.Events.on(this.context.engine, 'afterUpdate', this.update);` to subscribe to the engine updates.\n\nThe `onInit` callback is a great place to do your initial world setup, things like creating static bodies for walls and the floor.\n\n--\n\n#### \\<Body />\n\n**args** (_array_) : Initial body creation arguments. Depends on the `shape` prop, which maps to Matter.Bodies body creation methods detailed here: [Matter.Bodies Documentation](http://brm.io/matter-js/docs/classes/Bodies.html)\n\nAll other props on the body component map directly to [Matter-js Body properties](http://brm.io/matter-js/docs/classes/Body.html).\n\nThe `Body` component is used to define physics bodies. You will generally want to use `ref` to obtain a reference to the body, at which point you can call Matter-js methods on it, as well as listen to and react to its physic properties in the world update callback.\n\n--\n\n#### \\<Sprite />\n\n\n**offset** (array) : Sprite sheet x,y offset.\n\n**onPlayStateChanged** (func) : Sprite play state changed callback.\n\n**repeat** (bool) : Determines whether sprite animation should loop.\n\n**scale** (number) : Scale value for sprite image.\n\n**src** (string) : src path for sprite sheet.\n\n**state** (number) : Vertical position in sprite sheet.\n\n**steps** (array) : Number of animation steps for current row (state).\n\n**ticksPerFrame** (number) : Number of loop ticks per animation frame.\n\n**tileHeight** (number) : Height of spritesheet tile.\n\n**tileWidth** (number) : Width of spritesheet tile.\n\nThe `Sprite` component lets you define sprite animations using sprite sheets. When creating a sprite sheet, define sprite tile dimensions that will be provided via the `tileHeight` & `tileWidth` props. Next, each animation state is represented by a row, with steps of the animation represented as columns.\n\n--\n\n#### \\<TileMap />\n\n**columns** (number) : number of columns in tile map.\n\n**layers** (array) : Array of arrays that contain tile indexes.\n\n**renderTile** (func) : Overrideable tile rendering function.\n\n**rows** (number) : Number of rows in tile map.\n\n**scale** (number) : Tile map scale.\n\n**src** (string) : Tilemap image src path.\n\n**tileSize** (number) : Tilemap tile size.\n\n**width** (number) : Tilemap width.\n\n**height** (number) : Tilemap height.\n\nThe `TileMap` component lets you define tile maps from a tile atlas. Your tilemap is made of up rows and columns. Each layer is then drawn using those numbers as reference. So for example, if you had 4 rows and 4 columns, with 1 layer, your `layers` prop would look like:\n\n```js\nlayers={[\n  [\n    0, 0, 0, 0,\n    1, 0, 1, 1,\n    0, 0, 1, 0,\n    1, 0, 0, 0,\n  ]\n]}\n```\n\n--\n\n\n\n## License\n\n[MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\n## Maintenance Status\n\n**Archived:** This project is no longer maintained by Formidable.

  "readme_contents": "Source-1-Games\n==============\n\nThis is the README for the Source 1 based games.  Source 1 based games include Team Fortress 2, Left4Dead2, and Counter-Strike: Source.\n\nPlease use this repository to report bugs and feature requests for Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Source, Left4Dead2, and the Source 1 Engine.\n\nConduct\n-------\n\nThere are basic rules of conduct that should be followed at all times by everyone participating in the discussions.  While this is generally a relaxed environment, please remember the following:\n\n- Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.\n- Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.\n- Do not use ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.\n- Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists.\n\nRemember: Just because the issue you reported was reported here does not mean that it is an issue with Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Source or any other Source 1 game.  As well, should your issue not be resolved immediately, it does not mean that a resolution is not being researched or tested.  Patience is always appreciated.\n\nReporting Issues\n----------------\n\nIf you encounter a bug while using Source 1 games, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues) to see if it has already been reported. Include closed issues in your search.\n\nIf it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:\n\n- which game you're reporting the bug on (TF2, CS:S, all)\n- a short, descriptive title;\n- a detailed description of the issue, including any output from the command line;\n- steps for reproducing the issue; and\n- your [system information](#system-information).\n\nPlease place logs either in a code block ([go here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for a GFM cheat sheet) or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).\n\n### System information\n\nYour system information must include:\n- your Linux distro or OS version\n- your Desktop/Window Manager (Linux only)\n- your Graphics card info (manufacturer, card version), any and all graphics driver versions\n- anything else that you think may be useful (mouse/keyboard, filesystem type, etc).\n\nThe preferred and easiest way to get this information is from Steam's Hardware Information viewer from the menu (`Help -> System Information`).\n\nOnce your information appears: right-click within the dialog, choose `Select All`, right-click again, and then choose `Copy`.\nPaste this information into your report, preferably in a code block or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).\n\nFeature Requests\n-------------------\n\nIf you are asking for a new feature or enhancement for a game, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues) to see if it has already been asked for. Include closed issues in your search.\n\nIf it has been asked for, go ahead and put your 2 cents in for it in the existing entry.\n\nIf it has not been asked for, create a new issue with at least the following information:\n\n - The game your asking for the enhancement\n - A clear description of what exactly you want\n - Justification as to why this is something that is needed\n - Why we should do this feature rather than doing some other feature on the list\n\nRemember that just because you ask for a feature improvement doesn't mean we'll get to it.  We're mostly going to be focused on existing bugs rather than enhancing these games.  That being said, it does make a difference to know what you want here.  Be clear.  Be concise.\n\nDriver Contact Information\n--------------------------\n\nSome of the issue you may be experiencing are due to the various video drivers.  Here is an incomplete list of places that you might be able to file bugs or get additional help:\n\n### AMD\n\nAMD Steam Linux forum for reporting **compatibility and performance issues with AMD hardware**:\n\nhttps://community.amd.com/community/devgurus/steam-linux\n\nThe AMD Open Source driver is a part of Mesa, so use the links under \"Intel\" to report issues with it.\n\n### Intel\n\nFor discussions, there is the mesa-users email list:\n\nhttp://mesa3d.org/lists.html\n\nBugs and feature requests should be logged in bugzilla:\n\nhttp://mesa3d.org/bugs.html\n\n### NVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA supported drivers\n- https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/board/98\n\nOpen Source NVIDIA driver (nouveau)\n- http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/\n\nIf you know of any other places, please let us know.\n\nKnown Video Driver/Card issues:\n----------------------------------\n\n### NVIDIA\n\n6xxx and 7xxx hardware have been EOL'd. The code specific to these GPUs isn't even compiled into drivers anymore.\n\n6xxx and 7xxx GPUs are incapable of performing sRGB functionality needed by Source Engine titles when being driven by OpenGL. (The sRGB behavior as specified in OpenGL is slightly different than the behavior that was actually unspecified in D3D9, which is why this works in D3D9 but not in OpenGL).\n\n"

This demo app is my first adventure in Flutter and I have to say its been a blast!\n\n[![Screenshots](screenshots/demo.gif)](https://gallery.codelessly.com/flutterwebsites/fluttergames/?utm_medium=image&utm_campaign=preview)\n\n# Screenshots\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/searchy2/FlutterGames/master/screenshots/main_1_540x900.jpg\" width=\"360\"/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/searchy2/FlutterGames/master/screenshots/details_1_540x900.jpg\" width=\"360\"/>\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/searchy2/FlutterGames/master/screenshots/details_2_540x900.jpg\" width=\"360\"/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/searchy2/FlutterGames/master/screenshots/coming_soon_540x900.jpg\" width=\"360\"/>\n\n# Flutter is Amazing\n\nA quick list of what I found makes Flutter great:\n\n* **Views are code.** Much less boilerplate than having adapters, viewholders, and XML all over the place.\n* **Hero shared element transitions.** Just wrap shared elements in a Hero widget and give them the same tag to created a shared transition. No need to read 3 pages of documentation and write tightly coupled code :) This is truly mindblowing. \n* **Graceful image loading.** Flutter understands that visible images should be loaded first. The way Flutter does image loading in a List is just so beautiful!\n* **Highly customizable button content positioning.** On Android, Buttons aren't very well designed. 'drawableLeft' and 'drawableRight' have very awkward and difficult to customize positioning. Flutter gives you full control over the positioning of items in your button.\n* **Minimal dependencies.** Flutter comes with so much out of the box. This entire app was built without any external dependencies! (cupertino icons doesn't count :P)\n\n# Flutter Wishlist\n\nFlutter is very new so there are some features and libraries missing that would make development much better. Here are some of those missing components I would have liked to use:\n\n---\n\n>Image Gallery \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSomething to view images with. Android doesn't have a good image viewing library either (sigh).\n\n**UPDATE:** https://github.com/tinylife-io/flutter_scroll_gallery\n\n>Change Button's Inner Contents on Press\n\nThere's no way to set text/icon color when a button is pressed. This lack of functionality really limits the range of buttons one can create.\n\n>Video Player \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSomething to play trailer videos or just videos in general.\n\n**UPDATE:** https://github.com/brianegan/chewie\n\n---\n\nIf any of the above now exists, please let me know.\n\nPull requests are most welcome!\n\nIf you've fixed a bug or have a feature you've added, just create a pull request. If you've found a bug, file an issue. If you have any questions or would like to discuss upcoming features, please get in touch.

Some of the results: 15 min Mujoco humanoid training, 2 min atari pong.\n* Added Brax and Mujoco colab training examples.\n* Added 'seed' command line parameter. Will override seed in config in case it's > 0.\n* Deprecated `horovod` in favor of `torch.distributed` ([#171](https://github.com/Denys88/rl_games/pull/171)).\n\n1.4.0\n\n* Added discord channel https://discord.gg/hnYRq7DsQh :)\n* Added envpool support with a few atari examples. Works 3-4x time faster than ray.\n* Added mujoco results. Much better than openai spinning up ppo results.\n* Added tcnn(https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn) support. Reduces 5-10% of training time in the IsaacGym envs. \n* Various fixes and improvements.\n\n1.3.2\n\n* Added 'sigma' command line parameter. Will override sigma for continuous space in case if fixed_sigma is True.\n\n1.3.1\n\n* Fixed SAC not working\n\n1.3.0\n\n* Simplified rnn implementation. Works a little bit slower but much more stable. \n* Now central value can be non-rnn if policy is rnn.\n* Removed load_checkpoint from the yaml file. now --checkpoint works for both train and play.\n\n1.2.0\n\n* Added Swish (SILU) and GELU activations, it can improve Isaac Gym results for some of the envs.\n* Removed tensorflow and made initial cleanup of the old/unused code.\n* Simplified runner.\n* Now networks are created in the algos with load_network method.\n\n1.1.4\n\n* Fixed crash in a play (test) mode in player, when simulation and rl_devices are not the same.\n* Fixed variuos multi gpu errors.\n\n1.1.3\n\n* Fixed crash when running single Isaac Gym environment in a play (test) mode.\n* Added config parameter ```clip_actions``` for switching off internal action clipping and rescaling\n\n1.1.0\n\n* Added to pypi: ```pip install rl-games```\n* Added reporting env (sim) step fps, without policy inference. Improved naming.\n* Renames in yaml config for better readability: steps_num to horizon_length amd lr_threshold to kl_threshold\n\n\n\n## Troubleshouting\n\n* Some of the supported envs are not installed with setup.py, you need to manually install them\n* Starting from rl-games 1.1.0 old yaml configs won't be compatible with the new version: \n    * ```steps_num``` should be changed to ```horizon_length``` amd ```lr_threshold``` to ```kl_threshold```\n\n## Known issues\n\n* Running a single environment with Isaac Gym can cause crash, if it happens switch to at least 2 environments simulated in parallel\n    \n\n"

Most of these games are actually outstanding games! Even if you don't like Epic and their shenanigans, you will be pleased to know that Epic actually funds all the free copies that are given away:  [\"But we actually found it was more economical to pay developers [a lump sum] to distribute their game free for two weeks...\"](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/03/epic-ceo-youre-going-to-see-lower-prices-on-epic-games-store/)\n\n## Changelog\n\n[Full changelog in Wiki](https://github.com/Revadike/epicgames-freebies-claimer/releases)\n\n## Happy Freebie Claiming!\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4411977/122922274-bb263b00-d363-11eb-8b82-8a3ed6e7e29d.png)\n"

These are the code examples for the book. If you are reading this then you are among the first people in the world getting your hands dirty. If you have issues running the examples, find any inconsistencies and errors, or you have suggestions then please either log an issue or email me at mrspeaker@gmail.com (or ping me @mrspeaker), I will try to help.\n\n[Try the examples](https://spbooks.github.io/html5games1/).\n\nThey will run in all recent browsers - check out all the examples and play some of the games!\n\n## Making your own games\n\nTo modify the code and make your own game you'll need to be able to run it. Each example also includes an npm `package.json` file for converting the code into a single file that can be run in any browser. For each example you need to run:\n\n`npm install`\n\nYou only have to do this once per example. This installs all the dependencies and files needed to run and package your game. Use the command:\n\n`npm start`\n\nIt will start a webserver (at the URL http://localhost:9966/ by default). You can test your changes at the URL.\n\n## Building for the outside world\n\nOnce you've finished your game and are happy with your changes, you can run:\n\n`npm run build`\n\nWhich will convert the code into a single `build.js` file that can be run with the included `index.html` file. These two files (along with any of your game assets and images) can then be deployed to a public server for everyone to play. If you make a game, please let me know on Twitter (@mrspeaker)!\n\n## Getting help\n\nSetting up a workable build system to run code can be the most frustrating aspect of JavaScript development. If you are having any trouble running or modifying the examples, either log an issue on the code repository, send me an email at mrspeaker@gmail.com, or ping me @mrspeaker on twitter - and we'll get it sorted.\n\n## Using JavaScript Native Modules\n\nRecently, most browsers have began to support [JavaScript Native Modules](). this means the step of converting all the code into a single file is not necessary - you can just make changes to your code and see the results without even needing npm.\n\n(For Firefox before version 60 it's enabled behind the about:config `dom.moduleScripts.enabled` flag).\n\nThis is really convenient and cool - however, if you want to run your games locally on your own computer they still need to be served by a webserver. This is because JavaScript modules will only work via `http://` and not `file://` - so you can't just double-click and run it. There is a webserver in the **root directory** (that is, in `html5games1/`) that you can install and run (via `npm`) with:\n\n```\nnpm install\nnpm start\n```\n\nThis will run a server on http://localhost:9966/. If you browse here there will be links to each example.\n\n## Examples to come\n\nI'm organizing the code for each chapter. There's still a little tidying going on. Also, still remaining:\n\n```\nch09/01-02,05-10\n```\n"

Enables extra logging output, debug symbols, and much more verbose compiler warnings (default `Release`).\n- `-DWARNING_AS_ERROR=0` Whether to treat compilation warnings as errors in debug mode (default 1 = yes).\n- `-DUPDATE_TRANSLATIONS=1` Configure `make` to update the translation .ts files for new strings in the source code. Note: Running `make clean` will remove the .ts files (default 0 = no).\n- `-DTEST=1` Enable regression tests (default 0 = no). Note: needs googletest, will be downloaded on the fly if unavailable. To run tests: ```make test```.\n- `-DFORCE_USE_QT5=1` Skip looking for Qt6 before trying to find Qt5\n\n\n# Run\n\n`Cockatrice` is the game client<br>\n`Oracle` fetches card data<br>\n`Servatrice` is the server<br>\n\n**Servatrice Docker container**\n\nYou can run an instance of Servatrice (the Cockatrice server) using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker) and the Cockatrice Dockerfile.<br>\n\nFirst, create an image from the Dockerfile<br>\n`cd /path/to/Cockatrice-Repo/`\n`docker build -t servatrice .`<br>\nAnd then run it<br>\n`docker run -i -p 4747:4747/tcp -t servatrice:latest`<br>\n\n>Note: Running this command exposes the TCP port 4747 of the docker container<br>\nto permit connections to the server.\n\nFind more information on how to use Servatrice with Docker in our [wiki](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/wiki/Setting-up-Servatrice#using-docker).\n\n**Docker compose**\n\nThere is also a docker-compose file available which will configure and run both a MySQL server and Servatrice. The docker-compose setup scripts can be found in the `servatrice/docker` folder and vary only slightly from the default sql and server .ini files. The setup scripts can either be modified in place, or docker-compose can mount alternative files into the images, as you prefer.\n\nTo run Servatrice via docker-compose, first install docker-compose following the [install instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Once installed, run the following from the root of the repository:\n```bash\ndocker-compose build    # Build the Servatrice image using the same Dockerfile as above.\ndocker-compose up       # Setup and run both the MySQL server and Servatrice.\n```\n\n>Note: Similar to the above Docker setup, this will expose TCP ports 4747 and 4748.\n\n>Note: The first time running the docker-compose setup, the MySQL server will take a little time to run the initial setup scripts. Due to this, the Servatrice instance may fail the first few attempts to connect to the database. Servatrice is set to `restart: always` in the docker-compose.yml, which will allow it to continue attempting to start up. Once the MySQL scripts have completed, Servatrice should then connect automatically on the next attempt.\n\n**Docker compose in Windows**\nA out of box working docker-compose file has been added to help setup in Windows.\n\nDocker in Windows requires additional steps in form of using Docker Desktop to allow resource sharing from the drive the volumes are mapped from, as well as potential workarounds needed to get file sharing working in Windows.

  "readme_contents": "![Hexi](/tutorials/screenshots/logoAndIllustration.png)\n\nHexi\n====\n\n**Hexi** is a fun and easy way to make HTML5 games or any other\nkind interactive media using pure JavaScript code. Take a look at \nthe feature list and the [examples](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/tree/master/examples) folder to get started. Keep scrolling, \nand you'll find a complete Quick Start Guide and beginner's tutorials ahead. If you've never made a game before, the tutorials are the best place to start.\n\nWhat's great about Hexi? You get all the power of WebGL rendering with\na streamlined API that lets you write your code in a\n[minimalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku),\n[declarative](http://latentflip.com/imperative-vs-declarative/) way.\nIt makes coding a game as easy and fun as writing poetry or drawing. Try it! If you\nneed any help or have any questions, post something in this\nrepository's [Issues](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/issues).\nThe Issues page is is Hexi's friendly chat room - don't be afraid to\nask for help :) \n\nYou only need one file from this repository to get started using Hexi:\n[`hexi.min.js`](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/blob/master/bin/hexi.min.js). That's all! [Link it to your HTML document with a `<script>` tag](http://www.quackit.com/javascript/tutorial/external_javascript_file.cfm), and go for it! \nHexi has been written, from the ground up, in the latest version of\nJavaScript (ES6/7, 20015/6) but is compiled down to ES5 (using [Babel](https://babeljs.io)) so that it will run anywhere. What do you need to know before you start using Hexi? You should have a reasonable understanding of HTML and JavaScript. You don't have to be an expert, just an ambitious beginner with an eagerness to learn. If you don't know HTML and JavaScript, the best place to start learning it is this book:\n\n[Foundation Game Design with HTML5 and JavaScript](http://www.apress.com/9781430247166)\n\nI know for a fact that it's the best book, because I wrote it!\n\nOk, got it? Do you know what JavaScript variables, functions, arrays and objects are and how to use them? Do you know what [JSON data files](http://www.copterlabs.com/blog/json-what-it-is-how-it-works-how-to-use-it/) are? Have you used the [Canvas Drawing API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Drawing_graphics_with_canvas)? Then you're ready to start using Hexi!  \n\nOf course, Hexi is completely free to use: for-anything, for-ever! It was written in Canada (Toronto, Hamilton), India (Kullu Valley, Ladakh), Nepal (Kathmandu, Pokhara, Annapurna Base Camp), Thailand (Ko Phangan, Ko Tao) and South Africa (Cape Town), and is the result of 15 years' research into API usability for game design. The name, \"Hexi\" comes from [\"Hex\"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hex) + [\"Pixi\"](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/) = \"Hexi\".

[A Guide to the examples](#aguidetotheexamples)\n\n<a id='features'></a>\nFeatures\n--------\n\nHere's Hexi's core feature list:\n\n- All the most important sprites you need: rectangles, circles, lines,\n  text, image sprites and animated \"MovieClip\" style sprites. You can make any of these sprites with one only line of code. You can also create your own custom sprite types.\n- A complete scene graph with nested child-parent hierarchies (including\n  a `stage`, and `addChild`/`removeChild` methods), local and global\n  coordinates, depth layers, and rotation pivots.\n- `group` sprites together to make game scenes. \n- A game loop with a user-definable `fps` and fully customizable and\n  drop-dead-simple game state manager. `pause` and `resume` the game\n  loop at any time.\n- Tileset (spritesheet) support using `frame` and `filmstrip` methods to make\n  sprites using tileset frames.\n- Built-in texture atlas support for the popular Texture Packer\n  format. \n- A keyframe animation and state manager for sprites. Use `show` to\n  display a sprite's image state. Use `playAnimation` to play\n  a sequence of frames (in a `loop` if you want to). Use\n  `show` to display a specific frame number. Use `fps` to set the\n  frame rate for sprite animations which is independent from the game's\n  frame rate.\n- Interactive `button` sprites with `up`, `over` and `down` states.\n- Any sprite can be set to `interact` to receive mouse and touch\n  actions.\n  Intuitive `press`, `release`, `over`, `out` and `tap` methods for buttons and interactive\n  sprites.\n- Easy-to-use keyboard key bindings. Easily define your own with the `keyboard`\n  method.\n- A built-in universal `pointer` that works with both the mouse and\n  touch. Assign your own custom `press`, `release` and `tap` methods\n  or use any of the pointer's built-in properties: `isUp`, `isDown`,\n  `tapped`, `x` and `y`. Define as many pointers as you need for multi-touch. (It also works with isometric maps!)\n- Conveniently position sprites relative to other sprites using\n  `putTop`, `putRight`, `putBottom`, `putLeft` and `putCenter`. Align\n  sprites horizontally or vertically using `flowRight`, `flowLeft`,\n  `flowUp` or `flowDown`.\n- A universal asset loader to pre-load images, fonts, sounds and JSON\n  data files. All popular file formats are supported. You can load new assets into the game at any time.\n- An optional `load` state that lets you run actions while assets are\n  loading. You can use the `load` state to add a loading progress bar.\n- A fast and focused [Pixi-based](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/) rendering engine. If Pixi can do it, so can Hexi! Hexi \n  is just a thin layer of code that sits on top of Pixi. And you can access the\n  global `PIXI` object at any time to write pure Pixi code directly if you want\n  to. Hexi includes the latest stable version of Pixi v3.0 automatically bundled for you.\n- A sophisticated game loop using a fixed timestep with variable rendering\n  and sprite interpolation. That means you get butter-smooth sprite animations\n  at any framerate.\n- A compact and powerful \"Haiku\" style API that's centered on shallow,\n  composable components. Get more done writing less code.\n- Import and play sounds using a built-in WebAudio API sound manager.\n  Control sounds with `play`, `pause`, `stop`, `restart`,\n  `playFrom`, `fadeIn` and `fadeOut` methods. Change a sound's `volume` and `pan`.\n- Generate your own custom sound effects from pure code with\n  the versatile `soundEffect` method.\n- Shake sprites or the screen with `shake`.\n- Tween functions for sprite and scene transitions: `slide`,\n  `fadeIn`, `fadeOut`, `pulse`, `breathe`, `wobble`, `strobe` and\n  some useful low-level tweening methods to help you create your own\n  custom tweens.\n- Make a sprite follow a connected series of waypoints with `walkPath`\n  and `walkCurve`. \n- A handful of useful convenience functions: `followEase`,\n  `followConstant`,\n  `angle`, `distance`, `rotateAroundSprite`, `rotateAroundPoint`, `wait`,\n  `randomInt`, `randomFloat`, `contain` and `outsideBounds`.\n- A fast, universal `hit` method that handles collision testing and\n  reactions (blocking and bounce) for all types of sprites. Use one collision method for\n  everything: rectangles, circles, points, and arrays of sprites.\n  Easy!\n- A companion suite of lightweight, low-level 2D geometric collision methods.\n- A loading progress bar for game assets.\n- Make sprites shoot things with `shoot`. \n- Easily plot sprites in a grid formation with `grid`.\n- Use a `tilingSprite` to easily create a seamless scrolling background.\n- A `createParticles` function for creating all kinds of particle\n  effects for games. Use the `particleEmitter` function to create a constant\n  stream of particles.\n- Use `scaleToWindow` to make the game automatically scale to its maximum size and align itself for the best fit inside the browser window. \n- Tiled Editor support using `makeTiledWorld`. Design your game in\n  Tiled Editor and access all the sprites, layers and objects directly\n  in your game code. It's an extremely fun, quick and easy way to make\n  games.\n- A versatile, `hitTestTile` method that handles all the collision\n  checking you'll need for tile-based games. You can use it in combination\n  with the any of the 2D geometric collision methods for optimized\n  broadphase/narrowphase collision checking if you want to.\n- Use `updateMap` to keep a tile-based world's map data array up-to-date\n  with moving sprites.\n- Create a `worldCamera` that follows sprites around a scrolling game\n  world.\n- A `lineOfSight` function that tells you whether a sprite is visible to   another sprite.\n- Seamless integration with HTML and CSS elements for creating rich\n  user interfaces. Use Hexi also works with Angular, React and Elm!\n- A complete suite of tools for easily creating isometric game worlds, including: an isometric mouse/touch pointer, isometric tile collision using `hitTestIsoTile`, and full Tiled Editor isometric map support using `makeIsoTiledWorld`.\n- A `shortestPath` function for doing A-Star pathfinding through tile based environments like mazes and a `tileBasedLineOfSight` function to tell you whether sprites in a maze game environment can see each other.\n- Yes, Hexi applications meet W3C accessibilty guidelines thanks to the [`accessible`](http://www.goodboydigital.com/pixi-becomes-accessible/) property provided by the Pixi renderer (yay Pixi!)\n\n<a id='features'></a>\n### Hexi's modules\n\nHexi contains a collection of useful modules, and you use any of the\nproperties or methods of these modules in your high-level Hexi code.\n\n- [Pixi](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/): The world's fastest 2D WebGL and canvas renderer.\n- [Bump](https://github.com/kittykatattack/bump): A complete suite of 2D collision functions for games.\n- [Tink](https://github.com/kittykatattack/tink): Drag-and-drop, buttons, a universal pointer and other\n  helpful interactivity tools.\n- [Charm](https://github.com/kittykatattack/charm): Easy-to-use tweening animation effects for Pixi sprites.\n- [Dust](https://github.com/kittykatattack/dust): Particle effects for creating things like explosions, fire\n  and magic.\n- [Sprite Utilities](https://github.com/kittykatattack/spriteUtilities): Easier and more intuitive ways to\n  create and use Pixi sprites, as well adding a state machine and\n  animation player\n- [Game Utilities](https://github.com/kittykatattack/gameUtilities): A collection of useful methods for games.\n- [Tile Utilities](https://github.com/kittykatattack/tileUtilities): A collection of useful methods for making tile-based game worlds with [Tiled Editor](http://www.mapeditor.org). Includes a full suite of isometric map utilities.\n- [Sound.js](https://github.com/kittykatattack/sound.js): A micro-library for loading, controlling and generating\n  sound and music effects. Everything you need to add sound to games.\n- [Smoothie](https://github.com/kittykatattack/smoothie): Ultra-smooth sprite animation using \n  true delta-time interpolation. It also lets you specify the fps (frames-per-second) at which \n  your game or application runs, and completely separates your sprite rendering loop from your\n  application logic loop.\n\nRead the documents at the code repositories for each of these modules to find out\nwhat you can do with them and exactly how they work. Because they're\nall built into Hexi, you don't have to install them yourself - they\njust work right out-of-the-box.\n\nHexi lets you access most of these module methods and properties as\n**top-level objects**. For example, if you want to access the `hit` method\nfrom the Bump collision module, you can do it like this:\n```js\ng.hit(spriteOne, spriteTwo);\n```\nBut you can also access the Bump module directly if you need to, like this:\n```js\ng.bump.hit(spriteOne, spriteTwo);\n```\n(This assumes that your Hexi instance is called `g`);\n\nJust refer to the module name using **lowerCamelCase**. That means you can\naccess the Smoothie module as `smoothie` and the Sprite Utilities\nmodule as `spriteUtilities`.\n\nThere are two exceptions to this convention. You can access the Pixi\nglobal object directly as `PIXI`. Also, the functions in the Sound.js module\nare also only accessible as top-level global objects. This is was done\nto simplify the way these modules are integrated with Hexi, and\nmaintain the widest possible cross-platform compatibility.\n\nIf you're a developer and would like to contribute to Hexi, the best\nway is to contribute new and improved features to these modules. Or,\nif you're really ambitious, propose a new module to the Hexi\ndevelopment team (in this repo's [Issues](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/issues),\nand maybe we'll add it to Hexi's core!)\n\n<a id='quickstart'></a>\nHexi quick start\n----------------\n\nTo start working with Hexi quickly, take a look at the Quick Start\nproject in Hexi's [examples\nfolder](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/tree/master/examples).\nYou'll find the [HTML container page here](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/blob/master/examples/01_quickStart.html) and the [JavaScript\nsource file here](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/blob/master/examples/src/quickStart.js). The source code is fully commented and explains how all everything works so, if you want to, you can just skip straight to that file and read through it. (You'll find the complied, ES5, version of the JavaScript file [in the `bin` folder](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/tree/master/examples/bin).) \n\nThe Quick Start project is a tour of all of Hexi's main features, and you can use it as a template for making your own new Hexi applications. Click on the image below to try a working example:\n\n[![Quick start](/tutorials/screenshots/30.png)](https://cdn.gitcdn.xyz/cdn/kittykatattack/hexi/a1713aa19bdcc9a0c661e67d079a205d7c221917/examples/01_quickStart.html)\n\nYou'll first see a loading bar that shows you the percentage of files\n(sounds and images) being loaded. You'll then see a spinning message that asks to you to tap on the screen to create cats. Cats will appear on the screen wherever you click with the pointer while music plays in\nthe background. (Oops, Sorry! I forgot to warn you about the music!) A text field rotates and counts the number of cats\nyou've created. The cats themselves move and bounce around the\nscreen, while scaling in size and oscillating their transparency.\nHere's an illustration of what you'll see:\n\n![Quick start illustration](/tutorials/screenshots/31.png)\n\nWhy cats? [Because](http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/toxo-terror-are-our-brains-controlled-by-cat-loving-parasites).\n\nIf you know how this Quick Start application was made, you'll be well on your\nway to being productive with Hexi fast - so let's find out!\n\n(Note: If you're new to game programming and feel you need a gentler,\nmore methodical, introduction to Hexi, check out the [Tutorials](#tutorials) section ahead. You'll learn how to make 3 complete games from scratch, and each game gradually builds on the skills you learnt in the previous game.)\n\n<a id='thehtmlcontainer'></a>\n### The HTML container\n\nThe only file you need to start using Hexi is\n[`hexi.min.js`](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/blob/master/bin/hexi.min.js). It has an incredibly simple \"installation\": Just link it to an HTML page with a `<script>` tag. Then link your main JavaScript file that will contain your game or application code. Here's what a typical Hexi HTML container page might look like:\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<title>Hexi</title>\n<body>\n<script src=\"hexi.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"main.js\"></script>\n</body>\n```\nYou can, of course, load as many external script files that you need\nfor your game.\n\nIf you need a little more fine-control, you can alternatively load\nHexi using three separate files: The Pixi renderer, Hexi's modules, and Hexi's `core.js`file. \n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<title>Hexi</title>\n<body>\n\n<!-- Pixi renderer, Hexi's modules, and Hexi's core  -->\n<script src=\"pixi.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"modules.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"core.js\"></script>\n\n<!-- Main application file -->\n<script src=\"bin/quickStart.js\"></script>\n</body>\n```\nAn advantage to doing this is that it lets you swap out Hexi's\ninternal version of Pixi, with your own custom build of Pixi, or a\nspecific version of Pixi that you want to use. Or maybe you made some\nother crazy modifications to Hexi's modules that you want to try out. But typically, you'll probably never need to do this.\n\n<a id='hexisarchitecture'></a>\n### Hexi's Architecture\n\nAll the fun happens in your main JavaScript file. Hexi\napplications have a very simple but flexible architecture that you can\nscale to any size you need. Small games with a few hundred lines of code or big games with a few hundred files - Hexi can do it!\nHere's the structure of at typical Hexi application:\n\n1. Start Hexi.\n2. The `load` function, that will run while your files are loading.\n3. The `setup` function, which initializes your game objects, variables and sprites.\n4. The `play` function, which is your game or application logic that runs in a loop.\n\nAnd Here's what this actually looks like in real code:\n\n```js\n//1. Setting up and starting Hexi\n\n//An array of files you want to load\nlet thingsToLoad = [\"anyFiles\", \"youWant\", \"toLoad\"];\n\n//Initialize and start Hexi\nlet g = hexi(canvasWidth, canvasHeight, setup, thingsToLoad, load);\ng.start();\n\n//2. The `load` function that will run while your files are loading\n\nfunction load(){\n  \n  //Display an optional loading bar\n  g.loadingBar();\n}\n\n//3. The `setup` function, which initializes your game objects, variables and sprites\n\nfunction setup() {\n\n  //Create your game objects here\n\n  //Set the game state to `play` to start the game loop\n  g.state = play;\n}\n\n//4. The `play` function, which is your game or application logic that runs in a loop\n\nfunction play(){\n  //This is your game loop, where you can move sprites and add your\n  //game logic\n}\n```\nThis simple model is all you need to create any kind of game or application.\nYou can use it as the starting template for your own projects, and this same\nbasic model can scale to any size.\n\nLet's find out how this architectural model was used to build the Quick\nStart application.\n\n<a id='settingupandstartinghexi'></a>\n### 1. Setting up and starting Hexi\n\nFirst, create an array that lists all the files you want to load. The Quick\nStart project loads an image file, a font file, and a music file.\n```js\nlet thingsToLoad = [\n  \"images/cat.png\",\n  \"fonts/puzzler.otf\",\n  \"sounds/music.wav\"\n];\n```\nIf you don't have any files you want to load, just skip this step.\n\nNext, initialize Hexi with the `hexi` function. Here's how to initialize a\nnew Hexi application with a screen size of 512x512 pixels. It tells\nHexi to load the files in the `thingsToLoad` array, run a function called `load` while\nits loading, and then run a function called `setup` when everything is ready to go.\n```js\nlet g = hexi(512, 512, setup, thingsToLoad, load);\n```\nYou can now access the instance of Hexi in your application through an\nobject called `g` (Although, you can give this any name you like. I\nlike using \"g\" because it stands for \"game\", and is short to type.)\n\nThe `hexi` function has 5 arguments, although only the first 3 are required.\n\n1. Canvas width.\n2. Canvas height. \n3. The `setup` function.\n4. The `thingsToLoad` array you defined above. This is optional.\n5. The `load` function. This is also optional.\n\nIf you skip the last two arguments, Hexi will skip the loading process and jump straight to the `setup` function.\n\nOptionally Set the frames per second at which the game logic loop should run.\n(Sprites will be rendered independently, with interpolation, at full 60 fps)\nIf you don't set the `fps`, Hexi will default to an fps of 60.\n```js\ng.fps = 30;\n```\nSetting an fps lower than 60 gives you much more performance overhead to play\nwith, and your games will still look great.\n\nYou can also optionally add a border and set the background color.\n```js\ng.border = \"2px red dashed\";\ng.backgroundColor = 0x000000;\n```\nAnd, if you want to scale and align the game screen to the maximum browser\nwindow size, you can use the `scaleToWindow` method.\n```js\ng.scaleToWindow();\n```\nFinally, call the `start` method to get Hexi running\n```js\ng.start();\n```\nThis is important! Without calling the `start` method Hexi won't\nstart!\n\n<a id='theloadfunction'></a>\n### 2. The `load` function, that runs while things are loading\n\nIf you supplied Hexi with a function called `load` when you initialized it, you can display a loading bar and loading progress information. Just create a function called `load`, like this:\n```js\nfunction load(){\n\n  //Display the file currently being loaded\n  console.log(`loading: ${g.loadingFile}`); \n\n  //Display the percentage of files currently loaded\n  console.log(`progress: ${g.loadingProgress}`);\n\n  //Add an optional loading bar \n  g.loadingBar();\n}\n```\n<a id='thesetupfunction'></a>\n### 3. The `setup` function, which initializes and creates your game objects\n\nNow that you've started Hexi and loaded all your files, you can start\nmaking things! This happens in the `setup` function. If you have any\nobjects or variables that you want to use across more than one\nfunction, define them outside the `setup` function, like this:\n```js\n//These things will be used in more than one function\nlet cats, message;\n\n//Use the `setup` function to create things\nfunction setup(){\n\n  //... create things here! ... \n}\n```\nLet's find out how the code inside the `setup` function works. We're going\nto be making cats - lots of cats! - so it's useful to create a `group` called\n`cats`to keep them all together.\n```js\ncats = g.group();\n```\nIn the Quick Start project you can make a new cat by tapping the\nscreen with the mouse (or touch.) So, we need a function that will\nproduce new cat **sprites** for us. (Sprites are interactive graphics that you can animate and move around the screen.) Hexi lets you create a new sprite using the `sprite` method. Just supply `sprite` with file name that you want to use for the sprite. Each new cat sprite that's created should be positioned and added add to the cats `group`, using the `addChild` method. We also want the cat to animate its scale using the `breathe` method and animate its transparency using the `pulse` method. A function called `makeCats` does all this. `makeCats` takes two arguments: the x and y\nposition where you want the cat to appear, relative to the top left corner of the screen.\n```js\nlet makeCat = (x, y) => {\n\n  //Create the cat sprite. Supply the `sprite` method with \n  //the name of the loaded image that should be displayed\n  let cat = g.sprite(\"images/cat.png\");\n\n  //Set the cat's position\n  cat.setPosition(x, y);\n\n  //You can alternatively set the position my modifying the sprite's `x` and\n  //`y` properties directly, like this\n  //cat.x = x;\n  //cat.y = y;\n\n  //Add some optional tween animation effects from the Hexi's \n  //built-in tween library (called Charm). `breathe` makes the\n  //sprite scale in and out. `pulse` oscillates its transparency\n  g.breathe(cat, 2, 2, 20);\n  g.pulse(cat, 10, 0.5);\n\n  //Set the cat's velocity to a random number between -10 and 10\n  cat.vx = g.randomInt(-10, 10);\n  cat.vy = g.randomInt(-10, 10);\n\n  //Add the cat to the `cats` group\n  cats.addChild(cat);\n};\n\n```\n(You can find out more about how the `breathe` and `pulse` methods work to\nanimate the cat in the [tweening example](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/blob/master/examples/src/tweening.js) in the [examples folder](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/tree/master/examples).)\n\nWe also need to create a `text` sprite to display the words \"Tap for\ncats!\" We can use Hexi's `text` method to do that.\n```js\nmessage = g.text(\"Tap for cats!\", \"38px puzzler\", \"red\");\n```\nThe `text` method's arguments are the text you want to display, the\nfont size and family, and the color (You can use any HTML/CSS color\nstring value, RGBA or HSLA values).\n\nUse Hexi's `putCenter` method to center the text inside the `stage`.\n```js\ng.stage.putCenter(message);\n```\nWhat's the `stage`? It's the root container that all Hexi sprites\nbelong to when they're first created. \n\nYou can also use `putLeft`, `putRight`, `putTop` or `putBottom` methods to help you align objects relative to other objects. The optional 2nd and 3rd arguments of these methods define the x and y offset, which help you fine-tune positioning.\n\nBecause we want the text message to rotate around its center point we\nhave to set its `pivotX` and `pivotY` values to 0.5.\n```js\nmessage.pivotX = 0.5;\nmessage.pivotY = 0.5;\n```\n0.5 means \"the very center of the sprite\".\n\nYou can also use this alternative syntax to set the pivot point:\n```js\nmessage.setPivot(0.5, 0.5);\n```\nWe need some way to tell Hexi to create a new cat whenever the screen\nis clicked or tapped. We also want the text message to tell us how many cats are currently on the screen. Hexi has a built in `pointer` object with a `tap` method that we can program to help us do this.\n```js\ng.pointer.tap = () => {\n  \n  //Supply `makeCat` with the pointer's `x` and `y` coordinates.\n  makeCat(g.pointer.x, g.pointer.y);\n\n  //Make the `message.content` display the number of cats \n  message.content = `${cats.children.length}`;\n};\n```\nWe also want the music file that we loaded to start playing. We can\naccess the music sound object with Hexi's `sound` method. Use the sound object's `loop`\nmethod to make it loop continuously, and use `play` to start it playing right away.\n```js\nlet music = g.sound(\"sounds/music.wav\");\nmusic.loop = true;\nmusic.play();\n```\nWe're now done setting everything up! That means we're finished with\nour application's `setup` state and can now switch the state to `play`. Here's how to do that: \n```js\ng.state = play;\n```\nThe `play` state is a function that will run in a loop, and is where\nall our application logic is. Let's find out how that works next.\n\n<a id='thesplayfunction'></a>\n### 4. The `play` function: the looping application logic\n\nThe last thing you need in your Hexi application is a `play` function.\n```js\nfunction play() {\n\n  //All this code will run in a loop\n}\n```\nThe `play` function is called in a continuous loop, at whatever fps\n(frames per second) value you set. This is your **game logic loop**. (The\nrender loop will be run by Hexi in the background at the maximum fps\nyour system can handle.) You can pause Hexi's game loop at any time\nwith the `pause` method, and restart it with the `resume` method.\n(Check out the [Flappy Fairy](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/blob/master/tutorials/src/flappyFairy.js) project to find out how `pause` and\n`resume` can be used to manage an application with complex states.)\n\nThe Quick Start project's `play` function just does two things: It\nmakes the text rotate, and moves and bounces the cats around the\nscreen. Here's the entire `play` function that does all this.\n```js\nfunction play() {\n  \n  //Rotate the text \n  message.rotation += 0.1;\n\n  //Loop through all of the cats to make them move and bounce off the\n  //edges of the stage\n  cats.children.forEach(cat => {\n\n    //Make the cat bounce off the screen edges\n    let collision = g.contain(cat, g.stage, true);\n\n    //Move the cat\n    g.move(cat);\n  });\n}\n```\nThat's all! Compared to all the work we put into the `setup` function, the\n`play` function does practically nothing! But how does it work?\n\nIt first makes the text rotate around its center by updating the\n`message` text sprite's `rotation` property by 0.1 radians.\n```js\nmessage.rotation += 0.1;\n```\nBecause this new rotation value is being applied to the old rotation value inside a continuous loop, it gradually increases the value and makes the text rotate.\n\nThe next thing the code does is loop through all the sprites in the\n`cat` group's `children` array.\n```js\ncats.children.forEach(cat => {\n  //Loop through each `cat` sprite in the `chidren` array\n});\n```\nAll Hexi groups have an array called `children` which\ntells you which sprites they contain. Whenever you add a sprite to a\ngroup using the `addChild` method, the sprite is added to the group's\n`children` array. Hexi's root container, called the `stage`, also has\na `children` array that contains all the sprites and groups in your\nHexi application. Even `sprite` objects have a `children` array, and\nthat means you can use `addChild` to group sprites with other sprites\nto create complex game objects.\n\nWhen the code loops through each cat, it first checks whether the cat\nis touching the edges of the screen and, if it is, it bounces it away\nin the opposite direction. Hexi's `contain` method helps us do this.\n```js\nlet collision = g.contain(cat, g.stage, true);\n```\nSetting the third argument to `true` is what causes the cat to bounce.\n\nThe cat moves around the screen with the help of the `move` method.\n```js\ng.move(cat);\n```\nThe `move` method updates the sprite's position by its `vx` and `vy` velocity values. (All Hexi sprites have `vx` and `vy` values, which are initialized to zero). You can move more than one sprite at a time by supplying `move` with a list of sprites, separated by commas. You can even supply it with an array that that contains all the sprites you want to move. Here's what `move` is actually doing under the hood:\n```js\ncat.x += cat.vx;\ncat.y += cat.vy;\n```\nAnd that's all there is to it! This is everything you know about the Quick Start application, and almost everything you need to know about Hexi!\n\n<a id='takingitfurther'></a>\n### Taking it further\n\nWith this basic Hexi architecture, you can create anything. Just set Hexi's `state` property to any other function to switch the behaviour of your application. Here's how:\n```js\ng.state = anyStateFunction;\n```\nStates are just plain old JavaScript funtctions!\nNice and simple!\n\nWrite as many state functions as you need. If it's a small project, you can keep all these functions in one file. But, for a big project, load your functions from external JS files as you need them. Use any module system you prefer, like ES6 modules, CommonJS, AMD, or good old HTML `<script>` tags.  This simple architectural model can scale to any size, and is the only architectural model you need to know. Keep it simple and stay happy!\n\nNow that you've got a broad overview of how Hexi works, read through\nthe tutorials to dive into the details.\n\n<a id='tutorials'></a>\nTutorials\n---------\n\nThe first game we're going to make is a simple object collection and\nenemy avoidance game called Treasure Hunter. Open the file\n`01_treasureHunter.html` in a web browser. (You'll find it in Hexi's\n`tutorials` folder, and you'll need to run it in a\n[webserver](https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server)). If you don't\nwant to bother setting up a webserver, use a text-editor like\n[Brackets](http://brackets.io) that will launch one for you\nautomatically (see Brackets' documentation for this feature).\n\n[![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/01.png)](https://gitcdn.xyz/repo/kittykatattack/hexi/master/tutorials/01_treasureHunter.html)\n\n(Follow the link in the image above to play the game.) Use the keyboard to move the explorer (the blue square), collect the\ntreasure (the yellow square), avoid the monsters (the red squares) and\nreach the exit (the green square.) Yes, you have to use your\nimagination - for now. \n\nHere's the complete JavaScript source code:\n\n[!Treasure Hunter Source](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/blob/master/tutorials/src/treasureHunter.js)\n\nDon't be fooled by it's apparent simplicity. Treasure Hunter contains\neverything a video game needs:\n\n- Interactivity\n- Collision\n- Sprites\n- A game loop\n- Scenes\n- game logic\n- \"Juice\" (in the form of sounds)\n\n(What's juice? [Watch this\nvideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg) and \n[read this article](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130848/how_to_prototype_a_game_in_under_7_.php?print=1) to learn\nabout this essential game design ingredient.)\n\nIf you can make a simple game like Treasure Hunter, you can make\nalmost any other kind of game. Yes, really! Getting from Treasure\nHunter to Skyrim or Zelda\nis just a matter of lots of small steps; adding more\ndetail as you go. How much detail you want to add is up to you. \n\nIn the first stage of this tutorial you'll learn how the basic\nTreasure Hunter game was made, and then we'll add some fun features like images and\ncharacter animation that will give you a complete overview of how the\nHexi works. \n\nIf you're an experienced game programmer and\nquick self-starter, you might find the code in [Hexi's `examples` folder](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/tree/master/examples) to\nbe a more productive place to start learning - check it out. The fully\ncommented\ncode in the `examples` folder also details specific, and advanced uses\nof features, that aren't\ncovered in these tutorials. When you're finished working through these\ntutorials, the `examples` will take you on the next stage of your\njourney.\n\n<a id='setingup'></a>\n#### Setting up the HTML container page\n\nBefore you can start programming in JavaScript, you need to set up a\nminimal HTML container page. The HTML page loads `hexi.min.js` which\nis the only file you need to use all of Hexi's\nfeatures. It also load the `treasureHunter.js` file, which is the\nJavaScript file that contains all the game code. \n```js\n<!doctype html>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<title>Treasure hunter</title>\n<body>\n<!-- Hexi -->\n<script src=\"../bin/hexi.min.js\"></script>\n\n<!-- Main application file -->\n<script src=\"bin/treasureHunter.js\"></script>\n</body>\n```\nThis is the [minimum amount of HTML code you need for a valid HTML5\ndocument](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9797046/whats-a-valid-html5-document).\n\nThe file paths may be different on your system, depending on how\nyou've set up your project file structure.\n\n<a id='initializing'></a>\n#### Initializing Hexi \n\nThe next step is to write some JavaScript code that initializes and starts Hexi \naccording to some parameters that you specify. This bit of\ncode below initializes a game with a screen size of 512 by 512 pixels.\nIt also pre-loads the `chimes.wav` sound file from the `sounds`\nfolder.\n```js\n//Initialize Hexi and load the chimes sound file\nlet g = hexi(512, 512, setup, [\"sounds/chimes.wav\"]);\n\n//Scale the game canvas to the maximum size in the browser\ng.scaleToWindow();\n\n//Start the Hexi engine.\ng.start();\n\n```\nYou can see that the result of the `hexi` function is being assigned to\nan variable called `g`. \n```js\nlet g = hexi(//...\n```\nNow, whenever you want to use any of Hexi's custom\nmethods or objects in your game, just prefix it with `g`. (You don't\nhave to use `g` to represent the game engine, you can use any variable\nname you want. `g` is just nice, short, and easy to remember; `g` =\n\"game\".)\n\nIn this example Hexi creates a canvas element with a size of 512 by 512\npixels. That's specified by the first two arguments:\n```js \n512, 512, setup,\n```\nThe third argument, `setup`, means that as soon as Hexi is initialized,\nit should look for and run a function in your game code called `setup`.\nWhatever code is in the `setup` function is entirely up to you, and\nyou'll soon see how you can used it to initialize a game. (You don't\nhave to call this function `setup`, you can use any name you like.) \n\nHexi lets you pre-load game assets with an optional 4th argument, which\nis an array of file names. In this first example, you only need to preload one file: `chimes.wav`\nYou can see that the full file path to `chimes.wav` is listed as a\nstring in the\ninitialization array:\n```js\n[\"sounds/chimes.wav\"]\n\n```\nYou can list as many game assets as you like here, including images,\nfonts, and JSON files. Hexi will load all these assets for you before\nrunning any of the game code.\n\nHexi just implement's [Pixi's superb resource loader](https://github.com/englercj/resource-loader)\nunder-the-hood.  You can access the loader directly through Hexi's `loader`\nproperty, and you can access the resources through the `resources` property. Or, just use `PIXI.loader` directly, if you want to. You can\nfind out more about [how Pixi's loader works here](https://github.com/kittykatattack/learningPixi#loading).\n\nWe want the game canvas to scale to\nthe maximum size of the browser window, so that it displays as large\nas possible. We can use a useful method called `scaleToWindow` to do\nthis for us.\n```js\ng.scaleToWindow();\n```\n`scaleToWindow` will center your game for the best fit. Long, wide\ngame screens are centered vertically. Tall or square screens are\ncentered horizontally. If you want to specify your own browser\nbackground color that borders the game, supply it in `scaleToWindow`'s\narguments, like this:\n```\ng.scaleToWindow(\"seaGreen\");\n```\nThe last thing you need to do is call Hexi's `start` method. \n```js\ng.start();\n```\nThis is the switch that turns the Hexi engine on.\n\n<a id='definingglobals'></a>\n#### Define your \"global\" variables\n\nAfter Hexi has been started, declare all the variables that your game\nfunctions will need to use.\n```js\nlet dungeon, player, treasure, enemies, chimes, exit,\n    healthBar, message, gameScene, gameOverScene;\n```\nBecause they're not enclosed inside a function, these variables are \"global\" \nin the sense that you can use them across all of your game functions.\n(They're not necessarily \"global\" in the sense that they inhabit the\nglobal JavaScript name-space. If you want to ensure that they aren't, [wrap all of\nyour JavaScript code in an enclosing **immediate function** to isolate it\nfrom the global\nspace](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17058606/why-using-self-executing-function-in-javascript). Or, if you want to\ndo it the fancy way, use JavaScript ES6/2015 [modules](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html) or [classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), to enforce local scope.\n\n<a id='setupfunction'></a>\n#### Initialize your game with a setup function\n\nAs soon as Hexi starts, it will look for and run a function in your game\ncode called `setup` (or whatever other name you want to give this\nfunction.) The `setup` function is only run once, and lets you perform\none-time setup tasks for your game. It's a great place to create and initialize\nobjects, create sprites, game scenes, populate data arrays or parse\nloaded JSON game data. \n\nHere's an abridged, birds-eye view of the `setup` function in Treasure Hunter,\nand the tasks that it performs.\n```js\nfunction setup() {\n  //Create the `chimes` sound object\n  //Create the `gameScene` group\n  //Create the `exit` door sprite\n  //Create the `player` sprite\n  //Create the `treasure` sprite\n  //Make the enemies\n  //Create the health bar\n  //Add some text for the game over message\n  //Create a `gameOverScene` group \n  //Assign the player's keyboard controllers\n\n  //set the game state to `play`\n  g.state = play;\n}\n```\nThe last line of code, `g.state = play` is perhaps the most important\nbecause it starts the `play` function. The `play` function runs all the game logic\nin a loop. But before we look at how that works, let's see what the\nspecific code inside the `setup` function does.\n\n<a id='creatingsound'></a>\n##### Creating the `chimes` sound object\n\nYou'll remember from the code above that we preloaded a sound file\ninto the game called `chimes.wav`. Before you can use it in your game,\nyou have to make a reference to it using Hexi's `sound` method,\nlike this:\n```js\nchimes = g.sound(\"sounds/chimes.wav\");\n```\n<a id='gamescenes'></a>\n##### Creating game scenes\n\nHexi has a useful method called `group` that lets you group game objects\ntogether so that you can work with them as one unit. Groups are used for\ngrouping together special objects called **sprites**  (which you'll\nlearn all about in the next section.) But they're also used for making game scenes. \n\nTreasure Hunter uses two game scenes: `gameScene` which is the main game, \nand `gameOverScene` which is displayed when the game is finished. \nHere's how the `gameScene` is made using the `group` method:\n```js\ngameScene = g.group();\n```\nAfter you've made the group, you can add sprites (game objects) to the `gameScene`, using\nthe `addChild` method.\n```js    \ngameScene.addChild(anySprite);\n```\nOr, you can add multiple sprites at one time with the `add` method, like this:\n```js\ngameScene.add(spriteOne, spriteTwo, spriteThree);\n```\nOr, if you prefer, you can create the game scene after you've made all\nthe sprites, and group all the sprites together with one line of code, like this:\n```js\ngameScene = g.group(spriteOne, spriteTwp, spriteThree);\n```\nYou'll see a few different examples of how to add sprites to groups in\nthe examples ahead.\n\nBut what are sprites, and how do you make them?\n\n<a id='makingsprites'></a>\n##### Making sprites\n\nSprites are the most important elements in any game. Sprites are\njust graphics (shapes or images) that you can control with\nspecial properties. Everything you can see in your games, like\ngame characters, objects and backgrounds, are sprites. Hexi lets you make\n5 kinds of basic sprites: `rectangle`, `circle`, `line`, `text`, and\n`sprite` (an image-based sprite). You can make almost any 2D action game\nwith these basic sprite types. (If they aren't enough, you can also define your own custom\nsprite types.) This first version of Treasure Hunter\nonly uses `rectangle` sprites. You can make a rectangle sprite like\nthis:\n```js\nlet box = g.rectangle(\n  widthInPixels, \n  heightInPixels, \n  \"fillColor\", \n  \"strokeColor\", \n  lineWidth, \n  xPosition, \n  yPosition\n);\n```\nYou can use Hexi's `circle` method to make a circular shaped sprite:\n```js\nlet ball = g.circle(\n  diameterInPixels, \n  \"fillColor\", \n  \"strokeColor\", \n  lineWidth,\n  xPosition, \n  yPosition \n);\n```\nIt's often useful to prototype a new game using only `rectangle` and\n`circle` sprites, because that can help you focus on the mechanics of your\ngame in a pure, elemental way. That's what this first version of\nTreasure Hunter does. Here's the code from the `setup` function that\ncreates the `exit`, `player` and `treasure` sprites.\n```js\n//The exit door\nexit = g.rectangle(48, 48, \"green\");\nexit.x = 8;\nexit.y = 8;\ngameScene.addChild(exit);\n\n//The player sprite\nplayer = g.rectangle(32, 32, \"blue\");\nplayer.x = 68;\nplayer.y = g.canvas.height / 2 - player.halfHeight;\ngameScene.addChild(player);\n\n//Create the treasure\ntreasure = g.rectangle(16, 16, \"gold\");\n\n//Position it next to the left edge of the canvas\ntreasure.x = g.canvas.width - treasure.width - 10;\ntreasure.y = g.canvas.height / 2 - treasure.halfHeight;\n\n//Alternatively, you could use Ga's built in convience method\n//called `putCenter` to postion the sprite like this:\n//g.stage.putCenter(treasure, 208, 0);\n\n//Create a `pickedUp` property on the treasure to help us Figure\n//out whether or not the treasure has been picked up by the player\ntreasure.pickedUp = false;\n\n//Add the treasure to the `gameScene`\ngameScene.addChild(treasure);\n``` \nNotice that after each sprite is created, it's added to the\n`gameScene` using `addChild`. Here's what the above code produces:\n\n![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/03.png)\n\nLet's find out a little more about how these sprites are positioned on\nthe canvas.\n\n<a id='positioningsprites'></a>\n##### Positioning sprites\n\nAll sprites have `x` and `y` properties that you can use to precisely\nposition sprites on the canvas. The `x` and `y` values refer to the sprites' pixel\ncoordinates relative to the canvas's top left corner. The top\nleft corner has `x` and `y` values of 0. That means any\npositive `x` and `y` values you assign to sprites will position them left (`x`) and down\n(`y`) relative to that corner point. For example, Here's the\ncode that positions the `exit` door (the green square). \n```js\nexit.x = 8;\nexit.y = 8;\n```\nYou can see that this code places the door 8 pixel to the right and 8 pixels below the\ncanvas's top left corner. Positive `x` values position sprites to the\nright of the canvas's left edge. Positive `y` values position them\nbelow the canvas's top edge.\n\nSprites also have `width` and `height`\nproperties that tell you their width and height in pixels. If you need\nto find out what half the width or half the height of a sprite is, use\n`halfWidth` and `halfHeight`.\n\nHexi also has a some convenience methods that help you quickly position\nsprites relative to other sprites: `putTop`, `putRight`, `putBottom`, `putLeft` and `putCenter`.\nFor example, here are the lines from the code above that\nposition the treasure sprite (the gold box). The code places the\ntreasure 26 pixels to the left of the\ncanvas's right edge, and centers it vertically.\n```js\ntreasure.x = g.canvas.width - treasure.width - 10;\ntreasure.y = g.canvas.height / 2 - treasure.halfHeight;\n```\nThat's a lot of complicated positioning code to write. Instead, you\ncould use Hexi's built-in `putCenter` method to achieve the same effect\nlike this:\n```js\ng.stage.putCenter(treasure, 220, 0);\n```\nWhat is the `stage`? It's the root container for all the sprites, and\nhas exactly the same dimensions as the canvas. You can think of the\n`stage` as a big, invisible sprite, the same size as the canvas, that contains\nall the sprites in your game, as well as any containers those sprites\nmight be grouped in (Like the `gameScene`). `putCenter` works by\ncentering the `treasure` inside the `stage`, and then offsetting its\n`x` position by 220 pixels. Here's the format for using `putCenter`:\n```js\nanySprite.putCenter(anyOtherSprite, xOffset, yOffset);\n```\nYou can use the other `put` methods in the same way. For example, if\nyou wanted to position a sprite directly to the left of another\nsprite, without any offset, you could use `putLeft`, like this:\n```js\nspriteOne.putLeft(spriteTwo);\n```\nThis would place `spriteTwo` directly to the left of `spriteOne`, and\nalign it vertically .You'll see many examples of how to use these `put` methods throughout\nthese tutorials.\n\n<a id='dynamicproperties'></a>\n##### Assigning dynamic properties\n\nBefore we continue, there's one small detail you need to notice. The\ncode that creates the sprites also adds a `pickedUp` property to the\n`treasure` sprite:\n```js\ntreasure.pickedUp = false;\n```\nYou'll see how we're going to use `treasure.pickedUp` later in the game logic to help us determine the\nprogress of the game. You can dynamically assign any custom properties or methods to sprites like this, if you need to.\n\n<a id='enemysprites'></a>\n##### Creating the enemy sprites\n\nThere are 6 enemies sprites (red squares) in Treasure Hunter. They're\nspaced evenly horizontally but but have random initial vertical\npositions. All the enemies sprites are created in a `for` loop using\nthis code in the `setup` function:\n```js\n//Make the enemies\nlet numberOfEnemies = 6,\n    spacing = 48,\n    xOffset = 150,\n    speed = 2,\n    direction = 1;\n\n//An array to store all the enemies    \nenemies = [];\n\n//Make as many enemies as there are `numberOfEnemies`\nfor (let i = 0; i < numberOfEnemies; i++) {\n\n  //Each enemy is a red rectangle\n  let enemy = g.rectangle(32, 32, \"red\");\n\n  //Space each enemey horizontally according to the `spacing` value.\n  //`xOffset` determines the point from the left of the screen\n  //at which the first enemy should be added.\n  let x = spacing * i + xOffset;\n\n  //Give the enemy a random y position\n  let y = g.randomInt(0, g.canvas.height - enemy.height);\n\n  //Set the enemy's direction\n  enemy.x = x;\n  enemy.y = y;\n\n  //Set the enemy's vertical velocity. `direction` will be either `1` or\n  //`-1`. `1` means the enemy will move down and `-1` means the enemy will\n  //move up. Multiplying `direction` by `speed` determines the enemy's\n  //vertical direction\n  enemy.vy = speed * direction;\n\n  //Reverse the direction for the next enemy\n  direction *= -1;\n\n  //Push the enemy into the `enemies` array\n  enemies.push(enemy);\n\n  //Add the enemy to the `gameScene`\n  gameScene.addChild(enemy);\n}\n\n```\nHere's what this code produces:\n\n![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/04.png)\n\nThe code gives each of the enemies a random `y` position with the help\nof Hexi's `randomInt` method:\n```js\nlet y = g.randomInt(0, g.canvas.height - enemy.height);\n```\n`randomInt` will give you a random number between any two integers that you\nprovide in the arguments. (If you need a random decimal number, use\n`randomFloat` instead).\n\nAll sprites have properties called `vx` and `vy`. They determine the\nspeed and direction that the sprite will move in the horizontal\ndirection (`vx`) and vertical direction (`vy`).  The enemies in\nTreasure Hunter only move up and down, so they just need a `vy` value.\nTheir `vy` is `speed` (2) multiplied by `direction` (which will be\neither `1` or `-1`).\n```js\nenemy.vy = speed * direction;\n```\nIf `direction` is `1`, the enemy's `vy` will be `2`. That means the\nenemy will move down the screen at a rate of 2 pixels per frame. If\n`direction` is `-1`, the enemy's speed will be `-2`. That means the\nenemy will move up the screen at 2 pixels per frame. \n\nAfter the enemy's `vy` is set, `direction` is reversed so that the next\nenemy will move in the opposite direction.\n```js\ndirection *= -1;\n```\nYou can see that each enemy that's created is pushed into an array\ncalled `enemies`.\n```js\nenemies.push(enemy);\n```\nLater in the code you'll see how we'll access all the enemies in this\narray to figure out if they're touching the player.\n\n<a id='healthbar'></a>\n##### The health bar\n\nYou'll notice that when the player\ntouches one of the enemies, the width of the health bar at the top right corner of\nthe screen decreases. \n\n![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/05.png)\n\nHow was this health bar made? It's just two rectangle sprites at the same\nposition: a black rectangle behind, and a green rectangle in front. They're grouped\ntogether to make a single compound sprite called `healthBar`. The\n`healthBar` is then added to the `gameScene`.\n```js\n//Create the health bar\nlet outerBar = g.rectangle(128, 16, \"black\"),\n    innerBar = g.rectangle(128, 16, \"yellowGreen\");\n\n//Group the inner and outer bars\nhealthBar = g.group(outerBar, innerBar);\n\n//Set the `innerBar` as a property of the `healthBar`\nhealthBar.inner = innerBar;\n\n//Position the health bar\nhealthBar.x = g.canvas.width - 148;\nhealthBar.y = 16;\n\n//Add the health bar to the `gameScene`\ngameScene.addChild(healthBar);\n```\nYou can see that a property called `inner` has been added to the\n`healthBar`. It just references the `innerBar` (the green rectangle) so that\nit will be convenient to access later.\n```js\nhealthBar.inner = innerBar;\n```\nYou don't *have* to do this; but, hey why not! It means that if you\nwant to control the width of the `innerBar`, you can write some smooth code\nthat looks like this:\n```js\nhealthBar.inner.width = 30;\n```\nThat's pretty neat and readable, so we'll keep it!\n\n<a id='gameoverscene'></a>\n##### The game over scene\n\nIf the player's health drops to zero, or the player manages to\ncarry the treasure to the exit, the game ends and the game over screen\nis displayed.  The game over scene is just some text that displays \"You won!\" or \"You\nlost!\" depending on the outcome. \n\n![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/06.png)\n\nHow was this made? The text is made with a `text` sprite. \n```js\nlet anyText = g.text(\n  \"Hello!\", \"CSS font properties\", \"fillColor\", xPosition, yPosition\n);\n```\nThe first argument, \"Hello!\" in the above example, is the text content\nyou want to display. Use the `content` property to change the text\nsprite's content later.\n```js\nanyText.content = \"Some new content\";\n```\nHere's how the game over message text is created in the `setup`\nfunction. \n```js\n//Add some text for the game over message\nmessage = g.text(\"Game Over!\", \"64px Futura\", \"black\", 20, 20);\nmessage.x = 120;\nmessage.y = g.canvas.height / 2 - 64;\n```\nNext, a new `group` is created called `gameOverScene`. The `message` text\nis added to it. The `gameOverScene`'s `visible` property is set to\n`false` so that it's not visible when the game first starts.\n```js\n//Create a `gameOverScene` group and add the message sprite to it\ngameOverScene = g.group(message);\n\n//Make the `gameOverScene` invisible for now\ngameOverScene.visible = false;\n```\nAt the end of the game we'll set the `gameOverScene`'s `visible`\nproperty to `true` to display the text message. We'll also set the\n`gameScene`'s `visible` property to `false` so that all the game\nsprites are hidden.\n\n<a id='keyboard'></a>\n##### Keyboard interactivity\n\nYou control the player (the blue square) with the keyboard arrow keys.\nHexi has a built-in `arrowControl` method that lets you quickly add\narrow key interactivity to games. Supply the sprite you want to move as \nthe first argument, and the number of pixels per frame that it \nshould move as the second argument. Here's how the `arrowControl`\nmethod is used to help make the player character move 5 pixels per\nframe when the arrow keys are pressed.\n```js\ng.arrowControl(player, 5);\n```\nUsing `arrowControl` is an easy and fast way to implement keyboard\ninteractivity, but usually need finer control over what happens when\nkeys are pressed. Hexi has a built-in `keyboard` method that lets you define custom keys.\n\n```js\nlet customKey = g.keyboard(asciiCode);\n```\nSupply the [ascii key code number](http://www.asciitable.com) for key\nyou want to to use as the first argument.\n\nAll these keys have `press` and\n`release` methods that you can define. Here's how you could optionally create and use these keyboard objects to help move the player character in\nTreasure Hunter. (You would define this code in the `setup` function.):\n```js\n//Create some keyboard objects using Hexi's `keyboard` method.\n//You would usually use this code in the `setup` function.\n//Supply the ASCII key code value as the single argument\nlet leftArrow = g.keyboard(37),\n    upArrow = g.keyboard(38),\n    rightArrow = g.keyboard(39),\n    downArrow = g.keyboard(40);\n\n//Left arrow key `press` method\nleftArrow.press = () => {\n  //Change the player's velocity when the key is pressed\n  player.vx = -5;\n  player.vy = 0;\n};\n\n//Left arrow key `release` method\nleftArrow.release = () => {\n  //If the left arrow has been released, and the right arrow isn't down,\n  //and the player isn't moving vertically:\n  //Stop the player\n  if (!rightArrow.isDown && player.vy === 0) {\n    player.vx = 0;\n  }\n};\n\n//The up arrow\nupArrow.press = () => {\n  player.vy = -5;\n  player.vx = 0;\n};\nupArrow.release = () => {\n  if (!downArrow.isDown && player.vx === 0) {\n    player.vy = 0;\n  }\n};\n\n//The right arrow\nrightArrow.press = () => {\n  player.vx = 5;\n  player.vy = 0;\n};\nrightArrow.release = () => {\n  if (!leftArrow.isDown && player.vy === 0) {\n    player.vx = 0;\n  }\n};\n\n//The down arrow\ndownArrow.press = () => {\n  player.vy = 5;\n  player.vx = 0;\n};\ndownArrow.release = () => {\n  if (!upArrow.isDown && player.vx === 0) {\n    player.vy = 0;\n  }\n};\n\n```\nYou can see that the value of the player's `vx` and `vy` properties is\nchanged depending on which keys are being pressed or released.\nA positive `vx` value will make the player move right, a negative\nvalue will make it move left. A positive `vy` value will make the\nplayer move down, a negative value will make it move up. \n\nThe first argument is the sprite you want to control: `player`. The\nsecond argument is the number of pixels that the sprite should move each frame: `5`.\nThe last four arguments are the [ascii key code numbers](http://www.asciitable.com) for the top,\nright, bottom and left keys. (You can remember this because their\norder is listed clockwise, starting from the top.)\n\n\n<a id='gamestate'></a>\n##### Setting the game state\n\nThe **game state** is the function that Hexi is currently running. When\nHexi first starts, it runs the `setup` function (or whatever other\nfunction you specify in Hexi's constructor function arguments.) If you\nwant to change the game state, assign a new function to Hexi's `state`\nproperty. Here's how:\n```js\ng.state = anyFunction;\n```\nIn Treasure Hunter, when the `setup` function is finished, the game\n`state` is set to `play`:\n```js\ng.state = play;\n```\nThis makes Hexi look for and run a function called `play`. By default,\nany function assigned to the game state will run in a continuous loop, at\n60 frames per second. (You can change the frame rate at any time by setting Hexi's\n`fps` property). Game logic usually runs in a continuous loop, which\nis known as the **game loop**. Hexi handles the loop management for you,\nso you don't need to worry about how it works. \n\n(In case you're curious, Hexi uses\na `requestAnimationFrame` loop with a [fixed logic time step and variable rendering time](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html). It\nalso does sprite position interpolation to smoothe out any inconsistent\nspikes in the frame rate. It runs [Smoothie](https://github.com/kittykatattack/smoothie)\nunder-the-hood to do all this, so you can use any of Smoothie's properties to\nfine-tune your Hexi application game loops for the best possible effect.)\n\nIf you ever need to pause the loop, just use Hexi's `pause`method, like\nthis:\n```js\ng.pause();\n```\nYou can start the game loop again with the `resume` method, like this:\n```js\ng.resume();\n```\nNow let's find out how Treasure Hunter's `play` function works. \n\n<a id='gamelogic'></a>\n#### Game logic with the play function loop\n\nAs you've just learned, everything in the `play` function runs in a\ncontinuous loop.\n```js\nfunction play() {\n  //This code loops from top to bottom 60 times per second  \n}\n```\nThis is where all the game logic happens. It's the fun part,\nso let's find out what the code inside the `play` function does.\n\n<a id='movingplayer'></a>\n##### Moving the player sprite\n\nTreasure Hunter uses Hexi's `move` method inside the `play` function to move the sprites in the\ngame.\n```js\ng.move(player);\n```\nThis is the equivalent of writing code like this:\n```js\nplayer.x += player.vx;\nplayer.y += player.vy;\n```\nIt just updates the player's `x` and `y` position by adding its `vx`\nand `vy` velocity values. (Remember, those values were\nset by the key `press` and `release` methods.) Using `move` just saves\nyou from having to type-in and look-at this very standard boilerplate\ncode.\n\nYou can also move a whole array of sprites with one line of code by\nsupplying the array as the argument.\n```js\ng.move(arrayOfSprites);\n```\nSo now you can easily move the player, but what happens when the\nplayer reaches the edges of the screen?\n\n<a id='boundries'></a>\n##### Containing sprites inside the screen boundaries\n\nUse Hexi's `contain` method to keep sprites inside the boundaries of\nthe screen.\n```js\ng.contain(player, g.stage);\n```\nThe first argument is the sprite you want to contain, and the second\nargument is any JavaScript object with an `x`, `y`, `width`, and\n`height` property. \n\nAs you learnt earlier, `stage` is the root container object for all Hexi's sprites, and it has\nthe same width and height as the `canvas`. \n\nBut you can alternatively supply the `contain` method with a custom \nobject to do the same thing. Here's how:\n\n```js\ng.contain(\n  player, \n  {\n    x: 0,\n    y: 0,\n    width: 512,\n    height: 512\n  }\n);\n```\nThis will contain the `player` sprite to an area defined by the\ndimensions of the object. This is really convenient if you want to\nprecisely fine-tune the area in which the object should be contained.\n\n`contain` has an extra useful feature. If the sprite reaches one of\nthe containment edges, `contain` will return a [JavaScript Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) that tells you\nwhich edge it reached: \"top\", \"right\", \"bottom\", or \"left\". Here's how\nyou could use this feature to find out which edge of the canvas the\nsprite is touching:\n\n```js\nlet playerHitsEdges = g.contain(player, g.stage);\n\nif(playerHitsEdges) {\n\n  //Find out on which side the collision happened\n  let collisionSide;\n  if (playerHitsEdges.has(\"left\")) collisionSide = \"left\";\n  if (playerHitsEdges.has(\"right\")) collisionSide = \"right\";\n  if (playerHitsEdges.has(\"top\")) collisionSide = \"top\";\n  if (playerHitsEdges.has(\"bottom\")) collisionSide = \"bottom\";\n\n  //Display the result in a text sprite\n  message.content = `The player hit the ${collisionSide} of the canvas`; \n} \n```\n<a id='collisionenemy'></a>\n##### Collision with the enemies\n\nWhen the player hits any of the enemies, the width of the health bar\ndecreases and the player becomes semi-transparent.\n\n![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/07.png)\n\nHow does this work?\n\nHexi has a full suite of useful 2D geometric and tile-based collision\ndetection methods. Hexi implements the [Bump collision module](https://github.com/kittykatattack/bump) so all\nof Bump's collision methods work with Hexi. \n\nTreasure Hunter only uses one of these collision methods:\n`hitTestRectangle`. It takes two rectangular sprites and tells you\nwhether they're overlapping. It will return `true` if they are, and\n`false` if they aren't.\n```js\ng.hitTestRectangle(spriteOne, spriteTwo);\n```\nHere's how the code in the `play` function uses `hitTestRectangle` to\ncheck for a collision between any of the enemies and the player.\n```js\n//Set `playerHit` to `false` before checking for a collision\nlet playerHit = false;\n\n//Loop through all the sprites in the `enemies` array\nenemies.forEach(enemy => {\n\n  //Move the enemy\n  g.move(enemy);\n\n  //Check the enemy's screen boundaries\n  let enemyHitsEdges = g.contain(enemy, g.stage);\n\n  //If the enemy hits the top or bottom of the stage, reverse\n  //its direction\n  if (enemyHitsEdges) {\n    if (enemyHitsEdges.has(\"top\") || enemyHitsEdges.has(\"bottom\")) {\n      enemy.vy *= -1;\n    }\n  }\n\n  //Test for a collision. If any of the enemies are touching\n  //the player, set `playerHit` to `true`\n  if (g.hitTestRectangle(player, enemy)) {\n   playerHit = true;\n  }\n});\n\n//If the player is hit...\nif (playerHit) {\n\n  //Make the player semi-transparent\n  player.alpha = 0.5;\n\n  //Reduce the width of the health bar's inner rectangle by 1 pixel\n  healthBar.inner.width -= 1;\n} else {\n\n  //Make the player fully opaque (non-transparent) if it hasn't been hit\n  player.alpha = 1;\n}\n```\nThis bit of code creates a variable called `playerHit`, which is\ninitialized to `false` just before the `forEach` loop checks all the\nenemies for a collision.\n```js\nlet playerHit = false;\n```\n(Because the `play` function runs 60 times per second, `playerHit`\nwill be reinitialized to `false` on every new frame.)\n\nIf `hitTestRectangle` returns `true`, the `forEach` loop sets\n`playerHit` to `true`.\n```js\nif(g.hitTestRectangle(player, enemy)) {\n  playerHit = true;\n}\n```\nIf the player has been hit, the code makes the player semi-transparent by\nsetting its `alpha` value to 0.5. It also reduces the width of the\n`healthBar`'s `inner` sprite by 1 pixel.\n```js\nif(playerHit) {\n\n  //Make the player semi-transparent\n  player.alpha = 0.5;\n\n  //Reduce the width of the health bar's inner rectangle by 1 pixel\n  healthBar.inner.width -= 1;\n\n} else {\n\n  //Make the player fully opaque (non-transparent) if it hasn't been hit\n  player.alpha = 1;\n}\n```\nYou can set the `alpha` property of sprites to any value between `0`\n(fully transparent) to `1` (fully opaque). A value of `0.5` makes it\nsemi-transparent.b (**Alpha** is a\nwell-worn graphic design term that just means **transparency**.)\n\nThis bit of code also uses the `move` method to move the enemies, and\n`contain` to keep them contained inside the canvas. The code also uses\nthe return value of `contain` to find out if the enemy is hitting the\ntop or bottom of the canvas. If it hits the top or bottom, the enemy's direction is\nreversed with the help of this code:\n```js\n//Check the enemy's screen boundaries\nlet enemyHitsEdges = g.contain(enemy, g.stage);\n\n//If the enemy hits the top or bottom of the stage, reverse\n//its direction\nif (enemyHitsEdges) {\n  if (enemyHitsEdges.has(\"top\") || enemyHitsEdges.has(\"bottom\")) {\n    enemy.vy *= -1;\n  }\n}\n```\nMultiplying the enemy's `vy` (vertical velocity) value by negative 1\nmakes it go in the opposite direction. It's a really simple **bounce**\neffect.\n\n<a id='collisiontreasure'></a>\n###### Collision with the treasure\n\nIf the player touches the treasure (the yellow square), the `chimes`\nsound plays. The player can then\ncarry the treasure to the exit. The treasure is centered over the player and\nmoves along with it. \n\n![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/08.png)\n\nHere's the code from the `play` function that achieves these effects.\n\n```js\n//Check for a collision between the player and the treasure\nif (g.hitTestRectangle(player, treasure)) {\n\n  //If the treasure is touching the player, center it over the player\n  treasure.x = player.x + 8;\n  treasure.y = player.y + 8;\n\n  if(!treasure.pickedUp) {\n\n    //If the treasure hasn't already been picked up,\n    //play the `chimes` sound\n    chimes.play();\n    treasure.pickedUp = true;\n  };\n}\n```\nYou can see that the code uses `hitTestRectangle` inside an `if`\nstatement to test for a collision between the player and the treasure.\n```js\nif (g.hitTestRectangle(player, treasure)) {\n```\nIf it's `true`, the treasure is centered over the player.\n```js\ntreasure.x = player.x + 8;\ntreasure.y = player.y + 8;\n```\nIf `treasure.pickedUp` is `false`, then you know that the treasure hasn't already been \npicked up, and you can play the `chimes` sound:\n```js\nchimes.play();\n```\nIn addition to `play` Hexi's sound objects also have a few more methods that you can use to control them:\n`pause`, `restart` and `playFrom`. (Use `playFrom` to start playing\nthe sound from a specific second in the sound file, like this:\n`soundObject.playFrom(5)`. This will make the sound start playing from\nthe 5 second mark.)\n\nYou can also set the sound object's `volume` by assigning\na value between 0 and 1. Here's how to set the `volume` to mid-level\n(50%).\n```js\nsoundObject.volume = 0.5;\n```\nYou can set the sound object's `pan` by assigning a value between -1 (left speaker)\nto 1 (right speaker). A pan value of 0 makes the sound equal volume in\nboth speakers. Here's how you could set the `pan` to be slightly more\nprominent in the left speaker.\n```js\nsoundObject.pan = -0.2;\n```\nIf you want to make a sound repeat continuously, set its `loop` property to `true`.\n```js\nsoundObject.loop = true;\n```\nHexi implements the [Sound.js module](https://github.com/kittykatattack/sound.js) to control sounds, so you\ncan use any of Sound.js's properties and methods in your Hexi\napplications.\n\nBecause you don't want to play the `chimes` sound more than once after\nthe treasure has been picked up, the code sets `treasure.pickedUp` to\n`true` just after the sound plays.\n```js\ntreasure.pickedUp = true;\n```\nNow that the player has picked up the treasure, how can you check for\nthe end of the game?\n\n<a id='endinggame1'></a>\n##### Ending the game\n\nThere are two ways the game can end. The player's health can run out,\nin which case the game is lost. Or, the player can successfully carry\nthe treasure to the exit, in which case the game is won. If either of\nthese two conditions are met,  the game's `state` is set to `end` and\nthe `message` text's `content` displays the outcome. Here's the last\nbit of code in the `play` function that does this:\n```js\n//Does the player have enough health? If the width of the `innerBar`\n//is less than zero, end the game and display \"You lost!\"\nif (healthBar.inner.width < 0) {\n  g.state = end;\n  message.content = \"You lost!\";\n}\n\n//If the player has brought the treasure to the exit,\n//end the game and display \"You won!\"\nif (g.hitTestRectangle(treasure, exit)) {\n  g.state = end;\n  message.content = \"You won!\";\n}\n```\nThe `end` function is really simple. It just hides the `gameScene` and\ndisplays the `gameOverScene`.\n```js\nfunction end() {\n  gameScene.visible = false;\n  gameOverScene.visible = true;\n}\n```\nAnd that's it for Treasure Hunter! Before you continue, try making\nyour own game from scratch using some of these same techniques. When\nyou're ready, read on!\n\n<a id='usingimages'></a>\n### Using images\n\nThere are three main ways you can use images in your Hexi games. \n\n- Use individual image files for each sprite.\n- Use a **texture atlas**. This is a single image file that includes\n  sub-images for each sprite in your game. The image file is\n  accompanied by a matching JSON\n  data file that describes the name, size and location of each\n  sub-image.\n- Use a **tileset** (also known as a **spritesheet**). This is also a single\n  image file that includes sub-images for each sprite. However, unlike a\n  texture atlas, it doesn't come with a JSON file describing the\n  sprite data. Instead, you need to specify the size and location of\n  each sprite in your game code with JavaScript. This can have some\n  advantages over a texture atlas in certain circumstances.\n\nAll three ways of making image sprites use Hexi's `sprite` method.\nHere's the simplest way of using it to make an image sprite.\n```js\nlet imageSprite = g.sprite(\"images/theSpriteImage.png\");\n```\nIn this next section we'll update Treasure Hunter with image sprites, and\nyou'll learn all three ways of adding images to your games.\n\n(All the images in this section were created by Lanea Zimmerman. You\ncan find more of her artwork [here](http://opengameart.org/users/sharm). Thanks, Lanea!)\n\n<a id='individualimages'></a>\n#### Individual images\n\nOpen and play the next version of Treasure Hunter:\n`02_treasureHunterImages.html` (you'll find it in the `tutorials`\nfolder.) It plays exactly the same as the first version, but all the\ncolored squares have been replaced by images.\n\n[![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/09.png)](https://cdn.gitcdn.xyz/cdn/kittykatattack/hexi/7349658f295c120ca7f3bab94d31379a0c02952e/tutorials/02_treasureHunterImages.html)\n\n(Click the image and follow the link to play the game.) Take a look at the source code, and you'll notice that the game logic\nand structure is exactly the same as the first version of the game.\nThe only thing that's changed is the appearance of the sprites.\nHow was this done?\n\n<a id='loadingimagefile'></a>\n##### Loading image files \n\nEach sprite in the game uses an individual PNG image file. You'll find\nall the images in the tutorials' `images` sub-folder.\n\n![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/10.png)\n\nBefore you can use them to make sprites, you need to pre-load them into\nHexi's `assets`. The easiest way to do this is to list the image names,\nwith their full file paths, in Hexi's assets array when you first\ninitialize the engine. Create an array called `thingsToLoad`, list the\nfile names, as strings, that you want to load. Then supply that array\nas the `hexi` method's fourth argument. Here's how:\n```js\n//An array that contains all the files you want to load\nlet thingsToLoad = [\n  \"images/explorer.png\",\n  \"images/dungeon.png\",\n  \"images/blob.png\",\n  \"images/treasure.png\",\n  \"images/door.png\",\n  \"sounds/chimes.wav\"\n];\n\n//Create a new Hexi instance, and start it\nlet g = hexi(512, 512, setup, thingsToLoad);\n\n//Start Hexi\ng.start();\n```\n(If you open up the JavaScript console in the web browser, you can\nmonitor the loading progress of these assets.)\n\nNow you can access any of these images in your game code like this:\n```js\ng.image(\"images/blob.png\")\n```\nAlthough pre-loading the images and other assets is the simplest way\nto get them into your game, you can also load assets at any other time\nusing the `loader` object and its methods. As I mentioned earlier,\nthe `loader` is just an alias for Pixi's loader that's running\nunder-the-hood, and you can [learn more about how to use it here](https://github.com/kittykatattack/learningPixi#loading).\n\nNow that you've loaded the images into the game, let's find out how to\nuse them to make sprites.\n\n<a id='makingsprites'></a>\n##### Making sprites with images\n\nCreate an image sprite using the `sprite` method using the same format you learnt\nearlier. Here's how to create a sprite using the `dungeon.png` image.\n(`dungeon.png` is a 512 by 512 pixel background image.)\n```js\ndungeon = g.sprite(\"images/dungeon.png\");\n```\nThat's all! Now instead of displaying as a simple colored rectangle,\nthe sprite will be displayed as a 512 by 512 image. There's no need\nto specify the width or height, because Hexi figures that our for you\nautomatically based on the size of the image. You can use all the other\nsprite properties, like `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height`, just as you\nwould with ordinary rectangle sprites. \n\nHere's the code from the `setup` function that creates the dungeon\nbackground, exit door, player and treasure, and adds them all to the\n`gameScene` group. \n```js\n//The dungeon background\ndungeon = g.sprite(\"images/dungeon.png\");\n\n//The exit door\nexit = g.sprite(\"images/door.png\");\nexit.x = 32;\n\n//The player sprite\nplayer = g.sprite(\"images/explorer.png\");\nplayer.x = 68;\nplayer.y = g.canvas.height / 2 - player.halfWidth;\n\n//Create the treasure\ntreasure = g.sprite(\"images/treasure.png\");\n\n//Position it next to the left edge of the canvas\n//g.stage.putCenter(treasure, 208, 0);\n\n//Create a `pickedUp` property on the treasure to help us Figure\n//out whether or not the treasure has been picked up by the player\ntreasure.pickedUp = false;\n\n//Create the `gameScene` group and add the sprites\ngameScene = g.group(dungeon, exit, player, treasure);\n```\n(As a slightly more efficient improvement to the\noriginal version of this code, `group` creates the `gameScene` and groups\nthe sprites in a single step.)\n\nLook familiar? That's right, the only code that has changed are the\nlines that create the sprites. This modularity is a feature of Hexi that lets you create quick\ngame prototypes using simple shapes that you can easily swap out for\ndetailed images as your game ideas develops. The rest of the code in the\ngame can remain as-is.\n\n<a id='finetuning'></a>\n##### Fine-tuning the containment area\n\nOne small improvement that was made to this new version Treasure\nHunter is the new way that the sprites are contained inside the walls of the\ndungeon. They're contained in such a way that naturally matches the 2.5D perspective of the artwork, as shown by the green square in this screen shot:\n\n![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/11.png)\n\nThis is a very easy modification to make. All you need to do is supply\nthe `contain` method with a custom object that defines the size and\nposition of the containing rectangle. Here's how:\n```js\ng.contain(\n  player,\n  {\n    x: 32, y: 16,\n    width: g.canvas.width - 32,\n    height: g.canvas.height - 32\n  }\n);\n```\nJust tweak the `x`, `y`, `width` and `height` values so that the\ncontaining area looks natural for the game you're making.\n\n<a id='textureatlas'></a>\n#### Using a texture atlas\n\nIf you\u2019re working on a big, complex game, you\u2019ll want a fast and\nefficient way to work with images. A texture atlas can help you do\nthis. A texture atlas is actually two separate files that are closely\nrelated:\n\n- A single PNG **tileset** image file that contains all the images you\n  want to use in your game. (A tileset image is sometimes called a\n  spritesheet.)\n-\tA JSON file that describes the size and position of those sub-images\n  in the tileset.\n\nUsing a texture atlas is a big time saver. You can arrange the\ntileset\u2019s sub-images in any order and the JSON file will keep\ntrack of their sizes and positions for you. This is really convenient\nbecause it means the sizes and positions of the sub-images aren\u2019t\nhard-coded into your game program. If you make changes to the tileset,\nlike adding images, resizing them, or removing them, just re-publish\nthe JSON file and your game will use that updated data to display the\nimages correctly. If you\u2019re going to be making anything bigger than a\nvery small game, you\u2019ll definitely want to use a texture atlas.\n\nThe de-facto standard for tileset JSON data is the format that is\noutput by a popular software tool called [Texture Packer](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker) (Texture Packer's \"Essential\" license is free ). Even if you\ndon\u2019t use Texture Packer, similar tools like [Shoebox](http://renderhjs.net/shoebox/) output JSON files in the same format. Let\u2019s find out how to use it to make a texture\natlas with Texture Packer, and how to load it into a game.\n\n<a id='preparingimages'></a>\n##### Preparing the images\n\nYou first need individual PNG images for each image in your game.\nYou've already got them for Treasure Hunter, so you're all set. Open Texture\nPacker and choose the **{JS}** configuration option. Drag your game images\ninto its workspace. You can also point Texture Packer to any folder that contains\nyour images. Texture Packer will automatically arrange the images on a\nsingle tileset image, and give them names that match their original\nimage file names. It will give them a 2 pixel padding by default.\n\n![Texture Packer](/tutorials/screenshots/12.png)\n\nEach of the sub-images in the atlas is called a **frame**. Although\nit's just one big image, the texture atlas has 5 frames. The name of each\nframe is the same its original PNG file name: \"dungeon.png\",\n\"blob.png\", \"explorer.png\", \"treasure.png\" and \"door.png\". These\nframes names are used to help the atlas reference each sub-image.\n\nWhen you\u2019re done, make sure the Data Format is set to JSON (Hash) and\nclick the Publish button. Choose the file name and location, and save the\npublished files. You\u2019ll end up with a PNG file and a JSON file. In\nthis example my file names are `treasureHunter.json` and\n`treasureHunter.png`. To make\nyour life easier, just keep both files in your project\u2019s `images`\nfolder. (Think of the JSON file as extra metadata for the image file.)\n\nTexture Packer can often be a pain to use, because you need to get all\nthese settings just right for it to publish properly without telling\nyou there are errors. And, it will try to trick you into upgrading to\nthe paid version by using default settings not supported by the free\nversion. So you need to explicitly turn these off (as I've described\nabove) for it to work without errors. Still, it's worth the effort in\nthe end - so keep trying and post an issue in this repository if you\nget impossibly stuck!\n\n<a id='loadingatlas'></a>\n##### loading the texture atlas\n\nTo load the texture atlas into your game, just include the JSON file\nin Hexi's assets array when you initialize the game.\n```js\nlet thingsToLoad = [\n  \"images/treasureHunter.json\",\n  \"sounds/chimes.wav\"\n];\nlet g = hexi(512, 512, setup, thingsToLoad);\ng.scaleToWindow();\ng.start();\n```\nThat's all! You don't have to load the PNG file - Hexi does that\nautomatically in the background. The JSON file is all you need to tell\nHexi which tileset frame (sub-image) to display.\n\nNow if you want to use a frame from the texture atlas to make a\nsprite, you can do it like this:\n```js\nanySprite = g.sprite(\"frameName.png\");\n```\nGa will create the sprite and display the correct image from the\ntexture atlas's tileset.\n\nHere's how to you could create the sprites in Treasure Hunter using\ntexture atlas frames:\n```js\n//The dungeon background\ndungeon = g.sprite(\"dungeon.png\");\n\n//The exit door\nexit = g.sprite(\"door.png\");\nexit.x = 32;\n\n//The player sprite\nplayer = g.sprite(\"explorer.png\");\nplayer.x = 68;\nplayer.y = g.canvas.height / 2 - player.halfWidth;\n\n//Create the treasure\ntreasure = g.sprite(\"treasure.png\");\n```\nHexi knows that those are texture atlas frame names, not individual\nimages, and it displays them directly from the tileset.\n\nIf you ever need to access the texture atlas's JSON file in your game,\nyou can get it like this:\n```js\njsonFile = g.json(\"jsonFileName.json\");\n```\nTake a look at `treasureHunterAtlas.js` file in the `tutorials` folder\nto see a working example of how to load a texture atlas and use it to\nmake sprites.\n\n<a id='alienarmada'></a>\n### Alien Armada\n\nThe next example game in this series of tutorials is Alien Armada. Can you\ndestroy 60 aliens before one of them lands and destroys the Earth? Click the\nimage link below to play the game:\n\n[![Alien Armada](/tutorials/screenshots/13.png)](https://gitcdn.xyz/repo/kittykatattack/hexi/master/tutorials/04_alienArmada.html)\n\nUse the arrow keys to move and press the space bar to shoot. The\naliens descend from the top of the screen with\nincreasing frequency as the game progresses. Here's how the game is played:\n\n![Alien Armada gameplay](/tutorials/screenshots/14.png)\n\nAlien Armada illustrates some new techniques that you'll definitely want\nto use in your games:\n\n- Load and use custom fonts.\n- Display a loading progress bar while the game assets load.\n- Shoot bullets.\n- Create sprites with multiple image states.\n- Generate random enemies.\n- Remove sprites from a game.\n- Display a game score.\n- Reset and restart a game.\n\nYou'll find the fully commented Alien Armada source code in the\n`tutorials` folder. Make sure to take a look at it so that you can see\nall of this code in its proper context. Its general structure is identical\nto Treasure Hunter, with the addition of these new techniques. Let's\nfind out how they were implemented.\n\n<a id='customfonts'></a>\n#### Load and use a custom font\n\nAlien Armada uses a custom font called `emulogic.ttf` to display the\nscore at the top right corner of the screen. The font file is\npreloaded with the rest of the asset files (sounds and images) in the assets array that\ninitializes the game. \n```js\nlet thingsToLoad = [\n  \"images/alienArmada.json\",\n  \"sounds/explosion.mp3\",\n  \"sounds/music.mp3\",\n  \"sounds/shoot.mp3\",\n  \"fonts/emulogic.ttf\" //<- The custom font\n];\nlet g = hexi(480, 320, setup, thingsToLoad, load);\ng.scaleToWindow();\ng.start();\n```\nTo use the font, create a `text` sprite in the game's `setup`\nfunction. The `text` method's second argument is a\nstring that describes the font's point size and name: \"20px emulogic\".  \n```js\nscoreDisplay = g.text(\"0\", \"20px emulogic\", \"#00FF00\", 400, 10);\n```\nYou can and load and use any fonts in TTF, OTF, TTC or WOFF format.\n\n<a id='progressbar'></a>\n#### A loading progress bar\n\nAlien Armada loads three MP3 sound files: a shooting sound, an\nexplosion sound, and music. The music sound is about 2 MB in size so\non a slow network connection this sound could take a few seconds to\nload. While this is happening players would just see the blank canvas while Alien Armada\nloads. Some players might think the game has frozen, so the game\nhelpfully implements a loading bar to inform\nplayers that the assets are loading. It's a blue rectangle that expands from left to right, and\ndisplays a number that tells you the percentage of game assets\nloaded so far.\n\n![Loading progress bar](/tutorials/screenshots/16.png)\n\nThis is a feature that's built into the Hexi engine. \nHexi has a optional loading state that runs while game assets are being\nloaded. You can decide what you want to have happen during the loading\nstate. All you need to do is write a function with code that should\nrun while the assets are loading, and tell Hexi what the name of that\nfunction is. Hexi's engine will automatically run that function in a\nloop until the assets have finished loading.\n\nLet's find out how this works in Alien Armada. The game code tells \nHexi to use a function called `load` during the loading state. It does\nthis by listing `load` as the final argument\nin Hexi's initialization constructor. (Look for `load` in the code below):\n```js\nlet g = hexi(480, 320, setup, thingsToLoad, load); //<- It's here!\n```\nThis tells Hexi to run the `load` function in a loop while the assets\nare loading. \n\nHere's the `load` function from Alien Armada. It implements a\n`loadingBar` object, which is what displays the expanding blue bar and\nthe percentage of files loaded.\n```js\nfunction load(){\n  g.loadingBar();\n}\n\n```\nAfter the assets have loaded, the `setup` state runs automatically. \n\nYou'll find the `loadingBar` code in Hexi's the `core.js` file. It's\nmeant to be a very simple example that you can use as the basis for\nwriting your own custom loading animation, if you want to. You can run any code you\nlike in the `load` function, so it's entirely up to you to decide what\nshould happen or what is displayed while your game is loading.\n\n<a id='shootingbullets'></a>\n#### Shooting bullets\n\nHow can you make the cannon fire bullets? \n\nWhen you press the space bar, the cannon fires bullets at the enemies.\nThe bullets start from the end of the cannon's turret, and travel up the\ncanvas at 7 pixels per frame. If they hit an alien, the alien\nexplodes. If a bullet misses and flies past the top of the stage, the\ngame code removes it.\n\n![Firing bullets](/tutorials/screenshots/17.png)\n\nTo implement a bullet-firing system in your game, the first thing you\nneed is an array to store the all the bullet sprites.\n```js\nbullets = [];\n```\nThis `bullets` array is initialized in the game's `setup` function.\n\nYou can then use Hexi's custom `shoot` method to make any sprite fire\nbullets in any direction. Here's the general format you can use to\nimplement the `shoot` method.\n```js\ng.shoot(\n  cannon,            //The shooter\n  4.71,              //The angle at which to shoot (4.71 is up)\n  cannon.halfWidth,  //Bullet's x position on the cannon\n  0,                 //Bullet's y position on the canon\n  g.stage,           //The container to which the bullet should be added\n  7,                 //The bullet's speed (pixels per frame)\n  bullets,           //The array used to store the bullets\n\n  //A function that returns the sprite that should\n  //be used to make each bullet\n  () => g.sprite(\"bullet.png\")\n);\n```\nThe second argument determines the angle, in radians, at which the\nbullet should travel. 4.71 radians, used in this example, is up. 0 is\nto the right, 1.57 is down, and 3.14 is to the left. \n\nThe 3rd and 4th arguments are the bullet's start x and y position on\nthe canon. The 5th argument is the container that the bullet should be\nadded to, and the 6th is the array that the bullets should be put\ninto.\n\nThe last argument is a function that returns a sprite that should be\nused as the bullet. In this example the bullet is created using using the \n\"bullet.png\" frame from the game's loaded texture atlas.\n```js\n() => g.sprite(\"bullet.png\")\n```\nReplace this function with your own to create any kind of custom\nbullet you might need.\n\nWhen will your bullets be fired? You can call the `shoot` method\nwhenever you want to make bullets, at any point in your code. In Alien\nArmada, bullets are fired when the player presses the space bar. So\nthe game implements this by calling `shoot` inside the space bar's\n`press` method. Here's how:\n```js\ng.spaceBar.press = () => {\n\n  //Shoot the bullet\n  g.shoot(\n    cannon,            //The shooter\n    4.71,              //The angle at which to shoot (4.71 is up)\n    cannon.halfWidth,  //Bullet's x position on the cannon\n    0,                 //Bullet's y position on the canon\n    g.stage,           //The container to which the bullet should be added\n    7,                 //The bullet's speed (pixels per frame)\n    bullets,           //The array used to store the bullets\n\n    //A function that returns the sprite that should\n    //be used to make each bullet\n    () => g.sprite(\"bullet.png\")\n  );\n\n  //Play the shoot sound.\n  shootSound.play();\n};\n```\nYou can see that the `press` method also makes the `shootSound` play.\n(The code above is initialized in the game's `setup` function.)\n\nThere's one more thing you need to do: you have to make the bullets move.\nYou can do this with some code inside the game's looping `play` function. Use Hexi's\n`move` method and supply the `bullets` array as an argument:\n```js\ng.move(bullets);\n```\nThe `move` method automatically loops through all the sprites in the\narray and updates their x and y positions with the value of their `vx` and `vy` velocity values.\n\nSo now you know how the bullets are created and animated. But what happens when\nthey hit one of the aliens?\n\n<a id='spritestates'></a>\n#### Sprite states\n\nWhen a bullet hits an alien, a yellow explosion image appears. This\nsimple effect is created by giving each alien sprite two states: a `normal`\nstate and a `destroyed` state. Aliens are created with their states\nset to `normal`. If they're hit, their states change to `destroyed`.\n\n![The sprite's states](/tutorials/screenshots/18.png)\n\nHow does this system work?\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the Alien Armada tileset, shown here:\n\n![The Alien Armada tileset](/tutorials/screenshots/19.png)\n\nYou can see two image frames that define these two states: `alien.png`\nand `explosion.png`. Before you create the sprite, first create an\narray that lists these two frames: \n```js\nlet alienFrames = [\n  \"alien.png\", \n  \"explosion.png\"\n];\n```\nNext use the `alienFrames` array to initialize the `alien` sprite.\n```js\nalien = g.sprite(alienFrames);\n```\nIf you prefer, you could combine these two steps into one, like this:\n```js\nalien = g.sprite([\n  \"alien.png\", \n  \"explosion.png\"\n]);\n```\nThis loads the sprite up with two frames. Frame `0` is the `alien.png`\nframe, and frame `1` is the `explosion.png` frame. Frame `0` is\ndisplayed by default by when the sprite is first created. \n\nYou can use the sprite's `show` method to display any other frame number on the\nsprite, like this:\n```js\nalien.show(1);\n```\nThe code above will set the alien to frame number one, which is the\n`explosion.png` frame.\n\nTo make your code a little more readable, its a good idea to define\nyour sprite's states in a special `states` object. Give each state a\nname, with a value that corresponds to that state's frame number.\nHere's how you could define two states on the alien: `normal` and\n`destroyed`:\n```js\nalien.states = {\n  normal: 0,\n  destroyed: 1\n};\n```\n`alien.states.normal` now has the value `0`, and\n`alien.states.destroyed` now has the value `1`. That means you could\ndisplay the alien's `normal` state like this:\n```js\nalien.show(alien.states.normal);\n```\nAnd display the alien's `destroyed` state like this:\n```js\nalien.show(alien.states.destroyed);\n```\nThis makes your code a little more readable because you can tell at a\nglance which sprite state is being displayed.\n\n(Note: Hexi also has a lower-level `gotoAndStop` method that does\nexactly the same thing as `show`. Although you're free use `gotoAndStop` in your\ngame code, by convention it's only used internally by Hexi's rendering\nengine.)\n\n<a id='randomaliens'></a>\n#### Generating random aliens\n\nAlien Armada generates aliens at any 1 of 14 randomly chosen positions\njust above the top boundary of the stage. The aliens first appear\ninfrequently, but gradually start to appear at an ever-increasing rate. This makes the game gradually more difficult as it progresses. Let's find out how these two features are implemented.\n\n<a id='timingaliens'></a>\n##### Timing the aliens\n\nWhen the game starts, the first new alien is generated after 100\nframes have elapsed. A variable called `alienFrequency`, initialized in\nthe game's `setup` function is used to help track this. it's\ninitialized to 100.\n```js\nalienFrequency = 100;\n```\nAnother variable called `alienTimer` is used to count the number of\nof frames that have elapsed between the previously generated alien,\nand the next one. \n```js\nalienTimer = 0;\n```\n`alienTimer` is updated by 1 each frame in the `play` function (the game loop).\nWhen `alienTimer` reaches the value of `alienFrequency`, a new alien\nsprite is generated. Here's the code from the `play` function that\ndoes this. (This code omits the actual code that generates the alien\nsprite - we'll look at that ahead)\n```js\n//Add one to the alienTimer\nalienTimer++;\n\n//Make a new alien if `alienTimer` equals the `alienFrequency`\nif(alienTimer === alienFrequency) {\n\n  //... Create the alien: see ahead for the missing code that does this...\n\n  //Set the `alienTimer` back to zero\n  alienTimer = 0;\n\n  //Reduce `alienFrequency` by one to gradually increase\n  //the frequency that aliens are created\n  if(alienFrequency > 2){  \n    alienFrequency--;\n  }\n}\n```\nYou can see in the code above that `alienFrequency` is reduced by 1\nafter the sprite has been created. That will make the next alien appear 1 frame earlier than the\nprevious alien, and which is why the rate of falling aliens slowly\nincreases. You can also see that the `alienTimer` is set back to 0 after the sprite\nhas been created so that it can restart counting towards making\nthe next new alien. \n\n<a id='randomposition'></a>\n##### The aliens' random start positions\n\nBefore we generate any aliens, we need an array to store all the alien\nsprites. An empty array called `aliens` is initialized in the `setup`\nfunction for this purpose.\n```js\naliens = [];\n```\nEach alien is then created in the `play` function, inside the same\n`if` statement we looked at above. This code has a lot of work to do:\n\n- It sets the alien's image frames and states. \n- Its sets the alien's velocity (`vx` and `vy`.) \n- It positions the alien at a random horizontal position above the top stage boundary.\n- And, finally, it pushes the alien into the `aliens` array. \n\nHere's the full code that does all this:\n```js\n//Add one to the alienTimer\nalienTimer++;\n\n//Make a new alien if `alienTimer` equals the `alienFrequency`\nif(alienTimer === alienFrequency) {\n\n  //Create the alien.\n  //Assign two frames from the texture atlas as the \n  //alien's two states\n  let alienFrames = [\n    \"alien.png\", \n    \"explosion.png\"\n  ];\n\n  //Initialize the alien sprite with the frames\n  let alien = g.sprite(alienFrames);\n\n  //Define some states on the alien that correspond\n  //to its two frames.\n  alien.states = {\n    normal: 0,\n    destroyed: 1\n  };\n  \n  //Set its y position above the screen boundary\n  alien.y = 0 - alien.height;\n  \n  //Assign the alien a random x position\n  alien.x = g.randomInt(0, 14) * alien.width;\n  \n  //Set its speed\n  alien.vy = 1;\n  \n  //Push the alien into the `aliens` array\n  aliens.push(alien);\n\n  //Set the `alienTimer` back to zero\n  alienTimer = 0;\n\n  //Reduce `alienFrequency` by one to gradually increase\n  //the frequency that aliens are created\n  if(alienFrequency > 2){  \n    alienFrequency--;\n  }\n}\n```\nYou can see in the code above that the alien's `y` position places it\nout of sight just above the stage's top boundary.\n```js\nalien.y = 0 - alien.height;\n```\nIt's `x` position, however, is random. \n```js\nalien.x = g.randomInt(0, 14) * alien.width;\n```\nThis code places it in one of 15 possible random positions (0 to 14) above the\ntop of the stage. Here's an illustration of these positions:\n\n![The Alien Armada tileset](/tutorials/screenshots/20.png)\n\nFinally, and very importantly, the code pushes the alien sprite into\nthe `aliens` array.\n```js\naliens.push(alien);\n```\nAll this code starts pumping out aliens at a steadily increasing rate.\n\n<a id='movingaliens'></a>\n#### Moving the aliens\n\nHow do we make the aliens move? In exactly the same way made the\nbullets move. You'll notice in the code above that\neach alien is initialized with a `vy` (vertical velocity) value of 1.\n```js\nalien.vy = 1;\n```\nWhen this value is applied to the alien's `y` position, it will make the alien move down, towards the bottom of the stage,\nat the rate of 1 pixel per frame. All the alien sprites in the game are in\nthe `aliens` array. So to make all of them move you need to loop\nthrough each sprite in the `aliens` array each frame and add their\n`vy` values to their `y` positions. Some code like this in the `play`\nfunction would work:\n```js\naliens.forEach(alien => {\n  alien.y += alien.vy;\n});\n```\nHowever, its easier just to use Hexi's convenient built-in `move` function. Just\nsupply `move` with the array of sprites that you want to move, like\nthis:\n```js\ng.move(aliens);\n```\nThis updates the aliens positions with their velocities automatically.\n\n<a id='explodealiens'></a>\n#### Making the aliens explode\n\nNow that you know how to change the alien's state, how can you use\nthis skill to create the explosion effect? Here's the simplified code\nfrom Alien Armada that shows you how to do this. Use `hitTestRectangle` to\ncheck for a collision between an alien and bullet. If a collision is detected,\nremove the bullet, show the alien's `destroyed` state, and then remove\nthe alien after a delay of one second.\n```js\nif (g.hitTestRectangle(alien, bullet)) {\n\n  //Remove the bullet sprite.\n  g.remove(bullet);\n\n  //Show the alien's `destroyed` state.\n  alien.show(alien.states.destroyed);\n\n  //Wait for 1 second (1000 milliseconds) then \n  //remove the alien sprite.\n  g.wait(1000, () => g.remove(alien));\n}\n```\nYou can use Hexi's universal `remove` function to remove any sprite from a game, like this:\n```js\ng.remove(anySprite);\n```\nYou can optionally use it to remove more than one sprite at a time by\nlisting the sprites to remove in the arguments, like this:\n```js\ng.remove(spriteOne, spriteTwo, spriteThree);\n```\nYou can even use it to remove all the sprites in an array of sprites. Just\nsupply the sprite array as `remove`'s only argument:\n```js\ng.remove(arrayOfSprites);\n```\nThis will both make the sprites disappear from the screen, and also\nempty them out of the array that they were in.\n\nHexi also has a convenient method called `wait` that will run a function\nafter any delay (in milliseconds) that you specify. The Alien Armada\ngame code uses `wait` to remove the alien after a one second delay,\nlike this:\n```js\ng.wait(1000, () => g.remove(alien));\n```\nThis allows the alien to display its `explosion` image state for one\nsecond before it disappears from the game.\n\nThese are the basic techniques involved in making the aliens explode\nand removing the aliens and bullets from the game when they collide.\nBut the actual code used in Alien Armada is a little more complex. That's\nbecause the code uses nested `filter` loops to loop through all the bullets\nand aliens so that they can be checked against each other for\ncollisions. The code also plays an explosion sound when a collision\noccurs, and updates the score by 1. Here's all the code from the\ngame's `play` function that does this. (If you're new to JavaScript's\n`filter` loops, you can [read about how to use them here.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter))\n```js\n//Check for a collision between the aliens and the bullets.\n//Filter through each alien in the `aliens` array.\naliens = aliens.filter(alien => {\n\n  //A variable to help check if the alien is\n  //alive or dead.\n  let alienIsAlive = true;\n\n  //Filter though all the bullets.\n  bullets = bullets.filter(bullet => {\n\n    //Check for a collision between an alien and bullet.\n    if (g.hitTestRectangle(alien, bullet)) {\n\n      //Remove the bullet sprite.\n      g.remove(bullet);\n\n      //Show the alien's `destroyed` state.\n      alien.show(alien.states.destroyed);\n\n      //You could alternatively use the frame number,\n      //like this:\n      //alien.show(1);\n\n      //Play the explosion sound.\n      explosionSound.play();\n\n      //Stop the alien from moving.\n      alien.vy = 0;\n\n      //Set `alienAlive` to false so that it can be\n      //removed from the array.\n      alienIsAlive = false;\n\n      //Wait for 1 second (1000 milliseconds) then \n      //remove the alien sprite.\n      g.wait(1000, () => g.remove(alien));\n\n      //Update the score.\n      score += 1;\n\n      //Remove the bullet from the `bullets array.\n      return false;\n\n    } else {\n\n      //If there's no collision, keep the bullet in the\n      //bullets array.\n      return true;\n    }\n  });\n\n  //Return the value of `alienIsAlive` back to the \n  //filter loop. If it's `true`, the alien will be\n  //kept in the `aliens` array. \n  //If it's `false` it will be removed from the `aliens` array.\n  return alienIsAlive;\n});\n```\nAs long as the filter loops return `true`, the current sprite being\nchecked will remain in the array. If there's a collision, however, the\nloops return `false` and the current alien and bullet will be removed\nfrom their arrays. \n\nAnd that's how the game's collision works!\n\n<a id='displayingscore'></a>\n#### Displaying the score\n\nAnother new feature introduced by Alien Armada is a dynamic score\ndisplay. Each time an alien is hit, the score at the top right corner\nof the game screen increases by one. How does this work?\n\nAlien Armada initializes a `text` sprite called `scoreDisplay` in the\ngame's `setup` function.\n```js\nscoreDisplay = g.text(\"0\", \"20px emulogic\", \"#00FF00\", 400, 10);\n```\nYou saw in the previous section\nthat 1 is added to the game's `score` variable each time an alien is\nhit:\n```js\nscore += 1;\n```\nTo visibly update the score, all you need to do is set the `score`\nvalue as the `scoreDisplay`'s `content`, like this:\n```js\nscoreDisplay.content = score;\n```\nAnd that's all there is to it!\n\n<a id='endinggame2'></a>\n#### Ending and resetting the game\n\nThere are two ways the game can end. Either the player shoots down 60\naliens, in which case the player wins. Or, one of the aliens has to travel\nbeyond the bottom edge of the stage, in which case the aliens win. \n\nA simple if statement in the `play` function checks for this. If\neither condition becomes `true`, the `winner` is set to either\n\"player\" or \"aliens\" and the game's `state` is changed to `end`.\n```js\n//The player wins if the score matches the value\n//of `scoreNeededToWin`, which is 60\nif (score === scoreNeededToWin) {\n\n  //Set the player as the winner.\n  winner = \"player\";\n\n  //Change the game's state to `end`.\n  g.state = end;\n}\n\n//The aliens win if one of them reaches the bottom of\n//the stage.\naliens.forEach(alien => {\n\n  //Check to see if the `alien`'s `y` position is greater\n  //than the `stage`'s `height`\n  if (alien.y > g.stage.height) { \n\n    //Set the aliens as the winner.\n    winner = \"aliens\";\n\n    //Change the game's state to `end`.\n    g.state = end;\n  }\n});\n```\nThe `end` function pauses the game, so that the animation freezes. It\nthen displays the `gameOverMessage`, which will either be \"Earth\nSaved!\" or \"Earth Destroyed!\", depending on the outcome. As an extra\ntouch, the music `volume` is also set to 50%. Then after a\ndelay of 3 seconds, a function named `reset` is called. Here's the\ncomplete `end` function that does all this:\n```js\nfunction end() {\n\n  //Pause the game loop.\n  g.pause();\n  \n  //Create the game over message text.\n  gameOverMessage = g.text(\"\", \"20px emulogic\", \"#00FF00\", 90, 120);\n\n  //Reduce the music volume by half.\n  //1 is full volume, 0 is no volume, and 0.5 is half volume.\n  music.volume = 0.5;\n\n  //Display \"Earth Saved!\" if the player wins.\n  if (winner === \"player\") {\n    gameOverMessage.content = \"Earth Saved!\";\n    gameOverMessage.x = 120;\n  }\n\n  //Display \"Earth Destroyed!\" if the aliens win.\n  if (winner === \"aliens\") {\n    gameOverMessage.content = \"Earth Destroyed!\";  \n  }\n\n  //Wait for 3 seconds then run the `reset` function.\n  g.wait(3000, () => reset());\n}\n```\nThe `reset` function resets all of the game variables back to their\nstarting values. It also turns the music volume back up to 1. It uses\nthe `remove` function to remove any remaining sprites from the\n`aliens` and `bullets` arrays, so that those arrays can be\nre-populated when the game starts again. `remove` is also used to\nremove the `gameOverMessage`, and the `cannon` sprite is re-centered\nat the bottom of the stage. Finally, the game `state` is set back to\n`play`, and the game loop is un-paused by calling Hexi's `resume`\nmethod.\n```js\nfunction reset() {\n\n  //Reset the game variables.\n  score = 0;\n  alienFrequency = 100;\n  alienTimer = 0;\n  winner = \"\";\n\n  //Set the music back to full volume.\n  music.volume = 1;\n\n  //Remove any remaining alien and bullet sprites.\n  //The universal `remove` method will loop through\n  //all the sprites in an array of sprites, removed them\n  //from their parent container, and splice them out of the array.\n  g.remove(aliens);\n  g.remove(bullets);\n\n  //You can also use the universal `remove` function to remove.\n  //a single sprite.\n  g.remove(gameOverMessage);\n\n  //Re-center the cannon.\n  g.stage.putBottom(cannon, 0, -40);\n\n  //Change the game state back to `play`.\n  g.state = play;\n  g.resume();\n}\n```\nAnd this is all the code needed to start the game again. You can play\nAlien Armada as many times as you like and it will reset and restart\nitself like this endlessly.\n\n<a id='flappyfairy'></a>\n### Flappy Fairy!\n\nFlappy Fairy is a homage to one of the most infamous games ever made: [Flappy\nBird](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird). Click the\nimage link below to play the game:\n\n[![FlappyFairy](/tutorials/screenshots/21.png)](https://gitcdn.xyz/repo/kittykatattack/hexi/master/tutorials/04_flappyFairy.html)\n\nClick the \"Go\" button, and game will launch in full screen mode. Tap\nanywhere on the screen to make the fairy fly, and help her navigate\nthrough the gaps in 15 pillars to reach the finish. A trail of multicolored \nfairy dust follows the fairy as she flies through the maze. \nIf she hits one of the green blocks she explodes in a shower of dust. \nBut if she manages to navigate through the increasingly narrowing gaps between \nall 15 pillars, she reaches a big floating \u201cFinish\u201d sign. \n\n![Flappy Fairy gameplay](/tutorials/screenshots/22.png)\n\nIf you can make a game like Flappy Fairy, you can make almost any\nother kind of 2D action game. In addition to using the all techniques you've\nalready learnt, Flappy Fairy introduces some exciting new ones:\n\n- Launching a game in full screen mode.\n- Make a click-able button. \n- Create an animated sprite.\n- Use a `tilingSprite` to make a scrolling background.\n- Use particle effects.\n\nYou'll find the fully commented Flappy Fairy source code in the\n`tutorials` folder. Make sure to take a look at it so that you can see\nall of this code in its proper context. Its general structure is identical\nto the other games in this tutorial, with the addition of these new techniques. Let's\nfind out how they were implemented.\n\n<a id='makeabutton'></a>\n#### Make a button\n\nThe game starts when you press the \"Go\" button. The \"Go\" button is a special sprite\ncalled a `button`. `button` sprites have 3 image frame states: up, over and\ndown. You can create a `button` with three states like this:\n```js\ngoButton = g.button([\n  \"up.png\",\n  \"over.png\",\n  \"down.png\"\n]);\n```\n`up.png` is an image that shows what the button should look like when the it's not\ninteracting with the pointer. `over.png` shows what the button looks\nlike when the pointer is over it, and `down.png` is the image that is\ndisplayed when the pointer presses down on the button.\n\n![Button states](/tutorials/screenshots/23.png)\n\n(The `down.png` image is offset slightly down and to the right, so it\nlooks like its being pressed down.) You can assign any images you like\nto these states, and the `button` will display them automatically based on how the pointer is interacting with it. \n\n(Note: If your game is touch-only, you might have only two button states: up and down. In that case, just assign two image frames, and Hexi will assume they refer to the up and down states.)\n\nButtons have special methods that you can define: `press`,\n`release`,`over`, `out` and `tap`. You can assign any code you like to\nthese methods. For example, here's how you could change the game's\nstate when the user releases the `playButton`:\n```js\ngoButton.release = () => {\n  g.state = setupGame;\n};\n```\nButtons also have a Boolean (true/false) property called `enabled`\nthat you\ncan set to `false` if you want to disable the button. (Set `enabled`\nto `true` to re-enable it.) You can also use the button's `state`\nproperty to find out if the button state is currently `\"up\"`, `\"over\"`\nor `\"down\"`. (These state values are strings.)\n\nImportant! You can give **any** sprite the qualities of a button just by\nsetting its `interact` property to `true`, like this:\n```js\nanySprite.interact = true;\n```\nThis will give the sprite `press`, `release`, `over`, `out` and `tap`\nmethods, and the same `state` property as ordinary buttons. This means\nthat you can make any sprite click-able, which is really useful for a\nwide variety of interactive games.\n\nYou can also make the `stage` object interactive, which turns the whole \ngame screen into an interactive button:\n```js\ng.stage.interact = true;\n```\nFor more detail on how to use buttons, see the `buttons.html` file\nin the `examples` folder.\n\n<a id='animatingsprites'></a>\n#### Animating sprites\n\nA neat feature of Flappy Fairy is that the fairy character flaps her wings\nwhen she's flying up. This animation was created by rapidly displaying 3\nsimple images in a continuous loop. Each image displays a slightly different\nframe of the animation, as shown below:\n\n![Animation frames](/tutorials/screenshots/24.png)\n\nThese three images are just three ordinary frames in the game's texture atlas, called\n`0.png`, `1.png` and `2.png`.  But how can you turn a sequence of frames like this into a sprite animation?\n\nFirst, create an array that defines the frames of the animation, like\nthis:\n```js\nlet fairyFrames = [\n  \"0.png\", \n  \"1.png\", \n  \"2.png\"\n];\n```\nThen create a sprite using those frames, like this:\n```js\nlet fairy = g.sprite(fairyFrames);\n```\nOr, if you prefer, you can combine this into one step:\n```js\nlet fairy = g.sprite([\n  \"0.png\", \n  \"1.png\", \n  \"2.png\"\n]);\n\n```\nAny sprite with more than one image frame automatically becomes an\nanimated sprite. If you want the animation frames to start playing,\njust call the sprite's `playAnimation` method:\n```js\nfairy.playAnimation();\n```\nThe frames will automatically play in a continuous loop. If you don't want them\nto loop, set `loop` to `false`.\n```js\nfairy.loop = false;\n```\nUse the `stopAnimation` method to stop an animation:\n```js\nfairy.stopAnimation();\n```\nIf you want to know whether or not a sprite's animation is currently\nplaying, use the Boolean (true/false) `playing` property to find out.\n\nHow quickly or slowly do you want the animation to play? You can set\nthe animation's frames-per-second (`fps`) like this:\n```js\nfairy.fps = 24;\n```\nA sprite animation's frame rate is independent of the game's frame\nrate. That gives you a lot of flexibility to fine-tune sprite\nanimations.\n\nWhat if you don't want to use all the sprite's image frames in the animation, only some of them? For example, imagine that you have a sprite with 30 frames, but you only want to play frames 10 to 15 as part of the animation. Supply the `playAnimation` method with an array containing two numbers: the first and last frames of the sequence you want to play.\n```js\nanimatedSprite.playAnimation([10, 15]);\n```\nNow only the frames between 10 to 15 will play as part of the animation. To make\nthis more readable, you can define the sequence as an array that\ndescribes what those animated frames actually do. For example, perhaps\nthey define a character's walk cycle. You could create an array called\n`walkCycle` that defines those frames:\n```js\nlet walkCycle = [10, 15];\n```\nThen use that array with `playAnimation`, like this:\n```js\nanimatedSprite.playAnimation(walkCycle);\n```\nThat's a bit more code to write, but much more readable!\n\nFor more details on Hexi's sprite animation system and what you can do\nwith it, see the `keyframeAnimation.html`,\n`textureAtlasAnimation.html` and  `animationStates.html` file in the `examples` folder.\n\n<a id='makingthefairyfly'></a>\n#### Making the fairy fly\n\nNow that you know how to animate a sprite, how is Flappy Fairy's\nflying animation triggered when you tap on the game screen?\n\nA value of `0.05`, which represents gravity, is subtracted from the\nfairy's `y` position each frame in the `play` function. This is the\ngravity effect that pulls the fairy to the bottom of the screen. \n```js\nfairy.vy += -0.05;\nfairy.y -= fairy.vy;\n```\nBut when you tap the screen, the fairy flies up. This is thanks to\nHexi's built-in `pointer` object. It has a `tap` method which you can define to\nperform any action you like. In Flappy Fairy, the `tap` method increases the fairy's vertical velocity, `vy`, by 1.5 pixels each time you tap.\n```js\ng.pointer.tap = () => {\n  fairy.vy += 1.5;\n};  \n```\nHexi's built-in `pointer` object also has `press` and `release` methods\nthat you can define in the same way. It also has Boolean (true/false)\n`isUp`, `isDown` and `tapped` properties that you can use to find the\npointer's state, if you need to.\n\nBut you'll notice that the fairy only flaps her wings when she's\nstarting to fly up, and stops flapping when she looses momentum and\nstarts going down. To make this work, you need to know whether the fairy is\ncurrently on the way up, or on the way down, based on a change in the\nfairy's vertical velocity (vy) value. The game implements a well-worn\nold trick to help figure this out. The `play` function captures the\nfairy's velocity for this current frame in a new value called `oldVy`. But\nit does this *only after the fairy's position has changed*. \n```js\nfunction play(){\n\n  //...\n  //... all of the code that moves the fairy comes first...\n  //...\n\n  //Then, after the fairy's position has been changed, capture\n  //her velocity for this current frame\n  fairy.oldVy = fairy.vy;\n}\n```\nThis means that when the next game frame swings around, `oldVy` will still be storing the fairy's velocity value from the *previous frame*. And that means you\ncan use that value to figure out the change in the fairy's velocity from the\nprevious frame to the current frame. If she's starting to go up (if `vy` is\ngreater than `oldVy`), play the fairy's animation: \n```js\nif (fairy.vy > fairy.oldVy) {\n  if(!fairy.playing) {\n    fairy.playAnimation();\n  }\n}\n```\nIf she's starting to go down, stop the animation and just show the\nfairy's first frame.\n```js\nif (fairy.vy < 0 && fairy.oldVy > 0) {\n  if (fairy.playing) fairy.stopAnimation();\n  fairy.show(0);\n}\n```\nAnd that's how the fairy flies!\n\n<a id='makeascrollingbackground'></a>\n#### Make a scrolling background\n\nA fun new feature of Flappy Fairy is that it has an infinitely scrolling\nbackground of clouds moving from right to left.\n\n![Scrolling background](/tutorials/screenshots/25.png)\n\nThe background moves at a slower rate than the green pillars, and that\ncreates the illusion that the clouds are further away. (This is a\nshallow, pseudo 3D effect called **paralax scrolling**.) \n\nThe background is just a single image.\n\n![Scrolling background](/tutorials/screenshots/26.png)\n\nThe image has been designed so that the clouds **tile seamlessly**:\nthe clouds on the top and left match up with the clouds on the right\nand bottom. That means you can connect multiple instances of the same\nimage and they will appear to create a single, unbroken continuous\nimage. ([Image from OpenGameArt.](opengameart.org/content/cartoony-sky)) \n\nBecause this is really useful for games, Hexi has a sprite type\ncalled a `tilingSprite` that's designed just for such infinite\nscrolling effects. Here's how to create a `tilingSprite`: \n```js\nsky = g.tilingSprite(\n  \"sky.png\"              //The image to use\n  g.canvas.width,        //The width\n  g.canvas.height,       //The height\n);\n```\nThe first argument the image your want to use, and the last two\narguments are the sprite's width and height. \n\nTiling sprites have the same properties as normal sprites, with the addition of two new properties: `tileX` and `tileY`. Those two properties let you set the image offset from the sprite's top left corner. If you want to make a tiling sprite scroll continuously, just increase its `tileX` value by some small amount each frame in the game loop, like this:\n```js\nsky.tileX -= 1;\n```\nAnd that's all you need to do to make an infinitely scrolling\nbackground.\n\n<a id='particleeffects'></a>\n#### Particle effects\n\nHow do you create effects like fire, smoke, magic, and explosions? \nYou make lots of tiny sprites; dozens, hundreds or thousands of them. \nThen apply some physical or gravitational constraints to those sprites \nso that they behave like the element you\u2019re trying to simulate. You \nalso need to give them some rules about how they should appear and \ndisappear, and what kinds of patterns they should form. These tiny \nsprites are called particles. You can use them to make a wide range \nof special effects for games.\n\nHexi has a versatile built-in method called `ceateParticles` that can\ncreate most kinds of particle effects you'll need for games. Here's\nthe format for using it:\n```js\ncreateParticles(\n  pointer.x,                           //The particle\u2019s starting x position\n  pointer.y,                           //The particle\u2019s starting y position\n  () => sprite(\"images/star.png\"),     //Particle function\n  g.stage,                             //The container to add the particles to   \n  20,                                  //Number of particles\n  0.1,                                 //Gravity\n  true,                                //Random spacing\n  0, 6.28,                             //Min/max angle\n  12, 24,                              //Min/max size\n  1, 2,                                //Min/max speed\n  0.005, 0.01,                         //Min/max scale speed\n  0.005, 0.01,                         //Min/max alpha speed\n  0.05, 0.1                            //Min/max rotation speed\n);\n```\nYou can see that most of the arguments describe a range between the \nminimum and maximum values that should be used to change the sprites\u2019 \nspeed, rotation, scale, or alpha. You can also assign the number of \nparticles that should be created, and add optional gravity. \nYou can make particles using any sprites by customizing the third argument.\nJust supply a function that returns the kind of sprite you want to use\nfor each particle:\n```js\n() => (\"images/star.png\"),\n```\nIf you supply a sprite that has multiple frames, the `createParticles` \nmethod will automatically choose a random frame for each particle.\nThe minimum and maximum angle values are important for defining the \ncircular spread of particles as they radiate out from the origin point. \nFor a completely circular explosion effect, use a minimum angle of 0 and \na maximum angle of 6.28.\n```js\n0, 6.28,\n```\n(These values are radians; the equivalent in degrees is 0 and 360.) \n0 starts at the 3 o\u2019clock position, pointing directly to the right. 3.14 \nis the 9 o\u2019clock position, and 6.28 takes you around back to 0 again.\nIf you want to constrain the particle range to a narrower angle, just \nsupply the minimum and maximum values that describe that range. Here are \nvalues you could use to constrain the angle to a pizza-slice with the \ncrust pointing left.\n```js\n2.4, 3.6,\n```\nYou could use a constrained angle range like this to create a particle\nstream, like those used to create a fountain or rocket engine flames. \n(You\u2019ll see exactly how to do this ahead.) The random spacing value \n(the sixth argument) determines whether the particles should be spaced \nevenly (`false`) or randomly (`true`) within this range.\nBy carefully choosing the sprite for the particle and finely adjusting \neach parameter, you can use this all-purpose `createParticles` method \nto simulate everything from liquid to fire. In Flappy Fairy, it's used\nto create fairy dust.\n\n<a id='thefairydustexplosions'></a>\n##### The fairy dust explosions\n\nWhen Flappy Fairy hits a block, she disappears in a puff of dust. \n\n![Fairy dust explosion](/tutorials/screenshots/27.png)\n\nHow does that effect work?\n\nBefore we can create the explosion effect, we have to define an array\nthat lists the images we want to use for each particle.\nAs you learned above, the `createParticles` method will randomly \ndisplay a frame on a sprite, if that sprite contains multiple frames. \nTo make this work, first define an array of texture atlas frames that \nyou want to use for the fairy's dust explosion:\n```js\ndustFrames = [\n  \"pink.png\",\n  \"yellow.png\",\n  \"green.png\",\n  \"violet.png\"\n];\n```\nThe explosion happens when the fairy hits one of the green blocks.\nThe game loop does this with the help of the `hitTestRectangle` \nmethod. The code loops through the `blocks.children` array and tests for \na collision between each green block and the fairy. If `hitTestRectangle` \nreturns `true`, the loop quits and a collision object called\n`fairyVsBlock` becomes `true`.\n```js\nlet fairyVsBlock = blocks.children.some(block => {\n  return g.hitTestRectangle(fairy, block, true);  \n});\n```\n`hitTestRectangle`\u2019s third argument needs to be `true` so that the collision \ndetection is done using the sprite\u2019s global coordinates (`gx` and `gy`). \nThat\u2019s because the fairy is a child of the `stage`, but each block is a child \nof the `blocks` group. That means they don\u2019t share the same local coordinate space. \nUsing the blocks sprites' global coordinates forces `hitTestRectangle`\nto use their positions relative to the canvas. \n\nIf `fairyVsBlock` is `true`, and the fairy is currently visible, the \ncollision code runs. It makes the fairy invisible, creates the particle \nexplosion, and calls the game\u2019s `reset` function after a delay of 3 seconds.\n```js\nif (fairyVsBlock && fairy.visible) {\n\n  //Make the fairy invisible\n  fairy.visible = false;\n\n  //Create a fairy dust explosion\n  g.createParticles(\n    fairy.centerX, fairy.centerY, //x and y position\n    () => g.sprite(dustFrames),   //Particle sprite\n    g.stage,                      //The container to add the particles to  \n    20,                           //Number of particles\n    0,                            //Gravity\n    false,                        //Random spacing\n    0, 6.28,                      //Min/max angle\n    16, 32,                       //Min/max size\n    1, 3                          //Min/max speed\n  );\n  \n  //Stop the dust emitter that's trailing the fairy\n  dust.stop();\n\n  //Wait 3 seconds and then reset the game\n  g.wait(3000, reset);\n}\n```\n\n<a id='useaparticleemitter'></a>\n##### Use a particle emitter\n\nA particle emitter is just a simple timer that creates particles at \nfixed intervals. That means instead of just calling the \n`createParticles` method once, the emitter calls it periodically.\nHexi has a built-in `particleEmitter` method that let's you do this easily.\nHere\u2019s how to use it:\n```js\nlet particleStream = g.particleEmitter(\n  100,                                      //The interval\n  () => g.createParticles(                  //The `particleEffect` function\n    //Assign particle parameters...\n  )\n);\n```\nThe `particleEmitter` method just wraps around the `createParticles` method. \nIts first argument is a number, in milliseconds, that determines how \nfrequently the particles should be created. The second argument is \nthe `createParticles` method, which you can customize however you like. \nThe `particleEmitter` method returns an object with `play` and `stop` methods \nthat you can use to control the particle stream. You can use them \njust like the `play` and `stop` methods you use to control a sprite\u2019s \nanimation.\n```js\nparticleStream.play();\nparticleStream.stop();\n```\nThe emitter object also has a `playing` property that will be either \n`true` or `false` depending on the emitter\u2019s current state. (See the\n`particleEmitter.html` file in the `examples` folder for more details\non how to create and use a particle emitter.)\n\nA particle emitter is used in Flappy Fairy to make the fairy emit a \nstream of multicolored particles while she\u2019s flapping her wings. The \nparticles are constrained to an angle between 2.4 and 3.6 radians, so \nthey\u2019re emitted in a cone-shaped wedge to the left of the fairy. \n\n![Emitting fairy dust](/tutorials/screenshots/28.png)\n\nThe particle stream randomly emits pink, yellow, green, or violet \nparticles, each of which is a separate frame on the texture atlas.\n\nHere's the code that creates this effect: \n```js\ndustFrames = [\n  \"pink.png\",\n  \"yellow.png\",\n  \"green.png\",\n  \"violet.png\"\n];\n\n//Create the emitter\ndust = g.particleEmitter(\n  300,                                   //The interval\n  () => {                         \n      g.createParticles(                 //The function\n      fairy.x + 8,                       //x position\n      fairy.y + fairy.halfHeight + 8,    //y position\n      () => g.sprite(dustFrames),        //Particle sprite\n      g.stage,                           //The container to add the particles to               \n      3,                                 //Number of particles\n      0,                                 //Gravity\n      true,                              //Random spacing\n      2.4, 3.6,                          //Min/max angle\n      12, 18,                            //Min/max size\n      1, 2,                              //Min/max speed\n      0.005, 0.01,                       //Min/max scale speed\n      0.005, 0.01,                       //Min/max alpha speed\n      0.05, 0.1                          //Min/max rotation speed\n    );\n  }\n);\n```\nYou can now control the `dust` emitter with `play` and `stop` methods.\n\n<a id='creatingandmovingthepillars'></a>\n#### Creating and moving the pillars\n\nYou now know how Flappy Fairy implements some of Hexi's special features\nfor some fun and useful effects. But, if you're new to game\nprogramming, you might also be wondering how the world that Flappy Fairy flies\nthrough was created. Let's take a quick look at the code that creates\nand moves the green pillars that the fairy has to navigate to reach\nthe Finish sign.\n\nThere are fifteen green pillars in the game. Every five pillars, the \ngap between the top and bottom sections becomes narrower. The first five \npillars have a gap of four blocks, the next five have a gap of three blocks \nand the last five have a gap of two blocks. This makes the game increasingly \ndifficult as Flappy Fairy flies further. The exact position of the gap is \nrandom for each pillar, and different every time game is played. Each pillar \nis spaced by 384 pixels, and here's how they would look like if \nthey were right next to each other.\n\n![The green pillars](/tutorials/screenshots/29.png)\n\nYou can see how the gap gradually narrows from four spaces on the left \ndown to two on the right. \n\nAll the blocks that make up the pillars are in a `group` called\n`blocks`.\n```js\nblocks = g.group();\n```\nA nested for loop creates each block and adds it to the `blocks` container. \nThe outer loop runs 15 times; once to create each pillar. The inner loop \nruns eight times; once for each block in the pillar. The blocks are only \nadded if they\u2019re not occupying the range that\u2019s been randomly chosen for \nthe gap. Every fifth time the outer loop runs, the size of the gap narrows by one.\n```js\n//What should the initial size of the gap be between the pillars?\nlet gapSize = 4;\n\n//How many pillars?\nlet numberOfPillars = 15;\n\n//Loop 15 times to make 15 pillars\nfor (let i = 0; i < numberOfPillars; i++) {\n\n  //Randomly place the gap somewhere inside the pillar\n  let startGapNumber = g.randomInt(0, 8 - gapSize); \n\n  //Reduce the `gapSize` by one after every fifth pillar. This is\n  //what makes gaps gradually become narrower\n  if (i > 0 && i % 5 === 0) gapSize -= 1; \n\n  //Create a block if it's not within the range of numbers\n  //occupied by the gap\n  for (let j = 0; j < 8; j++) {\n    if (j < startGapNumber || j > startGapNumber + gapSize - 1) {\n      let block = g.sprite(\"greenBlock.png\");\n      blocks.addChild(block);\n\n      //Space each pillar 384 pixels apart. The first pillar will be\n      //placed at an x position of 512\n      block.x = (i * 384) + 512;\n      block.y = j * 64;\n    }\n  }\n\n  //After the pillars have been created, add the finish image\n  //right at the end\n  if (i === numberOfPillars - 1) {\n    finish = g.sprite(\"finish.png\");\n    blocks.addChild(finish);\n    finish.x = (i * 384) + 896;\n    finish.y = 192;\n  }\n}\n```\nThe last part of the code adds the big `finish` sprite to the world, which \nFlappy Fairy will see if she manages to make it through to the end.\n\nThe game loop moves the group of blocks by 2 pixels to the right each \nframe, but only while the finish sprite is off-screen:\n```js\nif (finish.gx > 256) {\n  blocks.x -= 2;\n}\n```\nWhen the `finish` sprite scrolls into the center of the canvas, the \n`blocks` container will stop moving. Notice that the code uses the \n`finish` sprite\u2019s global x position (`gx`) to test whether it\u2019s inside \nthe area of the canvas. Because global coordinates are relative to \nthe canvas, not the parent container, they\u2019re really useful for \njust these kinds of situations where you want to want to find a \nnested sprite\u2019s position on the canvas.\n\nMake sure you check out the complete Flappy Fairy source code in the\n`examples` folder so that you can see all this code in its proper context.\n\n<a id='htmlIntegration'></a>\n#Integration with HTML and CSS\n\nHexi works seamlessly with HTML and CSS. You can freely mix Hexi sprites and\ncode with HTML elements, and use Hexi's architecture to build an HTML\nbased application. And, you can use HTML to build a rich user\ninterface for your Hexi games.\n\nHow does it work? Hexi takes a completely hands-off approach. Just write plain old HTML and CSS, however you like,\nand then reference your HTML in your Hexi code. That's all! Hexi\ndoesn't re-invent the wheel, so you can write as much low level HTML/CSS code you like and blend it \ninto your Hexi application however you choose.\n\nYou can find a working example in the [`html` folder in Hexi's `examples`](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/tree/master/examples/38_html) in this code repository.\nIt's a simple number guessing game:\n\n![Number guessing game](/tutorials/screenshots/32.png)\n\nThe gray box that contains the button and text input field are HTML\nelements. Those HTML elements, including the button, are completely styled\nusing CSS. The dynamic text and images are Hexi sprites. \n\nThere's also\nan invisible `<div>` element that's exactly the same size, and in\nexactly the same position, as Hexi's canvas. The big `<div>` element\nfloats over the canvas and contains the gray box, button and input\nfield. \n\nLet's take a quick look at how this works. The `main.html` file looks like\nthis:\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<title>Html integration</title>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\">\n<body>\n\n<!-- UI -->\n<div id=\"ui\">\n  <div id=\"box\">\n    <button>Guess!</button>\n    <input id=\"input\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"X...\" maxlength=\"10\" autofocus>\n  <div>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Hexi -->\n<script src=\"../../src/modules/pixi.js/bin/pixi.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../../bin/modules.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../../bin/core.js\"></script>\n\n<!-- Main application file -->\n<script src=\"main.js\"></script>\n</body>\n```\nThe important part is the `UI` section, just below the `<body>` tag. A\n`div` with the id `ui` is used to enclose the box, button and input.\n\nThe magic happens in the `style.css` file. Here's the most important\npart:\n```css\ncanvas\n  { position : relative\n  }\n\n#ui\n  { position : absolute\n  ; left : 0\n  ; top : 0\n  ; width : 512px\n  ; height : 512px\n\n  /*Important: set the z-index to 1 so that it appears above Hexi's canvas*/\n  ; z-index: 1\n  }\n```\nHexi's `canvas` is set to `relative` and the `ui` div is set to\n`absolute`. `ui` is also set to **exactly** the same width and height, `512px`,\nas Hexi's canvas. Very importantly, `ui` has a `z-index` of `1`\nto force it to display above the canvas. The other HTML elements (the\nbox, button, and input field) are all positioned absolutely relative\nto the `ui` div - check the full CSS code for details.\n\nTo access the button and input field in your Hexi code, just create\nreferences to them in Hexi's `setup` function:\n```js\nfunction setup() {\n\n  //Html elements\n  var button = document.querySelector(\"button\");\n  button.addEventListener(\"click\", buttonClickHandler, false);\n  var input = document.querySelector(\"#input\");\n\n  //...The rest of the setup code creates Hexi sprites...\n```\nThen just create an ordinary function to handle the button clicks,\nlike this:\n```js\nfunction buttonClickHandler(event) {\n\n  //Capture the player's input from the HTML text input field\n  if (input.value) playersGuess = parseInt(input.value);\n\n  //...the rest of the code...\n}\n```\n`input.value` gives you access to whatever the user entered in the\ninput field. This is just plain old vanilla Web API code - nothing\nspecial!. You can use that value to change any Hexi sprite properties.\nTake a look at the source code for details, but there are no surprises.\n\nBut the example code does have one trick up it's sleeve. The entire Hexi\napplication scales up and aligns itself inside the browser. That means\nboth Hexi's canvas and the UI div scale up **and** stay aligned. They\neven re-scale and re-align if the user changes the size of the browser window. How\ndoes that work? Here's the JavaScript code that does this (in the `main.js`\nfile, just after Hexi's standard initialization code):\n```js\n//Scale Hexi's canvas\ng.scaleToWindow();\n\n//Scale the html UI <div> container\nscaleToWindow(document.querySelector(\"#ui\"));\nwindow.addEventListener(\"resize\", function(event){ \n  scaleToWindow(document.querySelector(\"#ui\"));\n});\n```\nHexi's canvas is scaled internally by the Hexi engine, but the UI layer\nis scaled using the global `scaleToWindow` function. (You can find out\nabout the `scaleToWindow` function [here](https://github.com/kittykatattack/scaleToWindow).)\n\nThis loose integration between HTML and Hexi means you're free to customize this however you\nlike. You can do crazy low-level HTML/CSS programming if you want to, mix the logic in \nwith your Hexi sprites, and design any kind of custom layout that you\nneed. It's just HTML! And, yes, you can write your HTML\nwith Angular, React or [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) (Go Elm!!) if you want to.\n\n<a id='aguidetotheexamples'></a>\n#Coming soon: A guide to the examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

OpenSpiel supports n-player\n(single- and multi- agent) zero-sum, cooperative and general-sum, one-shot and\nsequential, strictly turn-taking and simultaneous-move, perfect and imperfect\ninformation games, as well as traditional multiagent environments such as\n(partially- and fully- observable) grid worlds and social dilemmas. OpenSpiel\nalso includes tools to analyze learning dynamics and other common evaluation\nmetrics. Games are represented as procedural extensive-form games, with some\nnatural extensions. The core API and games are implemented in C++ and exposed to\nPython. Algorithms and tools are written both in C++ and Python.\n\nTo try OpenSpiel in Google Colaboratory, please refer to `open_spiel/colabs` subdirectory or start [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/open_spiel/blob/master/open_spiel/colabs/install_open_spiel.ipynb).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"docs/_static/OpenSpielB.png\" alt=\"OpenSpiel visual asset\">\n</p>\n\n# Index\n\nPlease choose among the following options:\n\n*   [Installing OpenSpiel](docs/install.md)\n*   [Introduction to OpenSpiel](docs/intro.md)\n*   [API Overview and First Example](docs/concepts.md)\n*   [Overview of Implemented Games](docs/games.md)\n*   [Overview of Implemented Algorithms](docs/algorithms.md)\n*   [Developer Guide](docs/developer_guide.md)\n*   [Using OpenSpiel as a C++ Library](docs/library.md)\n*   [Guidelines and Contributing](docs/contributing.md)\n*   [Authors](docs/authors.md)\n\nFor a longer introduction to the core concepts, formalisms, and terminology,\nincluding an overview of the algorithms and some results, please see\n[OpenSpiel: A Framework for Reinforcement Learning in Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09453).\n\nFor an overview of OpenSpiel and example uses of the core API, please check out\nour tutorials:\n\n*   [Motivation, Core API, Brief Intro to Replictor Dynamics and Imperfect\n    Information Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NCPqtPwlFQ) by Marc\n    Lanctot.\n    [(slides)](http://mlanctot.info/files/OpenSpiel_Tutorial_KU_Leuven_2022.pdf)\n    [(colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/open_spiel/blob/master/open_spiel/colabs/OpenSpielTutorial.ipynb)\n*   [Motivation, Core API, Implementing CFR and REINFORCE on Kuhn poker, Leduc\n    poker, and Goofspiel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6JNHoGUXCo) by Edward\n    Lockhart.\n    [(slides)](http://mlanctot.info/files/open_spiel_tutorial-mar2021-comarl.pdf)\n    [(colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/open_spiel/blob/master/open_spiel/colabs/CFR_and_REINFORCE.ipynb)\n\nIf you use OpenSpiel in your research, please cite the paper using the following\nBibTeX:\n\n```bibtex\n@article{LanctotEtAl2019OpenSpiel,\n  title     = {{OpenSpiel}: A Framework for Reinforcement Learning in Games},\n  author    = {Marc Lanctot and Edward Lockhart and Jean-Baptiste Lespiau and\n               Vinicius Zambaldi and Satyaki Upadhyay and Julien P\\'{e}rolat and\n               Sriram Srinivasan and Finbarr Timbers and Karl Tuyls and\n               Shayegan Omidshafiei and Daniel Hennes and Dustin Morrill and\n               Paul Muller and Timo Ewalds and Ryan Faulkner and J\\'{a}nos Kram\\'{a}r\n               and Bart De Vylder and Brennan Saeta and James Bradbury and David Ding\n               and Sebastian Borgeaud and Matthew Lai and Julian Schrittwieser and\n               Thomas Anthony and Edward Hughes and Ivo Danihelka and Jonah Ryan-Davis},\n  year      = {2019},\n  eprint    = {1908.09453},\n  archivePrefix = {arXiv},\n  primaryClass = {cs.LG},\n  journal   = {CoRR},\n  volume    = {abs/1908.09453},\n  url       = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09453},\n}\n```\n\n## Versioning\n\nWe use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).\n\n"

Thanks to @MatsMaker\n\n# Setup\nYou'll need to install a few things before you have a working copy of the project.\n\n## 1. Clone this repo:\n\nNavigate into your workspace directory.\n\nRun:\n\n```git clone https://github.com/lean/phaser-es6-webpack.git```\n\n## 2. Install node.js and npm:\n\nhttps://nodejs.org/en/\n\n\n## 3. Install dependencies (optionally you can install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)):\n\nNavigate to the cloned repo's directory.\n\nRun:\n\n```npm install``` \n\nor if you chose yarn, just run ```yarn```\n\n## 4. Run the development server:\n\nRun:\n\n```npm run dev```\n\nThis will run a server so you can run the game in a browser. It will also start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser automatically.\n\nTo run the game, open your browser and enter http://localhost:3000 into the address bar.\n\n\n## Build for deployment:\n\nRun:\n\n```npm run deploy```\n\nThis will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.\n\n## Deploy for cordova:\nMake sure to uncomment the cordova.js file in the src/index.html and to update config.xml with your informations. (name/description...)\n\nMore informations about the cordova configuration:\nhttps://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/config_ref/\n\nThere is 3 platforms actually tested and supported : \n- browser\n- ios\n- android\n\nFirst run (ios example):\n\n```\nnpm run cordova\ncordova platform add ios\ncordova run ios\n```\n\nUpdate (ios example):\n\n```\nnpm run cordova\ncordova platform update ios\ncordova run ios\n```\n\nThis will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.\n\n## Config:\nbefore you get to work you will surely want to check the config file. You could setup dimensions, webfonts, etc\n\n## Webfonts:\nIn the config file you can specify which webfonts you want to include. In case you do not want to use webfonts simply leave the array empty\n\n## Credits\nBig thanks to these great repos:\n\nhttps://github.com/belohlavek/phaser-es6-boilerplate\n\nhttps://github.com/cstuncsik/phaser-es6-demo\n\n## Contributors\n\nhttps://github.com/RenaudROHLINGER\n"

It supports most modern HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript features while still remaining light in binary size and memory usage.\n\nCurrently available for Windows, macOS, and Linux (64-bit only, ARM64 coming).\n\nOfficial API is available for C and C++, with community bindings for C#, Rust, Java, and Go [available here](https://docs.ultralig.ht/docs/language-bindings).\n\nGet started now by [reading the docs](https://docs.ultralig.ht).\n\n## Next-Generation HTML Renderer\n\nYou can think of Ultralight like a smaller, lighter, cross-platform WebKit that's more customizable and designed to display HTML in an existing app rather than function as a standalone browser.\n\nThe API allows you to integrate your native code deeply with JavaScript (we offer bare-metal access to the JavaScriptCore VM API) and allows you to customize file system loaders, font loading, clipboard integration, and even drawing itself (via GPU display lists or the Surface API).\n\n\n## For Games\n\nRender HTML to an in-game texture using our CPU renderer or take performance to the next level using our GPU renderer.\n\nTake advantage of our low-level platform API\u2014 load HTML assets directly from your game's existing asset pipeline using the FileSystem interface.\n\n__\u2192 Learn more by visiting our [Game Integration Guide](https://docs.ultralig.ht/docs/integrating-with-games).__\n\n## For Desktop Apps\n\nGet the best of both worlds by building your native C/C++ desktop app's front-end with modern HTML/CSS/JS.\n\nTake advantage of our AppCore framework to launch cross-platform windows and render to OS-native GPU surfaces (D3D11, D3D12, Metal, OpenGL, and more).\n\n_AppCore is currently under active development and only supports single-window apps at this writing. A number of planned features (app icons, automatic packager, borderless windows with custom draggable titlebars, etc) are missing but on the way._\n\n__\u2192 Learn more by visiting our [Desktop App Guide](https://docs.ultralig.ht/docs/writing-your-first-app).__\n\n### Base Memory Usage\n\n|             | Ultralight  | Electron  |\n|-------------|-------------|-----------|\n| __Windows__ | 9 MB        | 72 MB     |\n| __macOS__   | 17 MB       | 97 MB     |\n| __Linux__   | 15 MB       | 136 MB    |\n\n### Base Distributable Size\n\n|             | Ultralight  | Electron  |\n|-------------|-------------|-----------|\n| __Windows__ | 40 MB       | 147 MB    |\n| __macOS__   | 55 MB       | 163 MB    |\n| __Linux__   | 55 MB       | 179 MB    |\n\n### Comparison with Chromium\n\n|                       | Ultralight               | Chromium                    |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| __Renderer__          | Proprietary (GPU or CPU) | Skia (CPU) / GPU Compositor |\n| __Layout Engine__     | WebCore (WebKit fork)    | Blink                       |\n| __JavaScript VM__     | JavaScriptCore           | V8                          |\n| __IPC__               | None (Single Process)    | Yes (Multi Process)         |\n\n# Architecture\n\nUltralight is a new port of WebKit combined with a new lightweight renderer intended specifically for embedding in apps and games.\n\nPortions of the library are open-source, here's how the library is laid out:\n\n|                    | Description                       | License     | Source Code              |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|\n| __UltralightCore__ | Low-level graphics renderer       | Proprietary | (Available with license) |\n| __WebCore__        | HTML layout engine (WebKit fork)  | LGPL/BSD    | [ultralight-ux/WebCore](https://github.com/ultralight-ux/WebCore) |\n| __Ultralight__     | View, compositor, and event logic | Proprietary | (Avaiable with license)  |\n| __AppCore__        | Optional, desktop app runtime     | LGPL        | [ultralight-ux/AppCore](https://github.com/ultralight-ux/AppCore) |\n\n## Dual High-Performance Renderers\n\nWe support two different renderers for integration into a variety of target environments.\n\n### GPU Renderer\n\nOur optional, high-performance GPU renderer can render HTML directly on the GPU. All painting is performed via virtual display lists and translated to your target graphics platform at runtime. For more info, see [Using a Custom GPUDriver](https://docs.ultralig.ht/docs/using-a-custom-gpudriver).\n\nThe GPU renderer is enabled by default when using Ultralight via the AppCore runtime.\n\n### CPU Renderer\n\nFor easier integration into games and other complex environments, Ultralight can render to an offscreen pixel buffer using an SIMD-accelerated CPU rendering pipeline. Fore more info, see the [Game Integration Guide](https://docs.ultralig.ht/docs/integrating-with-games).\n\nThe library can also render to a user-supplied pixel buffer via the Surface API (see [Using a Custom Surface](https://docs.ultralig.ht/docs/using-a-custom-surface)).\n\nPaths, gradients, and patterns in this mode are rasterized using [Blend2D's high-performance JIT compiler](https://blend2d.com).\n\n# Licensing\n\n## Free License\n\nUltralight is __free__ for non-commercial use and __free__ for commercial use by companies with less than $100K gross annual revenue.

  "language": "Python",
  "readme_contents": "easyAI\n======\n\nEasyAI (full documentation here_) is a pure-Python artificial intelligence framework for two-players abstract games such as Tic Tac Toe, Connect 4, Reversi, etc.\nIt makes it easy to define the mechanisms of a game, and play against the computer or solve the game.\nUnder the hood, the AI is a Negamax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and transposition tables as described on Wikipedia_.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nIf you have ``pip`` installed, type this in a terminal ::\n    \n    sudo pip install easyAI\n    \nOtherwise, download the source code (for instance on Github_), unzip everything into one folder and in this folder, in a terminal, type ::\n    \n    sudo python setup.py install\n\nAdditionally you will need to install Numpy to be able to run some of the examples.\n\n\nA quick example\n----------------\n\nLet us define the rules of a game and start a match against the AI:\n\n.. code:: python\n    \n    from easyAI import TwoPlayerGame, Human_Player, AI_Player, Negamax\n    \n    class GameOfBones( TwoPlayerGame ):\n        \"\"\" In turn, the players remove one, two or three bones from a\n        pile of bones. The player who removes the last bone loses. \"\"\"\n            \n        def __init__(self, players=None):\n            self.players = players\n            self.pile = 20 # start with 20 bones in the pile\n            self.current_player = 1 # player 1 starts\n\n        def possible_moves(self): return ['1','2','3']\n        def make_move(self,move): self.pile -= int(move) # remove bones.\n        def win(self): return self.pile<=0 # opponent took the last bone ?\n        def is_over(self): return self.win() # Game stops when someone wins.\n        def show(self): print (\"%d bones left in the pile\" % self.pile)\n        def scoring(self): return 100 if game.win() else 0 # For the AI\n    \n    # Start a match (and store the history of moves when it ends)\n    ai = Negamax(13) # The AI will think 13 moves in advance \n    game = GameOfBones( [ Human_Player(), AI_Player(ai) ] )\n    history = game.play()\n    \nResult: ::\n    \n    20 bones left in the pile\n    \n    Player 1 what do you play ? 3\n\n    Move #1: player 1 plays 3 :\n    17 bones left in the pile\n\n    Move #2: player 2 plays 1 :\n    16 bones left in the pile\n    \n    Player 1 what do you play ?\n\nSolving the game\n*****************\n\nLet us now solve the game:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from easyAI import solve_with_iterative_deepening\n    r,d,m = solve_with_iterative_deepening(\n        game=GameOfBones(),\n        ai_depths=range(2,20),\n        win_score=100\n    )\n\nWe obtain ``r=1``, meaning that if both players play perfectly, the first player to play can always win (-1 would have meant always lose), ``d=10``, which means that the wins will be in ten moves (i.e. 5 moves per player) or less, and ``m='3'``, which indicates that the first player's first move should be ``'3'``.\n\nThese computations can be speed up using a transposition table which will store the situations encountered and the best moves for each:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    tt = TranspositionTable()\n    GameOfBones.ttentry = lambda game : game.pile # key for the table\n    r,d,m = solve_with_iterative_deepening(\n        game=GameOfBones(),\n        ai_depths=range(2,20),\n        win_score=100,\n        tt=tt\n    )\n\nAfter these lines are run the variable ``tt`` contains a transposition table storing the possible situations (here, the possible sizes of the pile) and the optimal moves to perform. With ``tt`` you can play perfectly without *thinking*:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    game = GameOfBones( [  AI_Player( tt ), Human_Player() ] )\n    game.play() # you will always lose this game :)\n\n\nContribute !\n------------\n\nEasyAI is an open source software originally written by Zulko_ and released under the MIT licence. Contributions welcome! Some ideas: AI algos for incomplete information games, better game solving strategies, (efficient) use of databases to store moves,  AI algorithms using parallelisation.\n\nFor troubleshooting and bug reports, the best for now is to ask on Github_.\n\nHow releases work\n*****************\n\nEvery time a MR gets merged into master, an automatic release happens:\n\n- If the last commit's message starts with `[FEATURE]`, a feature release happens (`1.3.3 -> 1.4.0`)\n- If the last commit's message starts with `[MAJOR]`, a major release happens (`1.3.3 -> 2.0.0`)\n- If the last commit's message starts with `[SKIP]`, no release happens.\n- Otherwise, a patch release happens (`1.3.3 -> 1.3.4`)\n\n\n\nMaintainers\n-----------\n\n- Zulko_ (owner)\n- JohnAD_\n\n\n.. _here: http://zulko.github.io/easyAI\n.. _Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax\n.. _Zulko : https://github.com/Zulko\n.. _JohnAD : https://github.com/JohnAD\n.. _Github :  https://github.com/Zulko/easyAI\n"

Network Next is a radically new way to link networks together, it's a new internet for games, one where networks compete on performance and price to carry your game's traffic.

  "readme_contents": "easyAI\n======\n\nEasyAI (full documentation here_) is a pure-Python artificial intelligence framework for two-players abstract games such as Tic Tac Toe, Connect 4, Reversi, etc.\nIt makes it easy to define the mechanisms of a game, and play against the computer or solve the game.\nUnder the hood, the AI is a Negamax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and transposition tables as described on Wikipedia_.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nIf you have ``pip`` installed, type this in a terminal ::\n    \n    sudo pip install easyAI\n    \nOtherwise, download the source code (for instance on Github_), unzip everything into one folder and in this folder, in a terminal, type ::\n    \n    sudo python setup.py install\n\nAdditionally you will need to install Numpy to be able to run some of the examples.\n\n\nA quick example\n----------------\n\nLet us define the rules of a game and start a match against the AI:\n\n.. code:: python\n    \n    from easyAI import TwoPlayerGame, Human_Player, AI_Player, Negamax\n    \n    class GameOfBones( TwoPlayerGame ):\n        \"\"\" In turn, the players remove one, two or three bones from a\n        pile of bones. The player who removes the last bone loses. \"\"\"\n            \n        def __init__(self, players=None):\n            self.players = players\n            self.pile = 20 # start with 20 bones in the pile\n            self.current_player = 1 # player 1 starts\n\n        def possible_moves(self): return ['1','2','3']\n        def make_move(self,move): self.pile -= int(move) # remove bones.\n        def win(self): return self.pile<=0 # opponent took the last bone ?\n        def is_over(self): return self.win() # Game stops when someone wins.\n        def show(self): print (\"%d bones left in the pile\" % self.pile)\n        def scoring(self): return 100 if game.win() else 0 # For the AI\n    \n    # Start a match (and store the history of moves when it ends)\n    ai = Negamax(13) # The AI will think 13 moves in advance \n    game = GameOfBones( [ Human_Player(), AI_Player(ai) ] )\n    history = game.play()\n    \nResult: ::\n    \n    20 bones left in the pile\n    \n    Player 1 what do you play ? 3\n\n    Move #1: player 1 plays 3 :\n    17 bones left in the pile\n\n    Move #2: player 2 plays 1 :\n    16 bones left in the pile\n    \n    Player 1 what do you play ?\n\nSolving the game\n*****************\n\nLet us now solve the game:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from easyAI import solve_with_iterative_deepening\n    r,d,m = solve_with_iterative_deepening(\n        game=GameOfBones(),\n        ai_depths=range(2,20),\n        win_score=100\n    )\n\nWe obtain ``r=1``, meaning that if both players play perfectly, the first player to play can always win (-1 would have meant always lose), ``d=10``, which means that the wins will be in ten moves (i.e. 5 moves per player) or less, and ``m='3'``, which indicates that the first player's first move should be ``'3'``.\n\nThese computations can be speed up using a transposition table which will store the situations encountered and the best moves for each:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    tt = TranspositionTable()\n    GameOfBones.ttentry = lambda game : game.pile # key for the table\n    r,d,m = solve_with_iterative_deepening(\n        game=GameOfBones(),\n        ai_depths=range(2,20),\n        win_score=100,\n        tt=tt\n    )\n\nAfter these lines are run the variable ``tt`` contains a transposition table storing the possible situations (here, the possible sizes of the pile) and the optimal moves to perform. With ``tt`` you can play perfectly without *thinking*:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    game = GameOfBones( [  AI_Player( tt ), Human_Player() ] )\n    game.play() # you will always lose this game :)\n\n\nContribute !\n------------\n\nEasyAI is an open source software originally written by Zulko_ and released under the MIT licence. Contributions welcome! Some ideas: AI algos for incomplete information games, better game solving strategies, (efficient) use of databases to store moves,  AI algorithms using parallelisation.\n\nFor troubleshooting and bug reports, the best for now is to ask on Github_.\n\nHow releases work\n*****************\n\nEvery time a MR gets merged into master, an automatic release happens:\n\n- If the last commit's message starts with `[FEATURE]`, a feature release happens (`1.3.3 -> 1.4.0`)\n- If the last commit's message starts with `[MAJOR]`, a major release happens (`1.3.3 -> 2.0.0`)\n- If the last commit's message starts with `[SKIP]`, no release happens.\n- Otherwise, a patch release happens (`1.3.3 -> 1.3.4`)\n\n\n\nMaintainers\n-----------\n\n- Zulko_ (owner)\n- JohnAD_\n\n\n.. _here: http://zulko.github.io/easyAI\n.. _Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax\n.. _Zulko : https://github.com/Zulko\n.. _JohnAD : https://github.com/JohnAD\n.. _Github :  https://github.com/Zulko/easyAI\n"

Once the bot is running, start a game with: `@<your-bot-name>: deal`\n\n#### One-Click Heroku\nClick this button:\n\n[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)\n\n#### Manual Heroku\n1. Install [Heroku toolbelt](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up)\n1. Create a new bot integration (as above)\n1. `heroku create`\n1. `heroku config:set SLACK_POKER_BOT_TOKEN=[Your API token]`\n1. `git push heroku master`\n\n#### To Run Locally\n1. Create a `token.txt` file and paste your API token there\n1. `npm install`\n1. `node src/main.js`\n\n## Directions\n* To start a game, `@<your-bot-name>: deal`.\n* To end a game, `@<your-bot-name>: quit game`. The game will end once the current hand finishes.\nNote that any player can end a game at any time with this command, so Be Honorable\u2122.\n* To configure some bot options, `@<your-bot-name>: config <name-of-option>=<value>`. The supported options are:\n```\ntimeout: Sets the duration (in seconds) before a player times out. \nSet to 0 to specify no timeout.\n```\nSo, to start a game without any player timeout, say:\n```\n@<your-bot-name>: config timeout=0\n@<your-bot-name>: deal\n```\n\nCheck the open issues for some planned enhancements.\n\n### AI Players\nAlthough this client was built for managing human players in a Slack channel, it has some support for AI players. To add a bot player:\n\n1. Add a bot class under the `ai/` folder\n1. Implement `getAction`, which is called whenever it is the bot's turn\n1. Modify the `addBotPlayers` method in `src/bot.js` to add your bot to every game\n\n### Test All The Things\nTo run tests, simply do:\n\n1. `gulp`\n\nThe tests produce legible output that matches what users in Slack would see. This is the same test suite that is run on each pull request. This is very helpful when diagnosing a logic bug:\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/2L0Y2Y3d3g0i1x171n2V/Image%202015-09-08%20at%207.00.40%20PM.png)\n\n### Dependencies\n* [NodeJS Slack Client](https://github.com/slackhq/node-slack-client)\n`node-slack-client` abstracts the basics of a Slack bot, including authentication, getting messages from players, and posting messages or attachments to the channel.\n\n* [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS)\nThe majority of this client is written using `RxJS`. It simplifies many of the complex player polling interactions, that would otherwise be Death By Timers, into very legible code.\n\n* [Imgur](https://github.com/kaimallea/node-imgur) / [Lightweight Image Processor](https://github.com/EyalAr/lwip)\nEach card is a separate image, and board images are created on the fly by pasting several cards onto a single canvas (with the help of  `lwip`). The resulting image is than uploaded to `imgur`, which gives us a single URL that can be passed as an attachment to the Slack API. This route was chosen to avoid uploading 318,505,200 images to the cloud, and allows us to modify the card assets easily.\n\n* [Poker Evaluator](https://github.com/chenosaurus/poker-evaluator)\n`poker-evaluator` is used for evaluating the winning hand when it comes time to show down. Here it has been extended to calculate the best 5-card hand from any 7-card hand.\n\n* [MochaJS](http://mochajs.org/)\nMost of the tricky client logic is backed up by tests, which were written using `MochaJS`.\n\n* [Vector Playing Cards](https://code.google.com/p/vector-playing-cards/)\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Free Game Assets\n\nThis tutorial is written by [Hotpot.ai](https://hotpot.ai?s=game_assets). Hotpot helps you create attractive [game assets](https://hotpot.ai/templates/game_asset?s=github_game_assets), [App Store screenshots](https://hotpot.ai/templates/iphone_xs_max?s=github_game_assets), [Google Play screenshots](https://hotpot.ai/templates/samsung_s9?s=github_game_assets), [app icons](https://hotpot.ai/templates/app_store_icon?s=github_game_assets), [logos](https://hotpot.ai/templates/text_design?s=github_game_assets) and other graphics for games, apps, and extensions.\n\nThis guide was originally posted on [Hotpot.ai](https://hotpot.ai/blog/game_assets), and is cross-referenced here for developer convenience and to simplify community contributions.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis page documents both free and paid assets and resources for making Unity games, iOS games, Android games, 2D games, 3D games, and other games. While most of these game assets and game resources are free, some may also offer paid assets through a freemium model. Where possible, we avoid stricly paid assets and resources unless they are best-in-class.\n\nThere are countless assets and resources online to help developers craft incredible games. We spent hours pruning these options and selecting only the best ones to help accelerate game development. Our research produced more than 150 services and resources that span the spectrum of game development, from general game assets to sprites, sounds, music, tile assets, background patterns, and more.\n\nWe do not summarize assets or highlight free ones because free game assets and resources frequently change their terms or purpose, probably because maintaining free resources is not sustainable for most businesses. Other lists that provide summaries or tag free resources commonly become stale as a result.\n\n## List Suggestions\n\nTo add or remove items from this list, please make a pull request.\n\n## AI

Clone the repo (https://github.com/BenFradet/RiotSharp.git) or [download the zip file](https://github.com/BenFradet/RiotSharp/archive/develop.zip).\n\n2. Build the RiotSharp project and add the library to your own application.\n\n### Build your own latest NuGet package\nYou can build your own NuGet package of the latest version with the following command:\n```\ndotnet pack /p:Configuration=Release\n```\nExecute it from the Visual Studio developer command prompt from inside the RiotSharp project folder. \nThen copy the `RiotSharp.*.nupkg` file from the `bin` folder into your local NuGet feed. [Create local NuGet feed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/tools/package-manager-ui#package-sources)\n\n## Usage\n\n### Main API\nIn order to use the API you need an API key which you can get [here](https://developer.riotgames.com/).\n\nEntry point to the API if you do not own a production API key:\n```c#\nvar api = RiotApi.GetDevelopmentInstance(\"YOUR_API_KEY\");\n```\n\nIf you do own a production API key you can specify your own rate limits:\n```c#\nvar api = RiotApi.GetInstance(\"YOUR_API_KEY\",\n  yourRateLimitPer10s, yourRateLimitPer10m);\n```\n\nTo get basic data of a summoner:\n```c#\ntry\n{\n  var summoner = api.Summoner.GetSummonerByNameAsync(Region.Euw, \"SUMMONER_NAME\").Result;\n  var name = summoner.Name;\n  var level = summoner.Level;\n  var accountId = summoner.AccountId;\n}\ncatch (RiotSharpException ex)\n{\n  // Handle the exception however you want.\n}\n```\nEach class represents an API:\n* Account\n* Champion\n* League  \n* Match  \n* Spectator  \n* Status  \n* Summoner \n* ChampionMastery  \n* StaticData  \n* ThirdParty  \n\n\nYou can find a list of all the available operations in [RiotApi in the documentation](http://benfradet.github.io/RiotSharp/api/RiotSharp.RiotApi.html) \nor test some queries on the [Riot Developer Portal](https://developer.riotgames.com/apis)\n\n### Tournament API\n\nYou first have to apply for a tournament API key [here](https://developer.riotgames.com/).\n\nEntry point for the tournament API:\n```c#\nvar tournamentApi = TournamentRiotApi.GetInstance(\"TOURNAMENT_API_KEY\");\n```\n\nNext up, create a provider.\nThe url will receive callbacks with match results.\n```c#\nvar provider = tournamentApi.CreateProvider(Region.Euw, url);\n```\n\nAnd create a tournament:\n```c#\nvar tournament = tournamentApi.CreateTournament(provider.Id, \"TOURNAMENT_NAME\");\n```\n\nNow you can create tournament codes (which you can use to join games):\n```c#\nvar tournamentCode = tournamentApi.CreateTournamentCode(tournament.Id,\n    teamSize, allowedSummonerIds, TournamentSpectatorType.All,\n    TournamentPickType.TournamentDraft, TournamentMapType.SummonnersRift,\n    string.Empty);\n```\n\nThe tournament code can now be entered in the client to join a game with the specified settings.\nPlease note that you should save the provider and tournament IDs if you wish to create more tournament codes later on. You should not create a separate provider and tournament ID for every tournament code. Make sure to read Riot's [guidelines](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/tournaments-api) on this topic.\n\nTo create a Tournament object for an existing tournament, use the following syntax:\n```c#\nvar tournament = new Tournament { Id = id };\n```\n\nYou can then create codes in two ways:\n```c#\ntournament.CreateTournamentCode(teamSize, allowedSummonerIds,\n    TournamentSpectatorType.All, TournamentPickType.TournamentDraft,\n    TournamentMapType.SummonnersRift, string.Empty);\n```\n\nor, alternatively, if you do not wish to create a separate Tournament object, you can call the `CreateTournamentCode` method directly from the API as shown previously.\n\nYou can find a list of all the available operations in [TournamentRiotApi in the documentation](http://benfradet.github.io/RiotSharp/api/RiotSharp.TournamentRiotApi.html).\n\n### Data Dragon / Static API\n\nYou can retrieve static information about the game thanks to the static API (Data Dragon), there is no rate limiting on this API and RiotSharp\ncaches as much data as possible to make as few calls as possible.\n\nDataDragon API is hidden in Main API.\n```c#\nvar someData = api.DataDragon.SomeEndpoint.SomeMethod();\n```\n\nFor example, you can retrieve data about all champions:\n```c#\nvar allVersion = api.DataDragon.Versions.GetAllAsync().Result;\nvar latestVersion = allVersion[0]; // Example of version: \"10.23.1\"\nvar champions = api.DataDragon.Champions.GetAllAsync(latestVersion).Result.Champions.Values;\nforeach (var champion in champions)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(champion.Name);\n    Console.WriteLine(champion.Lore);\n}\n```\n\nAdditionally, you can use the regular API and static API to, for example, retrieve champion masteries for the summoner:\n```c#\nList<ChampionMastery> championMasteries;\ntry\n{\n    championMasteries =  api.ChampionMastery.GetChampionMasteriesAsync(summoner.Region, summoner.Id).Result;\n}\ncatch (RiotSharpException ex)\n{\n    // Handle the exception however you want.\n    return;\n}\n\nforeach (var championMastery in championMasteries)\n{\n    var id = championMastery.ChampionId;\n    var name = api.DataDragon.Champions.GetAllAsync(latestVersion).Result.Champions.Values.Single(x => x.Id == id).Name; // using System.Linq;\n    var level = championMastery.ChampionLevel;\n    var points = championMastery.ChampionPoints;\n\n    Console.WriteLine($\" \u2022  **Level {level} {name}** {points} Points\");\n}\n```\n\nFor a full description check the [RiotSharpTest](RiotSharpTest) project.\n\n## Contribution\n\nSimply send a pull request! The [up-for-grabs](https://github.com/BenFradet/RiotSharp/labels/up-for-grabs) label is a great place to start.\n\nWhen adding new features, please provide the related unit tests within the pull request.\nTo run the unit tests you need to modify the [App.config](RiotSharpTest/App.config) file and fill out the appropriate values so the tests can run.\n\nMoreover, the documentation is far from perfect so every bit of help is more than welcome.\n\n## Libraries used\n\nThis wrapper uses [Json.NET](http://james.newtonking.com/json).\n\n## License\n\nThis wrapper is under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nRiotSharp isn't endorsed by Riot Games and doesn't reflect the views or opinions of Riot Games or anyone officially involved in producing or managing League of Legends.

I've tested it on Windows, but there isn't any reason it wouldn't work on Linux as well. Just change the top line from `#! python3` to `#!/usr/bin/python3` and it should be fine. \n\nBig shout-out to [@ergoithz](https://github.com/ergoithz) and their amazing function that finds the xpath for a given BeautifulSoup object. These updates wouldn't be possible without it! Check out their super-helpful function here: https://gist.github.com/ergoithz/6cf043e3fdedd1b94fcf\n\nAnother *huge* shout-out to [@SonOfDiablo](https://github.com/SonOfDiablo) for creating and providing their awesome PowerShell script for installing geckodriver on Windows! Now you don't have to follow all the steps mentioned before. Just install the PowerShell script, and run it. This will: download and install the latest geckodriver for the correct architecture, install it, and add it to your path if it isn't already there: automagically! Find the script here: https://gist.github.com/SonOfDiablo/81f3d610295c69c777b512e4da90393d\n\nFinally, a warm thank you to:\n  - [@Andriesmenze](https://github.com/Andriesmenze) for fixing the script to work in the EU due to certain pop-ups that I wasn't seeing. Their work is very appreciated!\n  - [@Steve-Tech](https://github.com/Steve-Tech) for adding some code to click the \"Sign in with Epic Games\" that apparently shows up now.\n  - [@Spifffff](https://github.com/Spifffff) for modifying the Xpath for the cookies banner, for noticing that EGS requires email-only for logging in now, and for modifying the script to work with the games carousel that shows up sometimes\n  - [@lemasato](https://github.com/lemasato) for adding 2FA support, adding some more reliability and readability changes as well as adding functionality for multiple accounts to be used and staying on top of changes they do to the site like text on buttons and what not.\n  - [@Medallyon](https://github.com/Medallyon) for cleaning up my README file, adding \"requirements.txt\" functionality, and making some important syntax changes as well as some credential detection stuff. This will help cut down on install time/complexity significantly.\n  - [@astranberg](https://github.com/astranberg) for expanding on multi-user support so you can now collect all the free games for multiple accounts.\n\nHope you enjoy!\n  #! Mason Stooksbury\n\n### Updates! (12/21/2020)\n  - Multi-user support so that free games can be claimed for as many accounts as you have.\n  - Thank you again! In just a month we've gained like 20 more stars for a total of 80! And almost 10 more forks! You all continue to humble me with the amount of support this thing has gotten. Thank you again, and may your 2021 be so much better than this year.\n\n# Setup\n\n## Requirements\n\nFirst, clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/MasonStooksbury/Free-Games.git`. Then,\n\n1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to automatically install dependencies\n\n***OR***\n\nInstall them manually:\n  + `pip install lxml` (for parsing the HTML from the webpage)\n  + `pip install selenium` (for \"roboting\" the website)\n  + `pip install beautifulsoup4` (for better/more robust finding of objects and things)\n  + `pip install pyotp` (for two-factor authentication)\n\n### Additionally\n\n+ `GeckoDriver` (selenium needs this) Linux users can use this script to do everything for you after installing \"jq\" which is a JSON processor: https://gist.github.com/cgoldberg/4097efbfeb40adf698a7d05e75e0ff51. Windows users can use this script provided by [@SonOfDiablo:](https://github.com/SonOfDiablo:) https://gist.github.com/SonOfDiablo/81f3d610295c69c777b512e4da90393d.\n+ [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/) - You can technically do all of this with Chrome, but it involves some more setup with selenium and particular drivers and I'm just too lazy. This works perfectly fine.\n+ Enter the `EPIC_EMAIL` and `EPIC_PASSWORD` variables in the `.env` file to match your Epic Games Store account. Don't include any quotes here.\n+ You may add multiple user accounts using comma separated values, e.g. `EPIC_EMAIL=a@a.com,b@b.com` `EPIC_PASSWORD=pass1,pass2`\n+ While the scipt will technically work without 2FA enabled on your epic account, you will likely see many more captchas. In order to avoid this, follow the steps [here](###Two-factor-authentication) to enable 2FA on your account and configure the script to work with your 2FA secret. \n+ Finally, you may also want to jump into `Free_Games.py` and replace the `user_agent` variable (but you don't have to). There are instructions inside the script on how to do this. \n\n### Two-factor authentication\n\nIf you already have 2FA enabled on your account, you will be required to disable it temporarily. This is required to retrieve the key we need.\n\n1. Go to [your Epic account settings](https://www.epicgames.com/account/password) and enable \"**Authenticator App**\".\n1. Keep a copy of the \"**Manual Entry Key**\". This will be used later in the python script. Do not close the page yet.\n1. On your phone, download [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en) or another similar application.\n1. Using the application, scan the QR code visible on browser. Enter the code obtained from the application on the browser and click \"**Activate**\".\n1. Keep a copy of the \"**Rescue Codes**\". This will come in handy to retrieve your account if you ever lose access to your Authentificator application (losing phone, etc.)\n1. In the python script, input the \"**Manual Entry Key**\" retrieved earlier in the corresponding field, again leaving the single quotes as is.\n1. Done!\n\n### Finally\n\nNow all you have to do is run `python Free_Games.py`, sit back & relax while your free games are being claimed (actually, you may have to complete a captcha upon signing in , but that's it).\n\n# Setting up Windows Task Scheduler\n\nThese steps should help you get Windows Task Scheduler setup in such a way that it will wake your computer from sleep and grab your free games then go back to sleep. It will also be setup to run again if something goes wrong as well as kill itself if it goes haywire. I realize the first picture shows it being setup for Vista and Windows Server 2008, but this was the only way it would work on Windows 10 without doing some wonky BIOS setup that only worked for some people.\n\n1.

Any method call from the Riot API is a request that counts towards your rate limit, except requests regarding static data which count toward a method rate limit but not toward your app rate limit. The below code makes 2 requests; one request for a summoner, and another for the match list of a summoner.\n\n```java\nimport net.rithms.riot.api.ApiConfig;\nimport net.rithms.riot.api.RiotApi;\nimport net.rithms.riot.api.RiotApiException;\nimport net.rithms.riot.api.endpoints.match.dto.MatchList;\nimport net.rithms.riot.api.endpoints.match.dto.MatchReference;\nimport net.rithms.riot.api.endpoints.summoner.dto.Summoner;\nimport net.rithms.riot.constant.Platform;\n\n/**\n * This example demonstrates using the RiotApi to request the match list for a given summoner name and iterating over the match list\n */\npublic class MatchListExample {\n\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) throws RiotApiException {\n\t\tApiConfig config = new ApiConfig().setKey(\"YOUR-API-KEY-HERE\");\n\t\tRiotApi api = new RiotApi(config);\n\n\t\t// First we need to request the summoner because we will need it's account ID\n\t\tSummoner summoner = api.getSummonerByName(Platform.NA, \"tryndamere\");\n\n\t\t// Then we can use the account ID to request the summoner's match list\n\t\tMatchList matchList = api.getMatchListByAccountId(Platform.NA, summoner.getAccountId());\n\n\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Total Games in requested match list: \" + matchList.getTotalGames());\n\n\t\t// We can now iterate over the match list to access the data\n\t\tif (matchList.getMatches() != null) {\n\t\t\tfor (MatchReference match : matchList.getMatches()) {\n\t\t\t\tSystem.out.println(\"GameID: \" + match.getGameId());\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nYou can find these and more examples in the repository's directory \"examples\".\n\n## Documentation\nThe documentation for this library can be found [here.](http://taycaldwell.com/riot-api-java/doc/)\n\n## API Versions\nThe current version of this library supports the following Riot Games API versions:\n- **CHAMPION-MASTERY-V4**\n- **CHAMPION-V3**\n- **LEAGUE-V4**\n- **LOL-STATUS-V3**\n- **MATCH-V4**\n- **SPECTATOR-V4**\n- **STATIC-DATA-V3** (deprecated)\n- **SUMMONER-V4**\n- **THIRD-PARTY-CODE-V4**\n- **TOURNAMENT-V3**\n- **TOURNAMENT-STUB-V4**\n\n## Contributing\nAll contributions are appreciated.\nIf you would like to contribute to this project, please send a pull request.\n\n## Contact\nHave a suggestion, complaint, or question?

This is still very experimental in both MO2 and Wabbajack.\n\nSome like Mechwarrior 5 use a complete new method of creating a list found [here](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/wiki/Native-Game-Installer---(Installers-not-using-MO2)), for more info on that best join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack) for guidance.\n\n## Installing a Modlist\n\nEvery Modlist comes with its own README containing information and instructions on how to install it correctly. You should definitely read the Modlist specific README if you want a successful installation.\n\nThe general procedure is download the Modlist which comes as a `.wabbajack` file, opening Wabbajack, clicking on the _Install From Disk_ button, configuring Install and Download Location and hitting start.\n\nDo note that installation can take anything from a few minutes to hours depending on the size of the Modlist, your Internet connection as well as your hardware. In the meantime you can take a look at some of the included mods of the Modlist in the Slideshow that is playing during installation.\n\n## Creating your own Modlist\n\nModlist Creation or Compilation as we call it, is a trial and error process. You will likely get a decent amount of compilation errors in the beginning and have to spent some time fixing them before your first compilation succeeds. After that you can do incremental builds which take significantly less time and have close to zero errors compared to your first build.\n\n### Requirements\n\nWabbajack requires that you created your Modlist using a **portable** version of Mod Organizer 2. This is a **hard requirement** and Wabbajack won't work with Vortex, Kortex, Wyre Bash, Nexus Mod Manager, Oblivion Mod Manager or any other Mod Manager, not even Mod Organizer 1.\n\nAside from needed a portable MO2 installation you need to have a specific setup and workflow when modding, see [Pre-Compilation](#pre-compilation) for more information about that.\n\n### Pre-Compilation\n\nCompilation itself is similar to Installation as you just configure some paths and start the process, sit back and wait for Wabbajack to finish. Wabbajack requires a rather specific MO2 setup and you might have to change your workflow when modding for a WJ Modlist.\n\n#### Everything comes from somewhere\n\n> Wabbajack is an automated Modlist Installer that can reproduce an entire modding setup on another machine without bundling any assets or re-distributing any mods.\n\nThe focus is on _without bundling any assets or re-distributing any mods_. This means that Wabbajack needs to know where **every single file** came from. The most common origin is your downloads folder.\n\nIf you take a quick look inside your MO2 downloads folder you will find 2 types of files:\n\n1) The actual download (some archive)\n2) A `.meta` file that has the same name the archive its for\n\nYou might have `SkyUI_5_1-3863-5-1.7z` and `SkyUI_5_1-3863-5-1.7z.meta`.\n\nThese `.meta` files are created by MO2 and typically get created when you click the _MOD MANAGER DOWNLOAD_ button on Nexus Mods. If you open the `.meta` file you will find some metadata for the accompanied archive, the most important entries being `fileID`, `modID` and `gameName`.\n\nWabbajack will use the MO2 `.meta` files to find out where the archive came from using the [Nexus Mods API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/NexusMods/nexus-mods_public_api_params_in_form_data/1.0#/). This means that you **should** use the _MOD MANAGER DOWNLOAD_ button on Nexus Mods or you have to create those `.meta` files yourself (you can also use the _Query Info_ context menu option in the MO2 Downloads tab. This will populate the metadata of the selected archive).\n\nFor more information about `.meta` files, support sites and how to actually create them, see the [Meta File](#meta-files) section.\n\n#### Script Extender and Cleaned Masters\n\nThe first step for modding a Bethesda game: Download the game, install the Script Extender and clean base game master files (`.esms`). Wabbajack can, of course, automate these steps.\n\n_(You should use MO2s virtual file system for SKSE Scripts, it is not recommended to install the SKSE Scripts into the game folder directly)_.\n\nWabbajack can match files from your game folder with your downloads folder (more in-depth info on that topic: [Game Folder Files and MO2](#game-folder-files-and-mo2)), this means you download the Script Extender to your MO2 downloads folder and create a `.meta` file for it. The meta file should look something like this:\n\n```ini\n[General]\ndirectURL=http://skse.silverlock.org/beta/skse64_2_00_18.7z\n```\n\nIn the example above we used [SKSE SE 2.0.18](http://skse.silverlock.org/) and you'd have to replace the URL with the direct download link of the Script Extender you are using.\n\nNext up are Cleaned Master Files. Use xEdit through MO2 and clean the base game master files normally, copy the cleaned master files to a new mod in MO2 (called `Cleaned Master Files` or something) and replace the cleaned master files in your game folder with the backup created by xEdit to revert them to their default unmodified state.\n\n#### Game Folder Files and MO2\n\nYou now know about `.meta` files and understand that every file has to come from somewhere, this also means that you also need to create `.meta` files for MO2 and files in your game folder. We recommend using the [MO2 GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer/releases/) instead of the ones you find on the Nexus.\n\nMods that need to be installed to the game folder by the user are required to be installed to a `Game Folder Files` folder in your MO2 directory. Let's look at an example for better understanding:\n\nYou will likely make use of SKSE/F4SE/OBSE or other Script Extender if you are modding Bethesda titles. Eg for SKSE you'd need to install `skse64_1_5_97.dll`, `skse64_loader.exe` and `skse64_steam_loader.dll` to your game folder. To make things easier for the end user, you can should put those files inside the `Game Folder Files` folder at `MO2\\Game Folder Files`. You also need the archive and it's `.meta` file (see [Script Extender and Cleaned ESMs](#script-extender-and-cleaned-masters) section if you haven't) in your downloads folder so Wabbajack can match those files.\n\nThe user then only has to copy the files from the `Game Folder Files` directory to their game folder after installation. This also works for other files that need to be installed directly to the game folder like ENB or ReShade.\n\n#### Stock Game\n\nAs an alternative to Game Folder Files, you may instead utilize the [Stock Game](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/wiki/Keeping-The-Game-Folder-Clean-(via-local-game-installs)) feature. Stock Game is a folder within the MO2 instance folder that contains the base game files necessary to run a list, including any files you need to add to it such as `skse64_loader.exe`. Stock Game eliminates the need for the user to copy `Game Folder Files` into their game's installation directory and keeps the final installed list separate from the game's installation directory. Additionally, this allows a list author fine control over what files are included by default in the game's installation, such as SKSE, ENB, and so on. \n\nNote that Stock Game has one downside: When using Stock Game, Wabbajack will expect the game to come from a single source and *only* a single source (Steam, GOG, etc.). As an example: Morrowind is available on GOG, Steam, and Beth.net. When utilizing Stock Game with a copy of Morrowind from Steam, Wabbajack will expect all users who install the list to have the game through Steam, effectively excluding users who have purchased the game from GOG or Beth.net. Because of this, it is recommended that Stock Game only be utilized with games that have a single source, such as Skyrim SE which is only available through Steam.\n\nDetailed setup information for Stock Game on Skyrim SE can be found [here.](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/main/lessons/Setting%20up%20Stock%20Game%20for%20Skyrim%20SE.md)\n\n#### Special Flags\n\nThere are some special cases where you want to change the default Wabbajack behavior for a specific mod. You can place the following flags in the notes or comments section of a mod to change how Wabbajack handles that mod.\n\n| Flag | Description | Notes |\n|------|-------------|-------|\n| `WABBAJACK_INCLUDE` | All mod files will be inlined into the `.wabbajack` file | **DO NOT USE ON DOWNLOADED MODS** As it would result in you distributing that mod. Can lead to large `.wabbajack` files if used unsparingly |\n| `WABBAJACK_NOMATCH_INCLUDE` | Any unmatched files will be inlined into the `.wabbajack` file | Useful for custom patches or generated files |\n| `WABBAJACK_ALWAYS_ENABLE` | The mod will not be ignored by Wabbajack even if it's disabled | Wabbajack will normally ignore all mods you disabled in MO2 but there are some cases where you might want to give some choice to the end user and want to have the mod included |\n| `WABBAJACK_ALWAYS_DISABLE` | The mod will always be ignored by Wabbajack | Useful if you don't want some mods included in the Modlist but still want to keep it active in your own setup |\n\n#### Tagfile Tags\n\nYou can create an empty `tagfile` with no extention in any folder you want to apply this tags to. This is meant to be used with folders that aren't mods.\n\n| Flag/File | Description | Notes |\n|------|-------------|-------|\n| `WABBAJACK_INCLUDE` | All files in this folder will be inlined into the `.wabbajack` file | **DO NOT USE ON DOWNLOADED MODS** As it would result in you distributing that mod. Can lead to large `.wabbajack` files if used unsparingly |\n| `WABBAJACK_NOMATCH_INCLUDE` | Any unmatched files will be inlined into the `.wabbajack` file | Useful for custom patches or generated files |\n| `WABBAJACK_IGNORE` | All files in this folder will be ignored by Wabbajack and therefore not be put into into the `.wabbajack` file. | Useful for tools or other things outside a mod you don't want/need reproduced on a users machine. Handle with care since excluded stuff can potentially break a setup.\\* |\n| `WABBAJACK_INCLUDE_SAVES` | When this file exists Wabbajack will include your save files in the `.wabbajack` file.| This will remove previous savefiles when the list gets installed as an update. |\n| `WABBAJACK_NOMATCH_INCLUDE_FILES.txt` | All files listed in this file will be included in the `.wabbajack` file. | Every file needs to be in the same folder as the tag file. Every file need to be written into a new line. Every file needs to be added with its file extension.|\n| `WABBAJACK_IGNORE_FILES.txt` | All files listed in this file will be ignored by Wabbajack and not included in the `.wabbajack` file. | Every file needs to be in the same folder as the tag file. Every file need to be written into a new line. Every file needs to be added with its file extension.|\n\n\\*It will finish the installation of a modlist, but the installed list might not run if you excluded a crutial part of it.\n\n#### Patches\n\nReading all the previous section you might wonder if Wabbajack is able to detect modified files and how it deals with them. Wabbajack can't include the modified file so instead we just include the difference between the original and modified version.\n\nThis basically means `original + patch = final` and we only include `patch` in the `.wabbajack` file which, by itself, is just gibberish and completely useless without the original file. This allows us to distribute arbitrary changes without violating copyrights as we do not copy copyrighted material. Instead, we copy instructions on how to modify the copyrighted material.\n\nYou don't even have to tell Wabbajack that a specific file was modified, that would be way too much work. Instead Wabbajack will figure out which file got modified and create a binary patch. The modified file can be anything from some modified settings file to a patched plugin or optimized mesh/texture.\n\n#### BSA Decomposition\n\nWabbajack is able to analyse `.bsa` and `.ba2` files and can also create those. This means that any changes made to a BSA/BA2 are copied on the end-user's installation, including the creation of new BSAs or the modification of existing ones. Unpacking, modifying, and then repacking a BSA is possible and those modifications will carry over to the final install. Similarly, creation of new BSAs will be replicated. Wabbajack does not analyze the BSA as a whole - instead it will look inside the BSA, hash the files within, and compare those to their original sources. It will then construct the BSA if new or reconstruct it if modified as necessary. Note that with particularly large BSAs this building and rebuilding process can take a significant amount of time on the user's machine depending on the user's hardware specifications.\n\n#### Merges\n\nSimilar to BSAs, Wabbajack is able to analyze and create merged mods. Wabbajack will source the necessary files to create the merge from aforementioned sources of mods and then rebuild the merge on the user's end. Generally it is recommended to tag merges with the `WABBAJACK_NOMATCH_INCLUDE` flag to ensure that any files generated by the merging process are also carried over to the user. Wabbajack does not by default include the files and information necessary to build or rebuild the merge in the program used to build the merge originally, only the merge itself will be installed. \n\n#### Multiple MO2 Profiles\n\nWabbajack will normally ignore every other profile but you might have more than one profile that should be included. In this case you can create a `otherprofiles.txt` file in your main profile folder and write the names of the other profiles (1 per line) in it.\n\n**Example**:\n\nProfiles: `SFW`, `NSFW` (`SFW` is the main profile)\n\ncontents of `MO2\\profiles\\SFW\\otherprofiles.txt`:\n\n```txt\nNSFW\n```\n\n#### Minimal Downloads Folder\n\nWe already talked about how Wabbajack will _match_ files to determine where they came from. This can sometimes not work as intended and Wabbajack might end up matching files against the wrong archive. This can happen when you have multiple versions of the same mod in your downloads folder. It is highly recommended that you **delete unused downloads and previous versions of mods** so that Wabbajack doesn't end up mis-matching files and the end user ends up downloading more than they need.\n\n### Compilation\n\nCompilation itself is very straight forward and similar to Installation: you let Wabbajack run and hope it finishes successfully. The key for making it run successfully is having a \"Wabbajack-compliant\" MO2 setup which you can get by following the advice from the previous sections.\n\nFor a more detailed guide on executing the compilation process, refer to [this document.](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/main/lessons/Compiling%20a%20Modlist%20for%20Wabbajack.md)\n\n#### Wabbajack Compilation Configuration\n\nIn Wabbajack select _Create a Modlist_ to navigate to the configuration screen. Here you can configure some metadata for your Modlist which will later be viewable by the user.\n\n| Field | Description | Notes |\n|-------|-------------|-------|\n| Modlist Name | **REQUIRED:** Name of your Modlist | |\n| Version | **REQUIRED:** Current Version | Do note that this has to be a semantic version (1.0 or 0.1 (it can have multiple `.` separators)) and not some random text like \"The best version on Earth\" (this is not the Nexus)! |\n| Author | Modlist Author | Should be your name in original Modlists and/or the name of the original Modlist author if you adapted a normal Modlist to a Wabbajack Modlist |\n| Description | 700 characters Descriptions | |\n| Image | Modlist Image | Aspect ratio should be 16:9 for the best result |\n| Website | Website URL | |\n| Readme | Readme URL | |\n| NSFW | NSFW Checkbox | Only really needed for official Modlists as our Galleries have the option to hide NSFW Modlists |\n\n#### Compilation Errors\n\nYou will likely get a ton of errors during your first compilation which is to be expected. We highly recommend you join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack) and check the `modlist-development-help` channel for help.\n\n### Post-Compilation\n\nAfter you have finished the Compilation you are basically done with Wabbajack and can upload the resulting `.wabbajack` file to somewhere, share it with people or just keep it for yourself as a Modlist backup. This section is for people who want to share their Modlist with the community.\n\nIn the Wabbajack community we differentiate between _official_ and _unofficial_ Modlists. The former being curated Modlists which have been tested and are available in the Wabbajack Gallery while the latter are Modlists submitted on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack) in the `unofficial-modlist-submissions` channel and are not tested.\n\nOfficial Modlists also get their own support channel on our Discord and often have 500-2500 users depending on the game. Do note that these Modlists receive regular updates and the authors are putting in a lot of hours to deliver the best possible version. If you think your Modlist and more importantly: yourself are up for the task you can submit your Modlist for official status on the Discord in the `modlist-development-info` channel.\n\nManaging a Modlist can be tricky if you have never done something like this. In the early days of Wabbajack we mostly relied on GDocs READMEs and hosted all accompanying files on GDrive while managing issues through the support channel on Discord. This system was later almost completely replaced through valiant effort by one of our developers: almost all new Modlists use GitHub for managing their Modlist.\n\nGitHub was made for developers and is the site you are currently on. It mostly hosts source code for open source projects, such as Wabbajack, but can also be used for project management. Another strong point is Markdown support. This README you are currently reading is, like every other GitHub README, written in Markdown and rendered on GitHub.\n\nOn the topic of READMEs: you should create a good one.\n\nIt is not sufficient to just slap some install and MCM instructions in there. Your Modlist might contain a thousand mods and offer hundreds of playtime but the user might not know what in oblivion is even going on and what's included.\n\nExample structure for a good README:\n\n- **Preamble**: Give a quick overview about what your Modlist is about, the core idea and also mention that it's a Wabbajack Modlist (some might not know what Wabbajack is so link to this README)\n- **Requirements**: Simple list of requirements such as min CPU, GPU, RAM and most importantly: Drive Space. Also include a list of accounts the user needs such as a Nexus Mods, LoversLab, VectorPlexus Account or any other sites your are downloading from\n- **Installation**: Installation instructions specific to your Modlist. You can take a look at some of the Modlists linked below as almost all of them use the same instructions with minor changes\n- **Important Mods you should know about**: This is an important section you should not forget. Go in-depth on core mods and talk about _important mods the user should know about_. It can be overwhelming for the user to just be thrusted into a completely modded world without knowing what's even included and possible.\n- **MCM**: If your Modlist has some sort of MCM like for Skyrim or Fallout 4 then you should give instructions on what settings to use\n- **Changelog**: Should not be in the README and can be in a separate file called `CHANGELOG.md` but make sure to create one\n\nSome Modlists that host all their stuff on GitHub:\n\n- the OG GitHub Modlist: [Lotus](https://github.com/erri120/lotus)\n- [Keizaal](https://github.com/PierreDespereaux/Keizaal)\n- [Elder Souls](https://github.com/jdsmith2816/eldersouls)\n- [Total Visual Overhaul](https://github.com/NotTotal/Total-Visual-Overhaul)\n- [Serenity](https://github.com/ixanza/serenity)\n- [RGE](https://github.com/jdsmith2816/rge)\n- [Elysium](https://github.com/TitansBane/Elysium)\n\nOther modlists opt to host all of their information on a dedicated website:\n- [The Phoenix Flavour](https://thephoenixflavour.com)\n- [Living Skyrim](https://www.fgsmodlists.com/living-skyrim)\n- [MOISE](https://www.fgsmodlists.com/moise)\n- [Dungeons & Deviousness](https://www.fgsmodlists.com/dd)\n- [Tales From the Northern Lands](https://eziothedeadpoet.github.io/Tales-from-the-Northern-Lands/)\n\n### Meta Files\n\n_Read [Everything comes from somewhere](#everything-comes-from-somewhere) first, as that section explains the basic concept of meta files. This section focuses more on advanced uses._\n\nYou already know how `.meta` files should look for mods that come from Nexus Mods:\n\n```ini\n[General]\ngameName=Skyrim\nmodID=3863\nfileID=1000172397\n```\n\nThis is the basic configuration for an archive that came from Nexus Mods. You can get these types of `.meta` files through MO2 by using the _Query Info_ option in the Downloads tab.\n\nMods can also be hosted somewhere else, eg on other modding sites like LoversLab, ModDB or normal file hosting services like GDrive and MEGA. Below is a table for all supported sites that Wabbajack can download from.\n\n**Additional notes**:\n\n- Every `.meta` file, no matter the site, has to start with `[General]`\n- `.meta` files are **case sensitive** (see [Issue `#480`](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/issues/480) for more info, this will be fixed somewhere in the future)\n- The \"Whitelist\" Wabbajack uses is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/opt-out-lists/blob/master/ServerWhitelist.yml) and you might have to create a Pull Request if you want to add a link\n- For IPS4 Sites: IPS4 sites have a common layout and all behave very similar. There are some minor differences because they use different template versions but in general the same layout applies to all of them. Here are the different download links you can have for IPS4 sites:\n  - Multi-file download: `{SITE-PREFIX}/files/file/{FILE}/?do=download&r={ID}&confirm=1&t=1`\n  - Single-file download: `{SITE-PREFIX}/files/file/{FILE}/`\n  - Attachments: `{SITE-PREFIX}/applications/core/interface/file/attachment.php?id={ID}`\n\n| Site | Requires Login | Requires Whitelist Entry | Meta File Layout | Example | Notes |\n|------|----------------|--------------------------|------------------|---------|-------|\n| [LoversLab](https://www.loverslab.com/) | Yes | No | IPS4 Site Prefix: `https://www.loverslab.com` | `directURL=https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/11116-test-file-for-wabbajack-integration/?do=download&r=737123&confirm=1&t=1` | IPS4 Site, mostly multi-file downloads |\n| [VectorPlexus](https://vectorplexus.com/) | Yes | No | IPS4 Site Prefix: `https://vectorplexus.com` | `directURL=https://vectorplexus.com/files/file/290-wabbajack-test-file` | IPS4 Site, mostly multi-file downloads |\n| [TES Alliance](http://tesalliance.org/) | Yes | No | IPS4 Site Prefix: `http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?` | `directURL=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/2035-wabbajack-test-file/` | IPS4 Site, mostly single-file downloads |\n| [TESAll](https://tesall.ru) | Yes | No | IPS4 Site Prefix: `https://tesall.ru` | `directURL=https://tesall.ru/files/getdownload/594545-wabbajack-test-file/` | IPS4 Site, mostly single-file downloads |\n| [ModDB](https://www.moddb.com/) | No | No | `directURL=https://www.moddb.com/downloads/start/{ID}` | `https://www.moddb.com/downloads/start/124908` | Downloads can be very slow |\n| [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) | No | Yes | `directURL=https://www.patreon.com/file?h={ID1}i={ID2}` | `directURL=https://www.patreon.com/file?h=34874668&i=5247431` | Only public downloads, paywalled downloads can not be downloaded |\n| [GitHub](https://github.com/) | No | No | `directURL=https://github.com/{USER}/{REPO}/releases/download/{TAG}/{FILE}` | `directURL=https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer/releases/download/v2.3.1/Mod.Organizer-2.3.1.7z` | |\n| [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) | No | Yes | `directURL=https://drive.google.com/file/d/{ID}` | `directURL=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1grLRTrpHxlg7VPxATTFNfq2OkU_Plvh_/` | Google Drive is known to not be a reliable file hosting service as a file can get temporarily inaccessible if too many users try to download it |\n| [MEGA](https://mega.nz/) | No (Optional) | Yes | `directURL=https://mega.nz/#!{ID}` | `directURL=https://mega.nz/#!CsMSFaaJ!-uziC4mbJPRy2e4pPk8Gjb3oDT_38Be9fzZ6Ld4NL-k` | MEGA has a 5GB transfer quota on non-premium users, even less for non-registered ones.

Sadly development was moving a bit too slowly for my liking, and I realized that a complete rewrite would allow the implementation of some really nice features (like BSA packing). As such I made the decision to strike out on my own and make an app that worked first, and then make it pretty. The end result is an app with a ton of features, and a less than professional UI. But that's my motto when coding \"_make it work, then make it pretty_\".\n\n**Can I charge for a Wabbajack Modlist I created?**\n\nNo, as specified in the [License](#license--copyright), Wabbajack Modlists must be available for free. Any payment in exchange for access to a Wabbajack installer is strictly prohibited. This includes paywalling, \"pay for beta access\", \"pay for current version, previous version is free\", or any sort of other quid-pro-quo monetization structure. The Wabbajack team reserves the right to implement software that will prohibit the installation of any lists that are paywalled.\n\n**Can I accept donations for my installer?**\n\nAbsolutely! As long as the act of donating does not entitle the donator to access to the installer. The installer must be free, donations must be a \"thank you\" - not a purchase of services or content.\n\n### For Mod Authors\n\n**How does Wabbajack download mods from the Nexus?**\n\nWabbajack uses the official [Nexus API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/NexusMods/nexus-mods_public_api_params_in_form_data/1.0#/) to retrieve download links from the Nexus. Mod Managers such as MO2 or Vortex also use this API to download files. Downloading using the API is the same as downloading directly from the website, both will increase your download count and give you donation points.\n\n**How can I opt out of having my mod be included in a Modlist?**\n\nAs explained before:\n\n> We use the official [Nexus API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/NexusMods/nexus-mods_public_api_params_in_form_data/1.0#/) to retrieve download links from the Nexus.\n\nEveryone who has access to the Nexus can download your mod. The Nexus does not and can not lock out Wabbajack from using the API to download a specific mod based on _author preferences_.\n\n**Will the end user even know they use my mod?**\n\nYour mod is exposed in several layers of the user experience when installing a Modlist. Before the installation even starts, the user has access to the manifest of the Modlist. This contains a list of all mods to be installed as well as the authors, version, size, links and more meta data depending on origin.\n\nWabbajack will start a Slideshow during installation which features all mods to be installed in random order. The Slideshow displays the title, author, main image, description, version and a link to the Nexus page.\n\nAfter installation the user most likely needs to check the instructions of the Modlist for recommended MCM options. If your mod has an MCM and needs a lot of configuring than your mod will likely be featured in the instructions.\n\nSome Modlists also have an extensive README and we highly encourage new Modlist Authors to add a section about important mods to their README (see [Post-Compilation](#post-compilation)).\n\n**What if my mod is not on the Nexus?**\n\nYou can check all sites we can download from [here](#meta-files) and we can easily add support for other sites. As long as your mod is publicly accessible and available on the Internet, Wabbajack can probably download it. Even if the site requires a login and does not have an API, we can always just resort to our internal browser and download the mod as if a user would go to the website using Firefox/Chrome and click the download button.\n\n## License & Copyright\n\nAll original code in Wabbajack is given freely via the [GPL3 license](LICENSE.txt). Parts of Wabbajack use libraries that carry their own Open Sources licenses, those parts retain their original copyrights. Selling of Modlist files is strictly forbidden. As is hosting the files behind any sort of paywall. You received this tool free of charge, respect this by giving freely as you were given.\n\n## Contributing\n\nLook at the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/halgari/wabbajack/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed guidelines.\n\n## Thanks to\n\nOur testers and Discord members who encourage development and help test the builds.\n"

Write a little bit of Ruby, define your deck's stats, then compile your game into a series of images ready for print-and-play or even print-on-demand. Squib is very data-driven and built on the principle of Don't Repeat Yourself. Think of it like [nanDeck](http://www.nand.it/nandeck/) done \"the Ruby way\". Squib supports:\n\n* A concise set of rules for laying out your cards\n* Loading PNGs and SVGs\n* Complex text rendering using [Pango](http://www.pango.org/)\n* Reading `xlsx` and `csv` files\n* Rendering to PNGs, PDFs, and SVGs (sheets or individual files)\n* Flexible, data-driven layouts in Yaml\n* Basic shape drawing, blending operators, gradients, etc.\n* Unit conversion\n* The full power of Ruby!\n\nSquib is based on the [Cairo](http://cairographics.org/) graphics rendering engine, the library of choice for WebKit, Gecko, Inkscape and many, many others.\n\nCheck this out.\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'squib'\n\nSquib::Deck.new(cards: 2) do\n  text str: %w(Hello World!)\n  save_png\nend\n```\n\nWe just created a 2-card deck with \"Hello\" on the first card, and \"World\" on the second, and saved them out to PNGs.\n\nWanna see more? Check out the website: http://andymeneely.github.io/squib/\n\n## Installation\n\nSquib requires Ruby 2.7 or later.\n\nInstall it yourself with:\n\n    $ gem install squib\n\nIf you're using Bundler, add this line to your application's Gemfile:\n\n    gem 'squib'\n\nAnd then execute:\n\n    $ bundle\n\nMore info: http://squib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nAfter installing Squib, you can create a project and run your first build like this:\n\n```sh\n$ squib new my-cool-game\n$ cd my-cool-game\n$ ruby deck.rb\n```\n\nThe `squib new` command will generate files and folders like this:\n\n```\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 .gitignore\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 ABOUT.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Gemfile\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 IDEAS.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 PLAYTESTING.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 PNP NOTES.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 RULES.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Rakefile\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 _output\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 gitkeep.txt\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 config.yml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 deck.rb\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 layout.yml\n\n12 files\n```\n\n\n# Learning Squib\n\nGo [read the docs!](http://squib.readthedocs.org/)\n\nAlso:\n* The `samples` directory in the [source repository](https://github.com/andymeneely/squib) has lots of examples.\n* [Masters of the Heist](http://mastersoftheheist.com) is my own creation, and it was made with Squib. Go through the repository and watch how it evolved!\n* [Junk Land](https://github.com/andymeneely/junk-land) is my own creation that's uses Squib for full-color rendering, and makes use of Ruby in a lot of interesting ways. The port is still in process.\n* [Project Spider Monkey](https://github.com/andymeneely/project-spider-monkey) is another of my own creations. This one was started from scratch with Squib, but it's still in its early stages.\n\n\n## Staying DRY\n\nSquib tries to keep you DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) with the following features:\n\n* Custom layouts allow you to specify various arguments in a separate file. This is great for x-y coordinates and alignment properties that would otherwise clutter up perfectly readable code. Squib goes even further and has a special \"extends\" that works especially well for grouped-together styles.\n* Flexible ranges and array handling: the `range` parameter in Squib is very flexible, meaning that one `text` command can specify different text in different fonts, styles, colors, etc. for each card. If you find yourself doing multiple `text` command for the same field across different ranges of cards, there's probably a better way to condense.\n* Custom colors keep you from hardcoding magic color strings everywhere. Custom colors go into `config.yml` file.\n* Plus, you know, Ruby.\n\n\n## Docker\n\nWant to run in a controlled environment? We've got a [Docker image on DockerHub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/andymeneely/repository/docker/andymeneely/squib)\n\nHere's one way to run it. On the command line, go to the root of your repository. With these commands, we'll map the current directory to the `/usr/src/app` directory in the Docker image. When squib-in-docker read & writes files from there, it'll write it back out to your current directory.\n\nAssuming you have a script called hello.rb:\n\nOn Windows:\n\n```\ndocker run --rm -v \"%cd%\":/usr/src/app andymeneely/squib ruby hello.rb\n```\n\nOn Macs:\n\n```\ndocker run --rm -v \"$PWD\":/usr/src/app andymeneely/squib ruby hello.rb\n```\n\nThis will create a folder called `_output` in your current directory and write the output of the script there.\n\nWe're still working on ways to customize your own Docker build (e.g. document building, custom fonts, etc.) with your own Dockerfile. Pull requests and ideas welcome!\n\n\n# Get Help and Give Help\n\nSee [this page](http://squib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/help.html)\n\n\n# What's up the with the name?\n\nTruthfully, I just thought it was a cool, simple word that was not used much in the Ruby community nor the board game community. But, now that I've committed to the name, I've realized that:\n\n* Squibs are small explosive devices, much like Squib \"explodes\" your rules into a playable game\n* Squibs are often used in heist movies, leading to a sudden plot twist that often resembles the twists of good tabletop game\n* Squibs are also part of the Harry Potter world - they are people who are non-magical but wizard-born. Squib is aware of wizarding magic and comes from that heritage, but it's not magical itself.\n"

Use the [PyBullet forums](http://pybullet.org) to discuss with others.\n\n## PyBullet ##\nIt is highly recommended to use PyBullet Python bindings for improved support for robotics, reinforcement learning and VR. Use pip install pybullet and checkout the [PyBullet Quickstart Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10sXEhzFRSnvFcl3XxNGhnD4N2SedqwdAvK3dsihxVUA/edit#heading=h.2ye70wns7io3).\n\nInstallation is simple:\n```\npip3 install pybullet --upgrade --user\npython3 -m pybullet_envs.examples.enjoy_TF_AntBulletEnv_v0_2017may\npython3 -m pybullet_envs.examples.enjoy_TF_HumanoidFlagrunHarderBulletEnv_v1_2017jul\npython3 -m pybullet_envs.deep_mimic.testrl --arg_file run_humanoid3d_backflip_args.txt\n```\n\nIf you use PyBullet in your research, please cite it like this:\n\n```\n@MISC{coumans2021,\nauthor =   {Erwin Coumans and Yunfei Bai},\ntitle =    {PyBullet, a Python module for physics simulation for games, robotics and machine learning},\nhowpublished = {\\url{http://pybullet.org}},\nyear = {2016--2021}\n}\n```\n\n## Requirements for Bullet Physics C++\n\nA C++ compiler for C++ 2003. The library is tested on Windows, Linux, Mac OSX, iOS, Android,\nbut should likely work on any platform with C++ compiler. \nSome optional demos require OpenGL 2 or OpenGL 3, there are some non-graphical demos and unit tests too.\n\n## Contributors and Coding Style information\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1u9vyzPtrVoVhYqQOGNWUgjRbfwfCdIts_NzmvgiJ144/edit\n\n## Requirements for experimental OpenCL GPGPU support\n\nThe entire collision detection and rigid body dynamics can be executed on the GPU.\n\nA high-end desktop GPU, such as an AMD Radeon 7970 or NVIDIA GTX 680 or better.\nWe succesfully tested the software under Windows, Linux and Mac OSX.\nThe software currently doesn't work on OpenCL CPU devices. It might run\non a laptop GPU but performance will not likely be very good. Note that\noften an OpenCL drivers fails to compile a kernel. Some unit tests exist to\ntrack down the issue, but more work is required to cover all OpenCL kernels.\n\n## License\n\nAll source code files are licensed under the permissive zlib license\n(http://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib) unless marked differently in a particular folder/file.\n\n## Build instructions for Bullet using vcpkg\n\nYou can download and install Bullet using the [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/) dependency manager:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git\n    cd vcpkg\n    ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh\n    ./vcpkg integrate install\n    ./vcpkg install bullet3\n\nThe Bullet port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors. If the version is out of date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on the vcpkg repository.\n\n## Build instructions for Bullet using premake. You can also use cmake instead.\n\n**Windows**\n\nClick on build_visual_studio_vr_pybullet_double.bat and open build3/vs2010/0_Bullet3Solution.sln\nWhen asked, convert the projects to a newer version of Visual Studio.\nIf you installed Python in the C:\\ root directory, the batch file should find it automatically.\nOtherwise, edit this batch file to choose where Python include/lib directories are located.\n\n**Windows Virtual Reality sandbox for HTC Vive and Oculus Rift**\n\nBuild and run the App_SharedMemoryPhysics_VR project, preferably in Release/optimized build.\nYou can connect from Python pybullet to the sandbox using:\n\n```\nimport pybullet as p\np.connect(p.SHARED_MEMORY) #or (p.TCP, \"localhost\", 6667) or (p.UDP, \"192.168.86.10\",1234)\n```\n\n**Linux and Mac OSX gnu make**\n\nMake sure cmake is installed (sudo apt-get install cmake, brew install cmake, or https://cmake.org)\n\nIn a terminal type:\n```\n./build_cmake_pybullet_double.sh\n```\nThis script will invoke cmake and build in the build_cmake directory. You can find pybullet in Bullet/examples/pybullet.\nThe BulletExampleBrowser binary will be in Bullet/examples/ExampleBrowser.\n\nYou can also build Bullet using premake. There are premake executables in the build3 folder.\nDepending on your system (Linux 32bit, 64bit or Mac OSX) use one of the following lines\nUsing premake:\n```\ncd build3\n./premake4_linux --double gmake\n./premake4_linux64 --double gmake\n./premake4_osx --double --enable_pybullet gmake\n```\nThen\n```\ncd gmake\nmake\n```\n\nNote that on Linux, you need to use cmake to build pybullet, since the compiler has issues of mixing shared and static libraries.\n\n**Mac OSX Xcode**\n\t\nClick on build3/xcode4.command or in a terminal window execute\n```\t\n./premake_osx xcode4\n```\n## Usage\n\nThe App_ExampleBrowser executables will be located in the bin folder.\nYou can just run it though a terminal/command prompt, or by clicking it.\n\n\n```\n[--start_demo_name=\"Demo Name\"]     Start with a selected demo  \n[--mp4=moviename.mp4]               Create a mp4 movie of the window, requires ffmpeg installed\n[--mouse_move_multiplier=0.400000]  Set the mouse move sensitivity\n[--mouse_wheel_multiplier=0.01]     Set the mouse wheel sensitivity\n[--background_color_red= 0.9]       Set the red component for background color. Same for green and blue\n[--fixed_timestep= 0.0]             Use either a real-time delta time (0.0) or a fixed step size (0.016666)\n```\n\nYou can use mouse picking to grab objects. When holding the ALT or CONTROL key, you have Maya style camera mouse controls.\nPress F1 to create a series of screenshots. Hit ESCAPE to exit the demo app.\n\nCheck out the docs folder and the Bullet physics forums for further information.\n"

It can be used in Unity as well as in other .NET environments such as console applications.\n\nRiptide provides functionality for establishing connections and sending data back and forth, leaving it up to you to decide what data you want to send and when, which is ideal if you like to be in control of your code and know what's going on under the hood.\n\nRiptide is 100% free to use and only funded by [donations](https://github.com/sponsors/tom-weiland).\n\nFor a tutorial on how to set up Riptide in your project, see [this video](https://youtu.be/6kWNZOFcFQw).\n\n## Installation\n### Unity\nUsing Unity's Package Manager:\n1. Open the Package Manager (Window > Package Manager)\n2. Click the '+' (plus) button in the top left corner of the window\n3. Select the 'Add package from git URL...' option\n4. Enter the following base URL: `https://github.com/tom-weiland/RiptideNetworking.git?path=/UnityPackage#v1.2.0` and then append the version number you'd like to install. For example, if you want to install v1.2.0, you would enter `https://github.com/tom-weiland/RiptideNetworking.git?path=/UnityPackage#v1.2.0` as the full URL\n5. Click 'Add' and wait for Riptide to be installed\n\nAlternatively, you can grab the RiptideNetworking.dll file (and RiptideNetworking.xml file for intellisense documentation) from the [latest release](https://github.com/tom-weiland/RiptideNetworking/releases/latest) and simply drop it into your Unity project.\n\n### Other\nIf you aren't using Unity, you can add the RiptideNetworking.dll file to your project as a project reference:\n1. Download RiptideNetworking.dll file from the [latest release](https://github.com/tom-weiland/RiptideNetworking/releases/latest)\n2. Right click your project in Visual Studio's Solution Explorer\n3. Select 'Add' and then select the 'Project Reference...' option\n4. Click 'Browse' in the left sidebar of the window\n5. Click the 'Browse' button in the bottom right corner of the window\n6. Navigate to the folder where you saved the RiptideNetworking.dll file and add it\n\n## Getting Started\nFor a tutorial on how to set up Riptide in your project, see [this video](https://youtu.be/6kWNZOFcFQw).\n\n### Project Considerations\nIf you are making a player-hosted game (sometimes mistakenly referred to as \"peer-to-peer\") where one player acts as the server, you'll want all your code in a single project.\n\nHowever, if you intend to build a standalone server, having separate projects for the server and client may be helpful.\n\nRiptide supports either of those (and more) architecture choices.\n\n### Initial Setup\nSet up a `NetworkManager` class like in the [Unity demo projects](Demos/Unity). To run your own logic when certain things happen, you can subscribe to the following events:\n- Server\n  - `ClientConnected` - invoked when a new client connects\n  - `MessageReceived` - invoked when a message is received from a client (useful if you need to run custom logic for _every_ message that is received)\n  - `ClientDisconnected` - invoked when a client disconnects\n- Client\n  - `Connected` - invoked when a connection to the server is established\n  - `ConnectionFailed` - invoked when a connection to the server fails to be established\n  - `MessageReceived` - invoked when a message is received from a client (useful if you need to run custom logic for _every_ message that is received)\n  - `Disconnected` - invoked when disconnected by the server\n  - `ClientConnected` - invoked when another client connects\n  - `ClientDisonnected` - invoked when another client disconnects\n\nAdditionally, you can set up a `MessageExtensions` class to extend the functionality of the `Message` class. This is helpful if you wish to send custom objects over the network\u2014being able to directly Add/Get a `Vector3` from a message is much more convenient than having to call the Add/GetFloat method 3 times in a row. Refer to the [Unity demos](Demos/Unity) for an example.\n\nNote that if you installed Riptide via the Unity package manager, `Message` extension methods for several types (including `Vector3` and `Quaternion`) are [already included](Unity/Packages/Core/Runtime/MessageExtensions.cs).\n\n### Creating and Sending Messages\nMessages are created like this:\n```cs\nMessage message = Message.Create(<messageSendMode>, <messageId>);\n```\n`<messageSendMode>` should be set to either `MessageSendMode.reliable` or `MessageSendMode.unreliable`, depending on how you want your message to be sent.<br/>\n`<messageId>` should be set to the message's ID (a `ushort`). This ID will allow the other end to determine how to handle the message upon receiving it.\n\nTo add data to your message, use:\n```cs\nmessage.Add(someValue);\n```\n`someValue` can be any of the following types (or an array of that type): `byte`, `bool`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, `float`, `double`, `string`\n\nAny custom types you may want to send usually consist of combinations of these primitive types. For example, a `Vector3` consists of 3 `float`s, so instead of literally sending the `Vector3` itself, you would send the x, y, and z, components as 3 separate `float`s (as mentioned above, you can extend the `Message` class to make this less cumbersome).\n\nTo send your message, use one of the following:\n```cs\nServer.Send(message, <toClientId>); // Sends message from server to 1 client\nServer.SendToAll(message); // Sends message from server to all clients\nServer.SendToAll(message, <toClientId>); // Sends message from server to all clients except one\nClient.Send(message); // Sends message from client to server\n```\n`<toClientId>` should be set to the ID (a `ushort`) of the client you want the server to send\u2014or not send, in the case of the SendToAll method\u2014the message to. \n\n### Handling Messages\nTo handle messages, simply create a static method and give it the MessageHandler attribute:\n```cs\n[MessageHandler(<someMessageFromServerID>)]\nprivate static void HandleSomeMessageFromServer(Message message)\n{\n    int someInt = message.GetInt();\n    bool someBool = message.GetBool();\n    float[] someFloats = message.GetFloats();\n    \n    // Do stuff with the retrieved data here\n}\n```\n`<someMessageFromServerID>` should be set to the ID (a `ushort`) of the message you want this method to handle.\n\nA few things to note:\n- to ensure that messages are actually handled, you _must_ regularly call the Tick method of the Server/Client instance you're using. If you're using Unity, FixedUpdate is a good place to do this\n- when retrieving values from messages, ***ORDER MATTERS!*** If you added a `short` followed by a `float` when creating/sending the message, you must call `message.GetShort` and `message.GetFloat` _in that same order_ when handling the message, otherwise you won't get the same values out that you put in\n- message handler methods need to be `static`\n\n## Low-Level Transports\n- [UDP Transport](RiptideNetworking/RiptideNetworking/Transports/Udp) (built-in)\n- [Steam Transport](https://github.com/tom-weiland/RiptideSteamTransport) (in development)\n\n## Donate\nRiptide is 100% free to use, but if you'd like to financially support its development as well as the development of its various transports, you can do so via [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/tom-weiland) or on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/tomweiland).\n\n## License\nDistributed under the MIT license.

  "readme_contents": "Games for the AttinyArcade (or hardware inspired by this system)\n================================================================\n\nBy Andy Jackson - Twitter: @andyhighnumber\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe games in this folder can mostly be played either on the AttinyArcade, or similar hardware (if the hardware is different, there will be a circuit diagram in the same folder as the game).\n\nInfo on programming the Attiny85 chip can be found online, here's an example: https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/arjun/programming-attiny85-with-arduino-uno-afb829 - don't forget to burn the bootloader (it's a menu option under 'Tools' on the Arduino IDE) the first time you flash the chip and if you need to change between 8Mhz and 16Mhz clocks (all my games are 8Mhz, except Pacman which is 16Mhz).\n\nSee www.webboggles.com for details of the AttinyArcade hardware.\n\nThese games are based on the Attiny85 device running at 8Mhz on its internal clock, or 16Mhz for pac-man (don't forget to burn the bootloader when you first flash a new chip- the option to do this is in the \"Tools\" menu on the Arduino IDE).\n\nIn this folder:\n\nFor the standard Attiny Arcade Hardware, or enhanced functionality on custom hardware\n=====================================================================================\n- Pacman_Attiny_Arcade: PacMan clone for the original Attiny. This is the best of the lot in my opinion. Unlike the other games here, this needs to be flashed with a 16Mhz internal clock bootloader (all the others are 8MHz). Send me a message via twitter if this presents any problems.\n- SpaceAttackAttiny: Space Invaders clone for the original Attiny (also allows for modified version of hardware with fire button - see circuit diagram in folder)\n- Frogger_Attiny_Arcade: Frogger clone for the original Attiny (also allows modified version of hardware with jump button - same hardware config as SpaceAttack above - see schematic in folder)\n- MorseAttinyArcade: A morse code decoder (for practicing morse, if you so wish), which displays inputted code via a 5-line scrolling display. When combined with a PLL (or similar) tone detection circuit, this could easily decode off-air morse.\n\nFor the standard Attiny Arcade Hardware\n=======================================\n- WrenRollercoasterAttinyArcade: Inspired by the TinyWings iOS game - fly a wren along a landscape as far as you can! \n- Attiny Tetris: A Tetris clone, evolved from a game for the Arduino by Anthony Russell (https://github.com/AJRussell/Tiny-Tetris)\n- UFO_Stacker_Attiny: Two games in one sketch - UFO (from www.webboggles.com) and Stacker (from me).\n- UFO_Breakout_Arduino: Again - two games in one sketch, both from www.webboggles.com, UFO and Breakout\n- BatBonanzaAttinyArcade: A version of Pong for the standard AttinyHardware - not as playable because you really need analog control for this type of game - see below\n\nFor the MAKERbuino (https://www.makerbuino.com/)\n=======================================\n- PAK-MAN_MAKERbuino: Port of the PAC-MAN AttinyArcade game to the MAKERBUINO / GAMEBUINO platform \n- FROGGER_MAKERbuino: Port of the Frogger AttinyArcade game to the MAKERBUINO / GAMEBUINO platform \n\nFor custom hardware - see circuit schematics in the folders with the sketches\n=============================================================================\n- BatBonanzaAnalog: Pong clone based on custom hardware with analog controls (will work on the same hardware as Space Attack Anlog Version).\n- Space_Attack_Analog: Space Invaders clone (sort of) based on custom hardware with analog control (will work on the same hardware as Bat Bonanza Anlog Version).\n- BatBonanzaAnalogSinglePot: Pong clone based on custom hardware with single-pot analog control (will work on the same hardware as Space Attack Anlog Version).\n- Tetris_Multi_Button: A Tetris cline, as above but designed for multi-button pad (see circuit schematic in folder for details of the hardware)\n"

You can reate new folders in userdata/studio/pose and place the pose data inside them and those folders will show up in your list of poses in Studio. It also saves poses as .png files instead of .dat so you see can see what the content of the pose is. The list of poses is ordered by filename and the pose name is added to the file name so the list will be ordered alphabetically. It also saves skirt FK and facial expressions, though these can be disabled in plugin settings if you prefer.\n\nPorted from Essu's NEOpose List Folders plugin for Honey Select.\n\n#### ListOverride\n\n- [KK_ListOverride]\n- [KKS_ListOverride]\n\nAllows you to override vanilla list files. Comes with some overrides that enable half off state for some vanilla pantyhose.\n\nOverriding list files can allow you to do things like enable bras with some shirts which don't normally allow it, or skirts with some tops, etc. Any part of of the list can be changed except for ID.\n\n#### HairAccessoryCustomizer\n\n- [EC_HairAccessoryCustomizer]\n- [KK_HairAccessoryCustomizer]\n- [KKS_HairAccessoryCustomizer]\n\nAdds configuration options for hair accessories to the character maker.

Hairs that support a length slider can also have their length adjusted, just like vanilla front hairs. Saves and loads to cards and coordinates.\n\n**Note for modders**: These options will only show up for hair accessories that are properly configured. For accessories to work the accessory must have a\t\t`ChaCustomHairComponent` MonoBehavior in addition to the `ChaAccessoryComponent` MonoBehavior. Hair accessory color will display if the ChaCustomHairComponent rendAccessory array has meshes configured. The length slider will appear if the `ChaCustomHairComponent.trfLength` array has bones configured. Hair color will only match to meshes configured in the `ChaCustomHairComponent.rendHair` array. Also check out [this guide](https://github.com/IllusionMods/KK_Plugins/wiki/Hair-Accessory-Guide) for how to create hair accessories.\n\n<details><summary>Change Log</summary>\nv1.1 Fixed a bug with changing coordinates outside of Studio not applying color matching.

Much like [Marco's clothing overlays](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/Koikatu-Overlay-Mods) you can replace the texture of an item, however with MaterialEditor you can edit much more than clothes. Edit clothes, accessories, hair, and even Studio items.\n\nFeatures:\n* Export UV maps of a mesh to help with drawing textures\n* Replace nearly any texture with custom textures\n* Change properties of materials to control things like shininess or outline thickness\n* Change properties of the mesh to affect whether it casts shadows or disable a mesh completely\n* Change the shader of a material\n* All changes save and load with the card or Studio scene\n* Duplicate textures are saved to the card once. 100 accessories with the same texture have the same file size as one accessory with a texture\n\nAccess the Material Editor by pressing the \"Open Material Editor\" button on clothes, hair, or accessories in the character maker.

  "readme_contents": "# Unium\n> A library for game automation.\n\nUnium is an library for [unity](https://unity.com/) that facilities automation. It exposes an HTTP API that can be used for tools or testing.\n\nThere are two parts:\n\n* A web server that is embedded into the game\n* A query language sits on top that lets you search and manipulate the scene graph\n\nThis provides a flexible interface so you can remotely control and inspect your game as it runs. If necessary, you can add your own endpoints to the underlying web server to do custom operations.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### The Tutorial\n\nFor the tutorial\n\n* Clone the [unium repository](https://github.com/gwaredd/unium/)\n* Open the project in Unity\n* Open the Tutorial scene in the editor\n* Hit play\n\nYour default browser should open automatically.\n\nThe tutorial is best experienced with the editor and browser side-by-side. \n\nDocumentation can be found in [unium.pdf](https://github.com/gwaredd/unium/blob/master/Assets/Unium/unium.pdf). \n\nSee also the [FAQ](https://github.com/gwaredd/unium/wiki/FAQ)\n\n### For Your Project\n\nThere are several ways of installing the unium library in your project.\n\nThe preferred approach\n\n* Use the unity package manager (see below)\n\nAlternatively you can\n\n* Copy the `Assets/Unium` folder directly into your project\n* Download it from the [asset store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/unium-automated-test-tools-95998)\n* Or, install one of the [release packages](https://github.com/gwaredd/unium/releases)\n\n**NB:** Remember to enable the `development build` flag if you are making builds (unium is disabled for release by default).\n\n### Package Manager\n\nAs of `v1.0.4` you can use the unity packaging to add unium directly.\n\nYou can now [import unium as a git package using UPM](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-git.html). With Unity 2020.1 or later, you can point to the github repository in your `Packages/manifest.json` dependencies. You can optionally pin to a specific version of unium by adding a revision or tag to this url as per the above documentation.\n\n```\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"com.gwaredd.unium\": \"https://github.com/gwaredd/unium.git?path=/Assets/Unium\",\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor earlier versions of Unity that do not support sub folders in git dependencies, the `upm` branch of the repository contains just the library setup for use with the [package manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.package-manager-ui@1.8/manual/index.html). Note that this version might not contain all latest fixes and improvements.\n\n## Notes\n\n### Writing Tests\n\nThe Unium API facilitates automated tests but is not a testing framework. Below are a number of popular frameworks that have been used with Unium.\n\n* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) - JavaScript\n* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - JavaScript\n* [PyTest](https://pytest.org) - Python\n* [RSpec](https://rspec.info/) - Ruby\n* [SpecFlow](https://specflow.org/) - C#\n* [JUnit](https://junit.org/) - Java\n\nExamples can be found in the [Examples](https://github.com/gwaredd/unium/tree/master/Examples) folder.\n\n### Compatibility\n\n* Compatible with Unity 2017.4.30 and up\n* The aim to is to keep it compatible with the lowest LTS version officially supported by Unity\n\n\n\n### Tutorial Video\n\n[![Unium Tutorial Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/7mTaPr2oaG4/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mTaPr2oaG4 \"Unium Tutorial Video\")\n\n### Demonstration of Unium and Appium working together\n\n[![Unium with Appium](http://img.youtube.com/vi/UbPk2VljW78/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/UbPk2VljW78 \"Unium with Appium\")\n\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Dolphin - A GameCube and Wii Emulator\n\n[Homepage](https://dolphin-emu.org/) | [Project Site](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin) | [Buildbot](https://dolphin.ci) | [Forums](https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/) | [Wiki](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/) | [Issue Tracker](https://bugs.dolphin-emu.org/projects/emulator/issues) | [Coding Style](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/blob/master/Contributing.md) | [Transifex Page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/dolphin-emu/)\n\nDolphin is an emulator for running GameCube and Wii games on Windows,\nLinux, macOS, and recent Android devices. It's licensed under the terms\nof the GNU General Public License, version 2 or later (GPLv2+).\n\nPlease read the [FAQ](https://dolphin-emu.org/docs/faq/) before using Dolphin.\n\n## System Requirements\n\n### Desktop\n\n* OS\n    * Windows (10 or higher).\n    * Linux.\n    * macOS (10.14 Mojave or higher).\n    * Unix-like systems other than Linux are not officially supported but might work.\n* Processor\n    * A CPU with SSE2 support.\n    * A modern CPU (3 GHz and Dual Core, not older than 2008) is highly recommended.\n* Graphics\n    * A reasonably modern graphics card (Direct3D 11.1 / OpenGL 3.3).\n    * A graphics card that supports Direct3D 11.1 / OpenGL 4.4 is recommended.\n\n### Android\n\n* OS\n    * Android (5.0 Lollipop or higher).\n* Processor\n    * A processor with support for 64-bit applications (either ARMv8 or x86-64).\n* Graphics\n    * A graphics processor that supports OpenGL ES 3.0 or higher. Performance varies heavily with [driver quality](https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2013/09/26/dolphin-emulator-and-opengl-drivers-hall-fameshame/).\n    * A graphics processor that supports standard desktop OpenGL features is recommended for best performance.\n\nDolphin can only be installed on devices that satisfy the above requirements. Attempting to install on an unsupported device will fail and display an error message.\n\n## Building for Windows\n\nUse the solution file `Source/dolphin-emu.sln` to build Dolphin on Windows.\nVisual Studio 2022 17.2.3 or later is a hard requirement. Other compilers might be\nable to build Dolphin on Windows but have not been tested and are not\nrecommended to be used. Git and Windows 11 SDK must be installed when building.\n\nMake sure to pull submodules before building:\n```sh\ngit submodule update --init\n```\n\nThe \"Release\" solution configuration includes performance optimizations for the best user experience but complicates debugging Dolphin.\nThe \"Debug\" solution configuration is significantly slower, more verbose and less permissive but makes debugging Dolphin easier.\n\nAn installer can be created by using the `Installer.nsi` script in the\nInstaller directory. This will require the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System\n(NSIS) to be installed. Creating an installer is not necessary to run Dolphin\nsince the Binary directory contains a working Dolphin distribution.\n\n## Building for Linux and macOS\n\nDolphin requires [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for systems other than Windows. Many libraries are\nbundled with Dolphin and used if they're not installed on your system. CMake\nwill inform you if a bundled library is used or if you need to install any\nmissing packages yourself.\n\nMake sure to pull submodules before building:\n```sh\ngit submodule update --init\n```\n\n### macOS Build Steps:\n\nA binary supporting a single architecture can be built using the following steps: \n\n1. `mkdir build`\n2. `cd build`\n3. `cmake ..`\n4. `make`\n\nAn application bundle will be created in `./Binaries`.\n\nA script is also provided to build universal binaries supporting both x64 and ARM in the same\napplication bundle using the following steps:\n\n1. `mkdir build`\n2. `cd build`\n3. `python ../BuildMacOSUniversalBinary.py`\n4. Universal binaries will be available in the `universal` folder\n\nDoing this is more complex as it requires installation of library dependencies for both x64 and ARM (or universal library\nequivalents) and may require specifying additional arguments to point to relevant library locations. \nExecute BuildMacOSUniversalBinary.py --help for more details.  \n\n### Linux Global Build Steps:\n\nTo install to your system.\n\n1. `mkdir build`\n2. `cd build`\n3. `cmake ..`\n4. `make`\n5. `sudo make install`\n\n### Linux Local Build Steps:\n\nUseful for development as root access is not required.\n\n1. `mkdir Build`\n2. `cd Build`\n3. `cmake .. -DLINUX_LOCAL_DEV=true`\n4. `make`\n5. `ln -s ../../Data/Sys Binaries/`\n\n### Linux Portable Build Steps:\n\nCan be stored on external storage and used on different Linux systems.\nOr useful for having multiple distinct Dolphin setups for testing/development/TAS.\n\n1. `mkdir Build`\n2. `cd Build`\n3. `cmake .. -DLINUX_LOCAL_DEV=true`\n4. `make`\n5. `cp -r ../Data/Sys/ Binaries/`\n6. `touch Binaries/portable.txt`\n\n## Building for Android\n\nThese instructions assume familiarity with Android development. If you do not have an\nAndroid dev environment set up, see [AndroidSetup.md](AndroidSetup.md).\n\nMake sure to pull submodules before building:\n```sh\ngit submodule update --init\n```\n\nIf using Android Studio, import the Gradle project located in `./Source/Android`.\n\nAndroid apps are compiled using a build system called Gradle. Dolphin's native component,\nhowever, is compiled using CMake. The Gradle script will attempt to run a CMake build\nautomatically while building the Java code.\n\n## Uninstalling\n\nWhen Dolphin has been installed with the NSIS installer, you can uninstall\nDolphin like any other Windows application.\n\nLinux users can run `cat install_manifest.txt | xargs -d '\\n' rm` as root from the build directory\nto uninstall Dolphin from their system.\n\nmacOS users can simply delete Dolphin.app to uninstall it.\n\nAdditionally, you'll want to remove the global user directory (see below to\nsee where it's stored) if you don't plan to reinstall Dolphin.\n\n## Command Line Usage\n\n`Usage: Dolphin [-h] [-d] [-l] [-e <str>] [-b] [-v <str>] [-a <str>]`\n\n* -h, --help Show this help message\n* -d, --debugger Show the debugger pane and additional View menu options\n* -l, --logger Open the logger\n* -e, --exec=<str> Load the specified file (DOL,ELF,WAD,GCM,ISO)\n* -b, --batch Exit Dolphin with emulator\n* -v, --video_backend=<str> Specify a video backend\n* -a, --audio_emulation=<str> Low level (LLE) or high level (HLE) audio\n\nAvailable DSP emulation engines are HLE (High Level Emulation) and\nLLE (Low Level Emulation). HLE is faster but less accurate whereas\nLLE is slower but close to perfect. Note that LLE has two submodes (Interpreter and Recompiler)\nbut they cannot be selected from the command line.\n\nAvailable video backends are \"D3D\" and \"D3D12\" (they are only available on Windows), \"OGL\", and \"Vulkan\".\nThere's also \"Null\", which will not render anything, and\n\"Software Renderer\", which uses the CPU for rendering and\nis intended for debugging purposes only.\n\n## Sys Files\n\n* `wiitdb.txt`: Wii title database from [GameTDB](https://www.gametdb.com/)\n* `totaldb.dsy`: Database of symbols (for devs only)\n* `GC/font_western.bin`: font dumps\n* `GC/font_japanese.bin`: font dumps\n* `GC/dsp_coef.bin`: DSP dumps\n* `GC/dsp_rom.bin`: DSP dumps\n* `Wii/clientca.pem`: Wii network certificate\n* `Wii/clientcakey.pem`: Wii network certificate key\n* `Wii/rootca.pem`: Wii network certificate issuer / CA\n\nThe DSP dumps included with Dolphin have been written from scratch and do not\ncontain any copyrighted material. They should work for most purposes, however\nsome games implement copy protection by checksumming the dumps. You will need\nto dump the DSP files from a console and replace the default dumps if you want\nto fix those issues.\n\nWii network certificates must be extracted from a Wii IOS. A guide for that can be found [here](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Wii_Network_Guide).\n\n## Folder Structure\n\nThese folders are installed read-only and should not be changed:\n\n* `GameSettings`: per-game default settings database\n* `GC`: DSP and font dumps\n* `Shaders`: post-processing shaders\n* `Themes`: icon themes for GUI\n* `Resources`: icons that are theme-agnostic\n* `Wii`: default Wii NAND contents\n\n## Packaging and udev\n\nThe Data folder contains a udev rule file for the official GameCube controller\nadapter and the Mayflash DolphinBar. Package maintainers can use that file in their packages for Dolphin.\nUsers compiling Dolphin on Linux can also just copy the file to their udev\nrules folder.\n\n## User Folder Structure\n\nA number of user writeable directories are created for caching purposes or for\nallowing the user to edit their contents. On macOS and Linux these folders are\nstored in `~/Library/Application Support/Dolphin/` and `~/.dolphin-emu`\nrespectively, but can be overwritten by setting the environment variable\n`DOLPHIN_EMU_USERPATH`. On Windows the user directory is stored in the `My Documents`\nfolder by default, but there are various way to override this behavior:\n\n* Creating a file called `portable.txt` next to the Dolphin executable will\n  store the user directory in a local directory called \"User\" next to the\n  Dolphin executable.\n* If the registry string value `LocalUserConfig` exists in\n  `HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Dolphin Emulator` and has the value **1**,\n  Dolphin will always start in portable mode.\n* If the registry string value `UserConfigPath` exists in\n  `HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Dolphin Emulator`, the user folders will be\n  stored in the directory given by that string. The other two methods will be\n  prioritized over this setting.\n\nList of user folders:\n\n* `Cache`: used to cache the ISO list\n* `Config`: configuration files\n* `Dump`: anything dumped from Dolphin\n* `GameConfig`: additional settings to be applied per-game\n* `GC`: memory cards and system BIOS\n* `Load`: custom textures\n* `Logs`: logs, if enabled\n* `ScreenShots`: screenshots taken via Dolphin\n* `StateSaves`: save states\n* `Wii`: Wii NAND contents\n\n## Custom Textures\n\nCustom textures have to be placed in the user directory under\n`Load/Textures/[GameID]/`. You can find the Game ID by right-clicking a game\nin the ISO list and selecting \"ISO Properties\".\n"

In \nsuch games, the agents are trained to communicate with each other and jointly solve a task. Often, the way they communicate is not explicitly determined, allowing agents to come up with their own 'language' in order to solve the task.\nSuch setup opens a plethora of possibilities in studying emergent language and the impact of the nature of task being solved, the agents' models, etc. This subject is a vibrant area of research often considered as a prerequisite for general AI. The purpose of EGG is to offer researchers an easy and fast entry point into this research area.\n\nEGG is based on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and provides: (a) simple, yet powerful components for implementing \ncommunication between agents, (b) a diverse set of pre-implemented games, (c) an interface to analyse the emergent \ncommunication protocols.\n\nKey features:\n * Primitives for implementing a single-symbol or variable-length, discrete or continuous communication (with vanilla FFNs, RNNs, GRUs, LSTMs or Transformers);\n * Support for a single pair as well as a population of interacting agents;\n * Training with optimization of the communication channel with REINFORCE or Gumbel-Softmax relaxation via a common interface;\n * Simplified configuration of the general components, such as checkpointing, optimization, tensorboard support, etc;\n * Provides a simple CUDA-aware command-line tool for grid-search over parameters of the games.\n\nTo fully leverage EGG one would need at least [a high-level familiarity](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html)\nwith PyTorch. However, to get a taste of communication games without writing any code, you could try [a dataset-based game](/egg/zoo/external_game), which allow you to experiment with different signaling games by simply editing input files. \n\n## List of implemented games\n\n<details><summary>List of example and tutorial games</summary><p>\n \n * [`MNIST autoencoder tutorial`](/tutorials/EGG%20walkthrough%20with%20a%20MNIST%20autoencoder.ipynb): A Jupyter tutorial that implements a MNIST discrete auto-encoder step-by-step, covering the basic concepts of EGG. The tutorial starts with pre-training a \"vision\" module and builds single- and multiple symbol auto-encoder communication games with channel optimization done by Reinforce and Gumbel-Softmax relaxation ([notebook](/tutorials/EGG%20walkthrough%20with%20a%20MNIST%20autoencoder.ipynb) / [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/EGG/blob/main/tutorials/EGG%20walkthrough%20with%20a%20MNIST%20autoencoder.ipynb)).\n \n* [`egg/zoo/basic_games`](/egg/zoo/basic_games): Simple implementations of reconstruction and discrimination games, taking their inputs from text files, and with thoroughly annotated code. These might be a good starting point to learn to play with EGG.\n \n * [`egg/zoo/signal_game`](/egg/zoo/signal_game): Modern version of a Lewis' signaling game. In this game, Sender is presented with a target image and with one or more distractor images. Then all images are shuffled and Receiver has to point to the target image based on a message from Sender. This implementation is based on Diane Bouchacourt's code.\n \n * [`egg/zoo/simple_autoenc`](/egg/zoo/simple_autoenc): Discrete auto-encoder Sender/Receiver game that auto-encodes one-hot vectors using variable-length messages.\n * [`egg/zoo/mnist_autoenc`](/egg/zoo/mnist_autoenc): Discrete MNIST auto-encoder game. In this Sender/Receiver game, Sender looks onto a MNIST image and sends a single symbol to Receiver, who tries to recover the image.\n  * [`egg/zoo/mnist_vae`](/egg/zoo/mnist_vae): Continuous-message VAE cast as an auto-encoder game. In this Sender/Receiver (Encoder/Decoder) game, Sender looks onto a MNIST image and sends a multi-dimensional vector to Receiver, who tries to recover the image.\n * [`egg/zoo/summation`](/egg/zoo/summation): Sender and Receiver are jointly trained to recognize the `a^nb^n` grammar: Sender reads an input sequence and Receiver answers if the sequence belongs to the grammar. Which agent actually counts, Sender or Receiver? Does Sender make the decision and send it to Receiver? Or does Sender encode the incoming sequence in the message and it is Receiver that make the decision? Or something in-between?\n * [`egg/zoo/external_game`](/egg/zoo/external_game): A signaling game that takes inputs and ground-truth outputs from CSV files. \n</p></details>\n\n <details><summary>Games used in published work</summary><p>\n \n  * [`egg/zoo/channel`](/egg/zoo/channel): _Anti-efficient encoding in emergent communication._ Rahma Chaabouni, Eugene Kharitonov, Emmanuel Dupoux, Marco Baroni.

Submit an issue if there is something you want to have implemented and included.\n\nMore details on each game's command line parameters are provided in the games' directories.\n\n### An important technical point\n\nEGG supports Reinforce and Gumbel-Softmax optimization of the *communication channel*. Currently, Gumbel-Softmax-based optimization is only supported if the game *loss* is differentiable. The [MNIST autoencoder game tutorial](/tutorials/EGG%20walkthrough%20with%20a%20MNIST%20autoencoder.ipynb) illustrates both Reinforce and Gumbel-Softmax channel optimization when using a differentiable game loss. The [signaling game](/egg/zoo/signal_game) has a non-differentiable game loss, and the communication channel is optimized with Reinforce.\n\n## Installing EGG\n\nGenerally, we assume that you use PyTorch 1.1.0 or newer and Python 3.6 or newer. \n\n 1. (optional) It is a good idea to develop in a new conda environment, e.g. like this:\n    ```\n    conda create --name egg36 python=3.6\n    conda activate egg36\n    ```\n 2. EGG can be installed as a package to be used as a library\n    ```\n    pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/facebookresearch/EGG.git\n    ```\n    or via https\n    ```\n    pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/EGG.git\n    ```\n    Alternatively, EGG can be cloned and installed in editable mode, so that the copy can be changed:\n    ```\n    git clone git@github.com:facebookresearch/EGG.git && cd EGG\n    pip install --editable .\n    ```\n 3.\n    Then, we can run a game, e.g. the MNIST auto-encoding game:\n    ```bash\n    python -m egg.zoo.mnist_autoenc.train --vocab=10 --n_epochs=50\n    ```\n\n## EGG structure\n\nThe repo is organised as follows:\n```\n- tests # tests for the common components\n- docs # documentation for EGG\n- egg\n-- core # common components: trainer, wrappers, games, utilities, ...\n-- zoo  # pre-implemented games \n-- nest # a tool for hyperparameter grid search\n```\n\n## How-to-Start and Learning more\n* Our EMNLP'19 Demo [paper](https://aclanthology.org/D19-3010/) provides a high-level view of the toolkit and points to further resources.\n* The step-by-step [`MNIST autoencoder tutorial`](/tutorials/EGG%20walkthrough%20with%20a%20MNIST%20autoencoder.ipynb) goes over all essential steps to create a full-featured communication game with variable length messages between the agents. NB: depending on your computational resources, this might take a while to run! [(open in colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/EGG/blob/main/tutorials/EGG%20walkthrough%20with%20a%20MNIST%20autoencoder.ipynb)\n* The simplest starter code is in [`egg/zoo/basic_games`](/egg/zoo/basic_games), providing implementations of basic reconstruction and discrimination games. Input can be provided through text files, and the code is thoroughly commented.\n* Another good starting point to implement a Sender/Receiver game is the MNIST autoencoder\ngame, [MNIST auto-encoder game](/egg/zoo/mnist_autoenc). The game features both Gumbel-Softmax \nand Reinforce-based implementations.\n* A template for a game is provided in [`egg/zoo/template`](/egg/zoo/template).\n* EGG can be used for autoencoder-based experiments or even self-supervised learning. An implementation of SimCLR introduce in Chen et al. 2020 can be found in [`egg/zoo/simclr`](/egg/zoo/simclr).\n* EGG provides some utility boilerplate around commonly used command line parameters. Documentation about using it can be found\n[here](docs/CL.md).\n* A brief how-to for tensorboard is [here](docs/tensorboard.md).\n* To learn more about the provided hyperparameter search tool, read this [doc](docs/nest.md).\n\n## Citation\nIf you find EGG useful in your research, please cite this repository:\n```\n@misc{kharitonov:etal:2021,\n  author = \"Kharitonov, Eugene  and Dess{\\`i}, Roberto and Chaabouni, Rahma  and Bouchacourt, Diane  and Baroni, Marco\",\n  title = \"{EGG}: a toolkit for research on {E}mergence of lan{G}uage in {G}ames\",\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/facebookresearch/EGG}},\n  year = {2021}\n}\n```\n\n## Contributing\nPlease read the contribution [guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n\n## Testing\nRun pytest:\n\n```\npython -m pytest\n```\n\nAll tests should pass.\n\n## Licence\nThe majority of EGG is licensed under MIT, however portions of the project are available under separate license terms: [LARC](egg/zoo/emcom_as_ssl/LARC.py) is licensed under the BSD 3-Clause license.\n\nThe text of the license for EGG can be found [here](LICENSE).\n"

We had plans for v3 yet but development isn't active. So v2 will probably remain the main stable version until further notice.\n\n> We try to publish **minor update releases** for bug fixes, we will review PRs.\n\n#### NPM\n\n```bash\n# Install npm version\n$ npm install whs\n```\n> For `whs@2.2.x` (Three.js r92) use @beta tag\n\n```bash\n# Install npm version\n$ npm install whs@beta\n```\n\n[![NPM Version][npm]][npm-url]\n\n\n### Basic setup\n\nDownload the [minified library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WhitestormJS/whs.js/dev/build/whs.min.js) or link the one from [CDN](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/whitestorm.js)\n\n```html\n<script src=\"js/three.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"js/whs.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nThe code below makes a `WHS.App` instance which handles all your [modules](modules) and components for better work with `WebGL`. This one creates a _scene_, _camera_ and _renderer_ - we add the following modules to the App.\n\n```js\nconst app = new WHS.App([\n  new WHS.ElementModule(), // Apply to DOM.\n  new WHS.SceneModule(), // Create a new THREE.Scene and set it to app.\n\n  new WHS.DefineModule('camera', new WHS.PerspectiveCamera({ // Apply a camera.\n    position: new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 50)\n  })),\n\n  new WHS.RenderingModule({bgColor: 0x162129}), // Apply THREE.WebGLRenderer\n  new WHS.ResizeModule() // Make it resizable.\n]);\n\napp.start(); // Run app.\n```\n\n<a

If you're interested in updating or maintaining Slackwolf, please send me a message! \n\nSlackwolf is a bot for Slack. After inviting the bot to a channel, you can play the timeless game of [Werewolf (also called Mafia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)).\n\n![ProjectImage](http://i.imgur.com/0Kwd8oe.png)\n\n## Roles\nSlackwolf currently supports Seer, Bodyguard, Witch, Lycan, Tanner, Beholder, Villager, Wolfman, and Werewolf. You'll need at least a 6 player game in order to see roles other than Seer/Villager/Werewolf given out.\n\n## How to play\n`/invite` the bot (and some friends) to a channel and type !help\n\n## Installation via Docker\nRun the below command to start a container.\n```\ndocker run -d --name slackwolf --restart always \\\n   -e \"BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-16776859568-RxBtmpeS7isMAQonAEqS1hYLb\" \\\n   -e \"TIMEZONE=America/Los_Angeles\" \\\n   -e \"BOT_NAME=werewolf-moderator\" \\\n   -e \"DEBUG=1\" \\\n   gillisct/slackwolf\n```\n\n## Development via Docker\nIn order to use a docker container for development of this project, first build\nthe container with the following command:\n```\ndocker build -t {namespace}/slackwolf .\n```\nSubstituting `namespace` for a relevant namespace you wish to refer the\ncontainer in, commonly your dockerhub username. Then modify following command\nwith your Slack Credentials and chosen namespace:  \n\n```\ndocker run -it --name slackwolf \\\n-e \"BOT_TOKEN=\" \\\n-e \"TIMEZONE=\" \\\n-e \"BOT_NAME=\" \\\n-e \"DEBUG=1\" \\\n{namespace}/slackwolf \\\n-v \"$(pwd)/src\":/usr/src/slackwolf/src \\\n/bin/bash\n```\nThis will provide you wish a shell inside the container, while still having the\nchanges made within the `src` directory reflected within the container\nenvironment.\n\nTo start the bot within the container type `php bot.php`\n\n## Source Installation\nIf you don't want to use docker, you can install from source.\n\nSlackwolf requires PHP 5.5+ and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).\n\n```\ngit clone http://github.com/chrisgillis/slackwolf\ncd slackwolf\ncomposer install\n```\n\nRename `.env.default` to `.env` and edit it with a valid real-time messaging bot token from Slack. Get a valid token from the \"Custom Integrations\" tab of your Slack \"Configure Apps\" page. Also be sure to put the correct bot name in the `.env` file as well.\n\nTo start the bot type `php bot.php`\n\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe're very accepting of pull requests. This is a fun project to get your feet wet with PHP or open source. If you're making a large change, create an Issue first and lets talk about it.\n\n## License\n\nMIT License.\n"

Install clang by typing \"clang\" in Terminal and clicking the Install button.\n2. Open a game folder and run run-mac.sh\n\n### Linux\n1. Install tcc, SDL2-dev, and GLEW-dev. Eg. for Debian/Ubuntu:\n\n    sudo apt install tcc libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libglew-dev\n\n2. Open a game folder and run run-linux.sh\n\n## Next?\n\nAfter you're done playing an exhilirating demo game, open the .c file in your favorite text editor. You're now looking at the actual code you just ran. So feel free to tinker and run it with your changes. Or use it as a starting point for your own game!\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Little Anti-Cheat\n\nLittle Anti-Cheat is a free and open source anti-cheat for source games, and runs on SourceMod.\\\nIt was originally developed for some secret servers I had back in the day.\\\nBut, as I quit cheating and quit having servers, I decided to release this project to help the community out.\\\nThis Anti-Cheat is by no means perfect, and it is bypassable to some extent, but it should still be helpful in dealing with cheaters :)\n\n### Current Cheat Detections:\n - Angle-Cheats (Legit Anti-Backstab (TF2), Basic Anti-Aims and Duckspeed).\n - Chat-Clear (When cheaters clear the chat).\n - Basic Invalid ConVar Detector (Checks if clients have sv_cheats turned on and such).\n - BunnyHop (Bhop).\n - Basic Projectile and Hitscan Aimbot.\n - Basic Aimlock.\n - Anti-Duck-Delay/FastDuck (CS:GO only).\n - Newlines in names.\n\n### Misc features:\n - Angle-Cheats Patch (Patches Angle-Cheats from working).\n - Max Interp Kicker (Kicks players for attempting to exploit interp (cl_interp 0.5)).\n - Max Ping Kicker (Kicks players for having too high ping (Disabled by default)).\n - Backtrack Patch (Patches backtrack cheats (Disabled by default)).\n - Macro detection.\n - Invalid name detection.\n - Invalid characters in chat patch (+ chat clear exploit fix).\n\n### Supported Games:\n - [TF2] Team Fortress 2\n - [CS:GO] Counter-Strike:Global Offensive\n - [CS:S] Counter-Strike:Source\n - [L4D2] Left 4 Dead 2\n - [L4D] Left 4 Dead\n - [DoD:S] Day of Defeat: Source\n\n### Untested, but should work in:\n - [HL2:DM] Half-Life 2:DeathMatch\n\n## Non-Steam versions / CS:S v34 / CS:S v91 / ETC...\nNon-Steam versions (IE: Cracks) **ARE NOT SUPPORTED!**\\\nI am sorry to say, but non-steam versions aren't supported.\\\nThis is because of technical problems with cracks, as they tend to be of older versions of the game, which means they'll have bugs that can conflict with some cheat detections.\\\nAnd I just don't want to support piracy.\\\nI also just don't want to download sketchy unofficial cracked versions of games...\n\nSo Little Anti-Cheat may not work out of the box for cracked versions of games.\\\nThat said, I've decided to be a little helpful based on feedback from others.\n\nFor Non-Steam/Cracked version of CS:S (like v34 or v91), Angle-Cheat detections won't work.\\\nYou can fix this by updating these ConVars: `lilac_angles 0` and `lilac_angles_patch 0`.\\\nThese **HAVE** to be disabled.\n\n### Credits / Special Thanks to:\n - J_Tanzanite... Yeah I'm crediting myself for writing this AC...\n - Azalty, for being (rightly) stubborn regarding an issue and for contributing database logging.\n - foon, for fixing sourcebans++ not working (https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=2689297#post2689297).\n - Bottiger, for fixing this plugin not working in CS:GO and general criticisms.\n - MAGNAT2645 for suggesting a cleaner method of handling convar changes.\n - Larry/LarryBrains for informing me of false Angle-Cheat detections in L4D2.\n - VintagePC (https://github.com/vintagepc) for SourceIRC support and basepath fix.\n\n### Current languages supported:\n - Simplified Chinese (by RoyZ https://github.com/RoyZ-CSGO ^-^).\n - Dutch (by snowy UwU OwO EwE).\n - Danish (by kS the Man / ksgoescoding c:).\n - Norwegian (by me, the translations could be better).\n - French (by Rasi / GreenGuyRasi).\n - English (by me lol duh hue hue hue).\n - Russian (by an awesome person c:).\n - Czech (by luk27official and someone else).\n - Brazilian Portuguese by SheepyChris (https://github.com/SheepyChris), Tiagoquix (https://github.com/Tiagoquix) and Crashzk (https://github.com/crashzk).\n - German (by two humble nice Germans c:).\n - Spanish (by ALEJANDRO ^-^).\n - Ukrainian (by panikajo ;D).\n - Polish (by https://github.com/qawery-just-sad).\n - Turkish (by ShiroNje and R3nzTheCodeGOD).\n - Hungarian (by The Solid Lad).\n - Swedish (by Teamkiller324).\\\n\\\nI do hope to add more languages in the future.\\\nBut at least you can add or improve on the translations already provided.\\\nMy friends who did some of the translations were told by me that the translations don't have to be perfect.\\\nJust understandable to those who don't speak English too well.\n\n### Optional:\n - Sourcebans++\n - MaterialAdmin\n - Updater\n\n\n## Donations / Sponsors / Support:\nIf you wish you support this project, I accept steam/game items: https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=883337522&token=D4Ku6oDJ\n\nAs of right now, that's the only platform I'll accept.\n"

Over the past year I accumulated a ton of saved links, and I've finally sorted through them all. \n\nThese are the games I find most interesting and/or have seen recommended most often. Some of them actually attempt to teach you a real programming language, and some are more about logical thinking. \n\nThis list doesn't contain programming challenge sites like HackerRank. Those are arguably very similar to puzzles, but for my purposes they're not \"gamey\" enough to include.\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Game</th>\n      <th>Browser</th>\n

As you traverse this evergrowing behemoth, you may be surprised to learn that many of the tools, libraries, frameworks, etc. featured herein are not made with hacking games in mind whatsoever. Since game hacking is a branch of reverse engineering in its own right, that means we have a wealth of other types of reverse engineering tools at our disposal which we can repurpose for game hacking.\n\nBeyond the tools, there is a wealth of knowledge to be gleaned from a cornucopia of tutorials, presentations, books, and much more. I'll constantly be updating this list, so be sure to Watch/Star it! If you'd like to share a resource that isn't yet on the list, feel free to submit it for consideration via creating an issue or pull request for this repository, or [email it to me](mailto:dsasmblr@gmail.com).\n\nFinally, if **hacking online games** is a topic of interest for you, I'm also maintaining an extensive curated repository for that subject alone: [The Ultimate Online Game Hacking Resource](https://github.com/dsasmblr/hacking-online-games). You may note a negligible amount of overlap between these two repositories, but by and large, they are complementary to one another. And now, on with the game-hacking goodness!\n# \n\n### Game Hacking Tools (Disassemblers, Debuggers, Hex Editors, Unpackers, and More)\n\nTool Type | Tool/Link | Description\n---- | ---- | ----\n**All-In-One** | [Cheat Engine](https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine) | [Open Source] *A powerful, all-in-one game hacking tool with an extensive feature set.

Please use hakchi2 CE (aka Hakchi 3) from https://github.com/TeamShinkansen/hakchi2/releases.**\n\n## hakchi2\n\nThis is a GUI for hakchi by madmonkey.\n\nThis application can add more games (game ROMs) to your NES/SNES Classic Mini or Famicom Mini. All you need is to connect it to a Windows PC via Micro-USB cable. No soldering or disassembling required.\n\nhttps://github.com/ClusterM/hakchi2\n\n### Features\n* Change any game settings (including command-line arguments)\n* Fill all game data automatically using included database\n* Automatically check for supported games\n* Search for box art using Google Images\n* Use [Game Genie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Genie) codes for NES games; includes Game Genie database\n* Automatically patch problem games (patches for many popular games included)\n* Upload hundreds of games at once\n* Return to the HOME menu with a button combination instead of the Reset button\n* Enable autofire A/B\n* Simulate the start button on the second controller (for Famicom Mini)\n* Disable seizure protection\n* Allows to install user-mods to add more features (even support for SNES/N64/Genesis/etc., music replacement, themes, etc.)\n\n## So you were the first to hack the NES Classic Mini?\nNo! It was my Russian \u0441omrade, madmonkey, who first published a successful hack of the the NES Classic Mini. He created the original \u201chakchi\u201d tool. However, it was not very user-friendly, so I decided to create a tool which is simple to use by anyone--not only Linux users. I named it \u201chakchi2\u201d because I don\u2019t like to come up with names. So my first version was a 2.0 release :)\n\n## How do I use the tool?\nBasically you just need to unpack it somewhere on your harddrive (installation is not required), run it, press \u201cAdd more games\u201d, select some game ROMs and press \u201cSynchronize\u201d. The application will guide you through this process.\n\n## How does the tool actually work?\nYou don\u2019t need to worry about it. But if you really want to know, it\u2019s using FEL mode. FEL is a low-level subroutine contained in the BootROM on Allwinner devices. It is used for initial programming and recovery of devices using USB. So we can upload some code into RAM and execute it. In this way we can read the Linux kernel (yes the NES Classic Mini and Famicom Mini runs an Linux operating-system), write kernel or execute kernel from memory without writing it to flash. So we can dump the kernel image of the NES Mini, unpack it, add some games and run a script which will copy them back to flash, repack, upload and execute. However, the games directory is on a read-only partition. Therefore we also need to create and flash a custom kernel with a special script that creates a sandbox folder on a writable partition and mounts it over the original games folder. This means that your original files are safe: you cannot delete or harm the original files in any way, even if you wanted. For kernel patching my application just executes other applications, which is why there is a \u201ctools\u201d folder.\n\n## What if I have another question?\nMany more commonly asked questions are answered in the FAQ:\nhttps://github.com/ClusterM/hakchi2/wiki/FAQ\n\n// Alexey 'Cluster' Avdyukhin (\"ClusterM\" on GitHub)\n"

The HTML5 renderer uses WebGL, with fallback to canvas.\nRendering in Flash uses Stage3D. Native Android and iOS apps are\npackaged using Adobe AIR.\n\nOn top of being high performance and cross-platform, Flambe recognizes\nthat assets and workflow are critical to game development. It includes\nbattle-tested support for importing Flash animations, bitmap fonts, and\nparticle systems. Live asset swapping lets you modify an asset and see\nthe change in your game automatically, *with no recompile or refresh*.\nWhen you need to make a code change, Flambe recompiles and automatically\nrefreshes your browser tab, all in under 2 seconds.\n\nCheck out the [Flambe wiki] for demos and more.\n\n## Installing\n\nSee the [install guide] on the wiki.\n\n## Hacking\n\nPatches and pull requests are welcome! To build and develop Flambe from\nsource, clone this repository and run:\n\n```\n(sudo) npm link ./command\nhaxelib dev flambe ./src\n```\n\nTo later go back to a stable release, run `(sudo) flambe update` and\n`haxelib dev flambe`.\n\nAre things not working?

If you are a sports betting aficionado and decide to test our suggestions with paper trading or real betting, please bear in mind that you are doing it under your own risk and responsibility. We do not claim any responsiblity for: A) the use that you might make of our code, B) the information contained in our online dashboard or C) any monetary losses you might incur during your betting experience.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

We provide the dashboard we used with the suggestions of our strategy. You can find a general non-mathematical short explanation of the strategy ([here](http://wp.me/p7wVWn-9Z))\n\nThe dashboard shows the games and odds that our strategy suggests as mispriced. We would definitely bet on these games if the bookies did not block our accounts. Other than that, we truly believe that the effort of deploying such a strategy is completely worthless, considering the time spent on the betting and the monetary reward.\n\n\nThis is how the dashboard looks like. It displays the upcoming games, odds, bookmaker and the remaining time to the onset of the game.\n\n\n![Alt text](/figures/dashboard.png?raw=true \"Dashboard with list of games\")\n\nYou can follow the upcoming games online at:\n\n```\nhttp://42.2.153.218:9090//\n```\n\n## How to run the code\n\nWe provide matlab/octave code to reproduce all the figures and analysis in the paper. \n\n1. Clone this repository\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/Lisandro79/BeatTheBookie.git\n\n```\n2. Download the dataset either from\n\nGoogle Drive ([link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3zgn2ueCERNWnJRSnpIQTBDWEU?usp=sharing))\n\nor\n\nDropbox\n\n* [closing odds](https://www.dropbox.com/s/g9vpjjlxjeruc3u/closing_odds.zip?dl=0)\n\n* [odds_series](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gqp3m6o5zsd8v63/odds_series.zip?dl=0)\n\n* [odds_series_b](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t26rwzvlwtt6xnb/odds_series_b.zip?dl=0)\n\n* [paper trading, real betting](https://www.dropbox.com/s/z4qi44s1dn4kuuv/paper_trading_real_betting_series.zip?dl=0)\n\n* [closing odds sql db](https://www.dropbox.com/s/adj7xivk40vuvl7/closing_odds_sql_db.zip?dl=0)\n\n* [odds series sql db](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sftxhxq03jd12j6/odds_series_sql_db.zip?dl=0)\n\n* [odds series b_sql db](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x6aookfjw25ne6q/odds_series_b_sql_db.zip?dl=0)\n\n\nNote: The sql database files are ~1.8GB of data. Due to space restrictions, the SQL databases are only available for download via Google Drive or Dropbox.\n\n\n3. Install mysql and import the database dumps:\n\n```\nmysql -u root -p < [file with first dump]\n```\n\n4. Install Matlab or\n\n5. Install Octave and the required Packages:\n\n```\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:octave/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install octave\nsudo apt-get install octave-control octave-image octave-io octave-optim octave-signal octave-statistics octave-nan\n```\n\nThe scripts were tested with Matlab, but they should work fine in Octave too with little adjustment.\n\n# Historical analysis of closing odds.\n\nThese analysis reproduce figures 1 and 2 from our paper. Place file \"closing_odds.cvs\" into \"/data\". Folder structure should look like this:\n\n```\ndata/\nfigures/\nsql/\nsrc/\n```\nThe first time the scripts are run, set \"runStrategy\" to 1, so that the script can generate the results of the strategy (after that \"runStrategy\" can be set to \"0\" to save some time). Then run:\n\n```\ncd src/\nFigure1.m\nFigure2A.m\n```\n\nThe rest of the code is self explanatory. \n\n\n## Historical analysis of odds series.\n\nThis analysis corresponds to Figure 2B and Figure 3 from the paper. Unzip files \"odds_series\" and \"paper_trading_real_betting_series\" in /data/. The folder scrutcure should look like this:\n\n```\n/data/odds_series/\n/data/odds_series_b/\n\n```\nThese two folders should contain several thousand files (one for each game).\n\nThen run these scripts:\n\n```\ncd src/\nFigure2B.m\nFigure3.m\n```\n\n## Dataset Description\n\nFor those interested in perfoming their own analysis with the dataset we provide two sql databases. Both are provided in the form of sql dumps exported from mysql databases:\n\n(1) **\"closing_odds.csv\"** and **\"closing_odds_sql_db\"**. Historical closing odds and match information for 880,494 football matches from 2000-01-01 to 2015-09-06 for 912 leagues around the world.  The csv file is a matrix of games (rows) x features (teams, scores, league, etc). See the matlab scripts for a description of the features\n\n(2) **\"odds_series\"** and **\"odds_series_sql_db\"**. Continuous odds series (series of odds with odds movements) and match information for 31,074 football matches from September 2015 until March 2016 for 553 leagues around the world. \n\n(3) **\"odds_series_b\"** and **\"odds_series_b_sql_db\"**. Continuous odds series (series of odds with odds movements) and match information for 82,786 football matches from March 2016 until November 2016 for 658 leagues around the world.\n\n**Database structure:**\n\n* Table \"matches\": contains information about the football matches\n\n| Field for table \"matches\"  | Column Description | \n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| ID  | auto increment id of table  |\n| league  | the league of the match (e.g. Spanish League)  |\n| team1   | local team  |\n| team2   | away team  |\n| result  | result of match   |\n| result_det  | detailed result of match (goals in first half, goals in second half, etc)  |\n| date |  datetime of the match |\n\n* Table \"odds_history\": for each match-bookmaker-outcome combination there is an entry in this table\n\n| Field for table \"odds_history\"  | Column Description | \n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| odds_history_id | id in odds_history table |\n| ID | id of match referring to matches table |\n| bookmaker | name of the bookie |\n| bettype | type of bet (e.g. 1x2) |\n| result | outcome for which the odd is offered |\n| disabled_date | date the odds on offer were disabled (could be null, i.e. they were still active until beginning of match), not available in historical odds database |\n\n* Table \"odds_history_series\": for each entry in table odds_history this table contains the odds series, i.e. one entry each time the odds are updated\n\n| Field for table \"odds_history_series\"  | Column Description | \n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| odds_history_series_id  | auto increment id |\n| odds_history_id | entry in odds_history table to which these odds are related |\n| odds_datetime | time at which these odds were offered |\n| odds | odds value |\n| opening_closing | specifies if the entry corresponds to closing odds. Value of 1 means closing odds, any other value means not a closing odds |\n| active | specifies if closing odds were active at closing time, only valid in historical odds database |\n\n* Within  *\"closing_odds_sql_db\"* we also provide a table containing the odds statistics calculated per match:\n\n| Field for table \"odds_stats_per_match_1x2_closing\" | Column Description | \n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| id  | auto increment id |  \n| match_table_id | id of matches table that corresponds to this row | \n| match_date | date of the match | \n| league | league of the match |  \n| teamA | home team | \n| scoreA | score of home team |  \n| teamB | away team | \n| scoreB | score of away team |  \n| avg_win_1 | average odds offered for home win | \n| avg_tie | average odds offered for a tie |  \n| avg_win_2 | average odds offered for away win | \n| max_win_1 | max odds offered for home win |  \n| max_tie | max odds offered for a tie | \n| max_win_2 | max odds offered for away win |  \n| top_bookie_win_1 | name of bookie offering the top odds for home win | \n| top_bookie_tie | name of bookie offering the top odds for a tie |  \n| top_bookie_win_2 | name of bookie offering the top odds for away win | \n| median_win_1 | median odds offered for home win |  \n| median_tie | median odds offered for a tie | \n| median_win_2 | median odds offered for away win |  \n| n_win_1 | number of active closing odds for home win | \n| n_tie | number of active closing odds for a tie |  \n| n_win_2 | number of active closing odds for away win | \n| result | result of the match |  \n| t_win_1 | time difference in seconds between the time the max odds were offered and the beginning of the match for home win  | \n| t_tie | time difference in seconds between the time the max odds were offered and the beginning of the match for a tie |  \n| t_win_2 | time difference in seconds between the time the max odds were offered and the beginning of the match for away win  | \n\nExample queries:\n\n* obtain closing odds for match with id 170088 (Belgium: Jupiler League, RAA Louvieroise vs Club Rugge, 2004-02-11) and result home win:\n\n```\nuse closing_odds;\nselect * from\nmatches m\ninner join\nodds_history oh\non m.ID = oh.ID\ninner join\nodds_history_series ohs\non oh.odds_history_id = ohs.odds_history_id\nwhere\nm.ID = 170088 and opening_closing = 1 and oh.result = 1;\n```\n\n* obtain odds series for match with id 879672, result home win and bookmaker 'youwin':\n\n```\nuse odds_series;\nselect * from\nmatches m\ninner join\nodds_history oh\non m.ID = oh.ID\ninner join\nodds_history_series ohs\non oh.odds_history_id = ohs.odds_history_id\nwhere\nm.ID = 879672 and oh.result = 1 and bookmaker = 'youwin';\n```\n\n\n## Generate csv files from the sql databases\n\nFor those interested in working with the dataset we provide php and sql scripts to generate the csv files used in the paper.\n\nTo generate the historical closing odds csv file (closing_odds.csv) from the database: \n\n```\n/src/generate_closing_odds_csv.php \n```\n\nTo generate the txt files with the odds time series:\n\n```\n/src/generate_odds_series_csv.php \n```\n\n"

Ask in `#bugs` / `#feedback` / `#questions` on the [Official Discord](https://discord.com/invite/HN7EVzV) if you are not entirely sure if it's a bug\n2. Check out the trello board: https://trello.com/b/ISQncpJP/shapezio\n3. See if it's already there - If so, vote for it, done. I will see it. (You have to be signed in on trello)\n4. If not, check if it's already reported here: https://github.com/tobspr/shapez.io/issues\n5. If not, file a new issue here: https://github.com/tobspr/shapez.io/issues/new\n6. I will then have a look (This can take days or weeks) and convert it to trello, and comment with the link. You can then vote there ;)\n\n## Building\n\n-   Make sure `ffmpeg` is on your path\n-   Install Node.js 16 and Yarn\n-   Install Java (required for texture packer)\n-   Run `yarn` in the root folder\n-   `cd` into `gulp` folder\n-   Run `yarn` and then `yarn gulp` - it should now open in your browser\n\n**Notice**: This will produce a debug build with several debugging flags enabled. If you want to disable them, modify [`src/js/core/config.js`](src/js/core/config.js).\n\n## Creating Mods\n\nMods can be found [here](https://shapez.mod.io). The documentation for creating mods can be found [here](mod_examples/), including a bunch of sample mods.\n\n## Build Online with one-click setup\n\nYou can use [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) (an Online Open Source VS Code-like IDE which is free for Open Source) for working on issues and making PRs to this project. With a single click it will start a workspace and automatically:\n\n-   clone the `shapez.io` repo.\n-   install all of the dependencies.\n-   start `gulp` in `gulp/` directory.\n\n[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/tobspr/shapez.io)\n\n## Helping translate\n\nPlease checkout the [Translations readme](translations/).\n\n## Contributing\n\nI will only accept pull requests which add a benefit to a large portion of the player base. If the feature is useful but only to a fraction of players, or is controversial, I recommend making a mod instead.\n\nIf you want to add a new feature or in generally contribute I recommend to get in touch on Discord in advance, which largely increases the chance of the PR to get merged:\n\n<a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/HN7EVzV\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/SoawBhW.png\" alt=\"discord logo\" width=\"100\">\n</a>\n\n### Code\n\nThe game is based on a custom engine which itself is based on the YORG.io 3 game engine (Actually it shares almost the same core).\nThe code within the engine is relatively clean with some code for the actual game on top being hacky.\n\nThis project is based on ES5 (If I would develop it again, I would definitely use TypeScript). Some ES2015 features are used but most of them are too slow, especially when polyfilled. For example, `Array.prototype.forEach` is only used within non-critical loops since its slower than a plain for loop.\n\n### Assets\n\nYou can find most assets <a href=\"//github.com/tobspr/shapez.io-artwork\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n\nAll assets will be automatically rebuilt into the atlas once changed (Thanks to dengr1065!)\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/W25Fkl0.png\" alt=\"shapez Screenshot\">\n\n<br>\n\n## Check out our other games!\n\n<a href=\"https://tobspr.io\" title=\"tobspr Games\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/uA2wcUy.png\" alt=\"tobspr Games\">\n</a>\n"

  "readme_contents": "# How to generate a new SDK?\nTo generate a new SDK you need to follow these steps.\n\n## 1. Choose the engine version your game uses\nTo make your life easier, you should copy the files from a game which uses the same version of UE as the new game because you need to make less code changes.\n\nShipped games to choose from are:\n\n\tUnreal Engine 1:\n\t\tUnreal\n\t\n\tUnreal Engine 2:\n\t\tUnreal 2\n\t\tUnreal Tournament 2004\n\t\n\tUnreal Engine 3:\n\t\tAll Points Bulletin: Reloaded\n\t\tHawken\n\t\tTribes: Ascends\n\t\tUnreal Tournament 3\n\t\n\tUnreal Engine 4:\n\t\tAlone in the Dark: Illumination\n\t\tARK Survival Evolved\n\t\tParagon\n\t\tUnreal Tournament 4\n\n## 2. Generate new project files\nIf you have choosen a game to copy from just run the _CreateNewProject.bat_ file. This will run a powershell script which will ask you for the name of the project to copy from and the name of the new project.\n\n**Example**:\nYou want to generate a SDK for a game called MyCoolGame. MyCoolGame uses the Unreal Engine 3 so you can then use Tribes: Ascends as template project. To create the new project files you execute the _CreateNewProject.bat_ file and enter \n\n\t> copy from: TribesAscend\n\t> new name: MyCoolGame\n\n(Hint: If the batch file is in the same folder as the other project files you can use TAB to autocomplete the names. Just remove the file extension in the name.)\n\nThe batch file copies the content, replaces some text and creates the new project files for you. You can do this manual too but why should you...? :smile:\n\nAs last step you need to open the _UnrealEngineSDKGenerator.sln_ and add the new _MyCoolGame.vcxproj_ to the solution.\n\n### List of generated files\nEach game has 5 files you may need to change.\n\n_EngineClasses.hpp_\nThis file contains the classes which are needed to generate the SDK. The classes are game dependend and usually you need to make changes here.\n\n_Generator.cpp_\nThis file contains settings which control the SDK generation. The classes are game dependen and usually you need to make changes here.\n\n_GenericTypes.cpp_\nThis file contains wrapper classes which map the classes from _EngineClasses.hpp_ to an interface which allows the generator to work with every version of Unreal Engine without making changes everywhere.\nNormaly you don't need to make changes here.\n\n_NamesStore.cpp_\nThis file contains the game dependend access to the names used by the game. Here you need to provide access to the global names array used by Unreal Engine. With the pattern library you can use signatures to automaticly find the correct adress at runtime.\n\n_ObjectsStore.cpp_\nSame as the _NamesStore.cpp_ but with code for the objects array used by Unreal Engine.  \n\n## 3. Reverse engineer the needed classes\nTo get the classes you need to insert into _EngineClasses.hpp_ I recommend this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNe4jz1v0R4 from The Feckless.\nIt shows how you can find the name array (put the signature in _NamesStore.cpp_), the object array (put the signature in _ObjectsStore.cpp_) and the needed classes (put them in _EngineClasses.hpp_).\nAgain: To make your life easier, you should use the same member names in the classes so you don't need to change other places too.\n\n## 4. Implement the project specific code\nThe _Generator.cpp_ file contains settings which control the SDK generation.\n\n### First the easy methods:\n\n`GetOutputDirectory()`\nThis method gets the path where the files should be generated. You don't need to add the game name because the name will get automaticly appended.\nIf you specify an absolute path (ex. \"C:/SDK_GEN\") the files will get generated there.\nIf you specify an relative path (ex. \"SDK_GEN\") the files will get generated in the directory where compiled dll is injected from appended with the relative path.\n**Example**:\nThe dll gets injected from \"C:/UnrealEngineSDKGenerator/bin/MyCoolGame.dll\". So the output directory will be \"C:/UnrealEngineSDKGenerator/bin/SDK_GEN\".\nThe default value is \"C:/SDK_GEN\".\n\n`GetGameName()`\nThis method should return the full name of the game. (ex. \"MyCoolGame\")\n\n`GetGameNameShort()`\nThis method should return an abbreviation for the full name. The generated files get prefixed with this short name. (ex. \"MCG\")\n\n`GetGameVersion()`\nThis method should return the current version of the game. The version number gets printed to the header of every file. (ex. \"1.2.3.4\")\n\n`ShouldDumpArrays()`\nIf this method returns true (default) the SDK dumper generates two textfiles which contain a list of all names and the names of the objects.\n\n`ShouldGenerateEmptyFiles()`\nIf this method returns false (default) no package files are generated when the package doesn't contain classes, constants or enums.\n\n`ShouldUseStrings()`\nIf this method returns true (default) the objects are referenced by their name. Otherwise the objects global index will be used.\nWarning: The index may change on updates or even on every start of the games.\n\n`ShouldXorStrings()`\nIf this method returns true (default: false) the strings printed by the generator get surrounded by `_xor_(...)`. With the XorStr library these strings get xor encrypted at compile time.\nhttps://svn.oldschoolhack.me/listing.php?repname=XorStr+%28...%2Fxorstr%29\n\n`ShouldConvertStaticMethods()`\nIf this method returns true (default) the static methods of a class are converted to normal methods. Static methods are only syntactic sugar from the engine. They are normal methods but called with the default object of a class. From the user point of view they are static methods but in reality they are not. If you want to use static methods you need to provide a method called `CreateDefaultObject()` in the UObject class. Some of the projects have signatures for the engine method but they could be hard to find. `ShouldConvertStaticMethods()` allows to rewrite the static methods to work like normal methods which require a class instance to get called. Additionaly these methods get a \"STATIC_\" prefix.\n\n`GetNamespaceName()`\nTo seperated the generated classes from the rest of your project you can surround the classes with a namespace. By default no namespace is generated.\nThis method should return the name of the namespace. If an empty name is given no namespace will be generated. (ex. \"Classes\")\nThe generated output looks like:\n\n```cpp\nnamespace Classes\n{\n\t...\n}\n```\n\n`GetIncludes()`\nIf your code needs some special header files to work return them in this method. For example you could need a pattern search library so add the related header file.\n**Example**:\n\n```cpp\nreturn {\n\tR\"(\"../my/relative/path/patternscan.hpp\")\", //with the raw literal you don't need to escape the quotes\n\t\"\\\"../math/vector.hpp\\\"\",\n\t\"<windows.h>\"\n};\n```\n\n`GetGlobalMemberAlignment()`\nThis method returns the alignment of members. By default this method returns 4 at 32bit and 8 at 64bit.\nSee https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2e70t5y1.aspx for more information.\n\n### The following methods are just getters and should not be modified:\n\n`GetOverrideType()`\nThis method checks if you have specified an override type for the related type. If no override type is found the original type is returned. This is usefull if you want to map some of your classes into the SDK. For example you could replace the provided `FVector` class with a version of your choice. You need to make sure the replacement hast the same size as the original class. If your override type is declared in an other header file you should add the include with the `GetIncludes()` method.\n\n`GetPredefinedClassMembers()`\nFor some classes the dumper can't generate members. If a class needs to have meaningfull members (for example the important `UObject` class) you can specify the members and this class will return them if the classname is matched.\n\n`GetPredefinedClassStaticMembers()`\nSometimes classes should have static members. This methods returns them if you have specified them.\n\n`GetVirtualFunctionPatterns()`\nIf you need virtual methods in a class you can specify patterns to match these methods. The generator loops the virtual methods of the class and checks for pattern matches. If a pattern matches the specific method will be added to the class.\n\n`GetPredefinedClassMethods()`\nIf you want to add methods to a class you can specify them and this method returns them.\n\n`GetClassAlignas()`\nSome classes need a special memory alignment (since Unreal Engine 4). This method gets the alignas value for the classes you have specified.\n\n### And now the advanced methods: :wink:\n\n`GetBasicDeclarations()`\nThis method returns a string with code which contains all the basic classes. Usually this is the same code you need to put in the _EngineClasses.hpp_. You should check the contained projects for examples.\n\n`GetBasicDefinitions()`\nThis method returns a string with code which contains definitions for the classes defined by the `GetBasicDeclarations()` method. You should check the contained projects for examples.\n\n`Initialize()`\nThis is the main method for you! This method initializes all the stuff the other methods need to work. You can do anything here (disable a possible protection, ...) but usually you just need to provide some data the getter methods can return.\nIt looks complicated but for the best explanation of this method you should have a look at the provided projects.\n\n*\t`overrideTypes`\n\tThis map contains the override classes used by `GetOverrideType()`.\n\n\t**Example**:\n\tThis example forces the generator to override both `FVector` classes with the custom classes.\n\t```cpp\n\toverrideTypes = {\n\t\t{ \"struct FVector\", \"class Vector3D\" },\n\t\t{ \"struct FVector2D\", \"class Vector2D\" }\n\t};\n\t```\n*\t`alignasClasses`\n\tThis map contains the alignas classes used by `GetClassAlignas()`.\n\n\t**Example**:\n\tThis example forces the alignas keyword for the three listed classes.\n\t```cpp\n\talignasClasses = {\n\t\t{ \"ScriptStruct CoreUObject.Plane\", 16 },\n\t\t{ \"ScriptStruct CoreUObject.Vector4\", 16 },\n\t\t{ \"ScriptStruct Engine.RootMotionSourceGroup\", 8 }\n\t};\n\t```\n\n*\t`virtualFunctionPattern`\n\tThis map is used by `GetVirtualFunctionPatterns()` and contains signatures which are used to find virtual methods in classes.\n\n\t**Example**:\n\tThis example adds a signature which if found adds the ProcessEvent method to the Object class.\n\t```cpp\n\tvirtualFunctionPattern[\"Class CoreUObject.Object\"] = {\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"\\x45\\x33\\xF6\\x4D\\x8B\\xE0\",\n\t\t\t\"xxxxxx\",\n\t\t\tR\"(inline void ProcessEvent(class UFunction* function, void* parms)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\treturn GetVFunction<void(*)(UObject*, class UFunction*, void*)>(this, %d)(this, function, parms);\n\t\t\t})\"\n\t\t}\n\t};\n\t```\n\n*\t`predefinedMembers`\n\tThis map is used by `GetPredefinedClassMembers()` and contains member variables which can't be dumped. At the moment you can't mix auto generated and predefined members.\n\tThe members are added in the class in the same order as in the map.\n\n\t**Example**:\n\tThis example adds the listed members to the Object class.\n\t```cpp\n\tpredefinedMembers[\"Class CoreUObject.Object\"] = {\n\t\t{ \"void*\", \"Vtable\" },\n\t\t{ \"int32_t\", \"ObjectFlags\" },\n\t\t{ \"int32_t\", \"InternalIndex\" },\n\t\t{ \"class UClass*\", \"Class\" },\n\t\t{ \"FName\", \"Name\" },\n\t\t{ \"class UObject*\", \"Outer\" }\n\t};\n\t```\n\n*\t`predefinedStaticMembers`\n\tThis map is used by `GetPredefinedClassStaticMembers()` and contains static member variables.\n\n\t**Example**:\n\tThis example adds the static member GObjects with the type FUObjectArray* to the Object class.\n\t```cpp\n\tpredefinedStaticMembers[\"Class CoreUObject.Object\"] = {\n\t\t{ \"FUObjectArray*\", \"GObjects\" }\n\t};\n\t```\n\n*\t`predefinedMethods`\n\tThis map is used by `GetPredefinedClassMethods()` and contains custom methods. This can be used to add helper functions like constructors.\n\n\t**Example**:\n\tThis example adds two constructors to the Vector2D class to make initialization easier.\n\t```cpp\n\tpredefinedMethods[\"ScriptStruct CoreUObject.Vector2D\"] = {\n\t\tPredefinedMethod::Inline(R\"(inline FVector2D() : X(0), Y(0) { })\"),\n\t\tPredefinedMethod::Inline(R\"(inline FVector2D(float x, float y) : X(x), Y(y) { })\")\n\t};\n\t```\n\n## And now?\nCompile the project and inject the DLL into the target. Use the debug build and a debugger to fix errors but use the release build to really generate the sdk. Otherwise you need to wait some minutes because the debug build is very slow. After you see the \"Finished!\" messagebox you can have a look at your new sdk.\n\nThe generated folder structure looks like this:\n```\nXXX\n+-- Generator.log\n+-- NamesDump.txt\n+-- ObjectsDump.txt\n+-- SDK.hpp\n+-- SDK\n|   +-- XXX_Basic.hpp\n|   +-- XXX_Basic.cpp\n|   +-- XXX_..._classes.hpp\n|   +-- XXX_..._functions.cpp\n|   +-- XXX_..._structs.hpp\n```\n\n_Generator.log_\nThis file contains the log messages the generator outputs.\n_NamesDump.txt_\nThis file is generated if `ShouldDumpArrays()` is true and it contains all names available in the names array.\n_ObjectsDump.txt_\nThis file is generated if `ShouldDumpArrays()` is true and it contains all objects names available in the objects array.\n_SDK.hpp_\nThis file contains all includes you need for the SDK.\n\n*XXX_Basic.hpp* / *XXX_Basic.cpp*\nThese files contain the code outputted by `GetBasicDeclarations()` and `GetBasicDefinitions()`.\n*XXX_..._classes.hpp* / *XXX_..._structs.hpp*\nThese files contain the code of the classes and structs.\n*XXX_..._functions.cpp*\nThis file contains the code of the class methods.\n\nThe SDK folder contains the generated code for every package. You need to copy the _SDK.hpp_ and the _SDK_ folder to your project. In your code you need an include to the _SDK.hpp_ and add the _*.cpp_ files to the project. Most of the time you don't need all the cpp files.\nFiles you may always need:\n```\nXXX_Basic.cpp\nXXX_Core(UObject)_functions.cpp\nXXX_Engine_functions.cpp\n```\nTo find these files just sort the SDK folder by file size. The biggest files are the files you are looking for.\n\nNow you can use the SDK in your project. Have fun. :smile:\n\n## Known Errors\nSometimes you can't compile the generated SDK. Here are some known errors and a solution how to fix them:\n\n- (UE4) In the generated enum EPixelFormat (CoreUObject_classes.hpp) is a PF_MAX value. The windows.h header defines a constant with the same name so this will keep you from compiling. Just remove the PF_MAX value from enum and all should work.\n- Sometimes class members or method parameters get a name like \"return\", \"continue\", \"break\" which are reserved keywords so the compiler will complain. To fix this error just rename these to something else.\n"

It supports multiple card environments with easy-to-use interfaces for implementing various reinforcement learning and searching algorithms. The goal of RLCard is to bridge reinforcement learning and imperfect information games. RLCard is developed by [DATA Lab](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/xiahu/) at Rice and Texas A&M University, and community contributors.\n\n*   Official Website: [https://www.rlcard.org](https://www.rlcard.org)\n*   Tutorial in Jupyter Notebook: [https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard-tutorial](https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard-tutorial)\n*   Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04376](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04376)\n*   GUI: [RLCard-Showdown](https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard-showdown)\n*   Dou Dizhu Demo: [Demo](https://douzero.org/)\n*   Resources: [Awesome-Game-AI](https://github.com/datamllab/awesome-game-ai)\n*   Related Project: [DouZero Project](https://github.com/kwai/DouZero)\n*   Zhihu: https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/526723604\n\n**Community:**\n*  **Slack**: Discuss in our [#rlcard-project](https://join.slack.com/t/rlcard/shared_invite/zt-rkvktsaq-xkMwz8BfKupCM6zGhO01xg) slack channel.\n*  **QQ Group**: Join our QQ group to discuss. Password: rlcardqqgroup\n\t*  Group 1: 665647450\n\t*  Group 2: 117349516\n\n**News:**\n*   We have updated the tutorials in Jupyter Notebook to help you walk through RLCard! Please check [RLCard Tutorial](https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard-tutorial).\n*   All the algorithms can suppport [PettingZoo](https://github.com/PettingZoo-Team/PettingZoo) now. Please check [here](examples/pettingzoo). Thanks the contribtuion from [Yifei Cheng](https://github.com/ycheng517).\n*   Please follow [DouZero](https://github.com/kwai/DouZero), a strong Dou Dizhu AI and the [ICML 2021 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06135). An online demo is available [here](https://douzero.org/). The algorithm is also integrated in RLCard. See [Training DMC on Dou Dizhu](docs/toy-examples.md#training-dmc-on-dou-dizhu).\n*   Our package is used in [PettingZoo](https://github.com/PettingZoo-Team/PettingZoo). Please check it out!\n*   We have released RLCard-Showdown, GUI demo for RLCard. Please check out [here](https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard-showdown)!\n*   Jupyter Notebook tutorial available! We add some examples in R to call Python interfaces of RLCard with reticulate. See [here](docs/toy-examples-r.md)\n*   Thanks for the contribution of [@Clarit7](https://github.com/Clarit7) for supporting different number of players in Blackjack. We call for contributions for gradually making the games more configurable. See [here](CONTRIBUTING.md#making-configurable-environments) for more details.\n*   Thanks for the contribution of [@Clarit7](https://github.com/Clarit7) for the Blackjack and Limit Hold'em human interface.\n*   Now RLCard supports environment local seeding and multiprocessing. Thanks for the testing scripts provided by [@weepingwillowben](https://github.com/weepingwillowben).\n*   Human interface of NoLimit Holdem available. The action space of NoLimit Holdem has been abstracted. Thanks for the contribution of [@AdrianP-](https://github.com/AdrianP-).\n*   New game Gin Rummy and human GUI available. Thanks for the contribution of [@billh0420](https://github.com/billh0420).\n*   PyTorch implementation available.

We recommend installing the stable version of `rlcard` with `pip`:\n\n```\npip3 install rlcard\n```\nThe default installation will only include the card environments. To use PyTorch implementation of the training algorithms, run\n```\npip3 install rlcard[torch]\n```\nIf you are in China and the above command is too slow, you can use the mirror provided by Tsinghua University:\n```\npip3 install rlcard -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple\n```\nAlternatively, you can clone the latest version with (if you are in China and Github is slow, you can use the mirror in [Gitee](https://gitee.com/daochenzha/rlcard)):\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard.git\n```\nor only clone one branch to make it faster:\n```\ngit clone -b master --single-branch --depth=1 https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard.git\n```\nThen install with\n```\ncd rlcard\npip3 install -e .\npip3 install -e .[torch]\n```\n\nWe also provide [**conda** installation method](https://anaconda.org/toubun/rlcard):\n\n```\nconda install -c toubun rlcard\n```\n\nConda installation only provides the card environments, you need to manually install Pytorch on your demands.\n\n## Examples\nA **short example** is as below.\n\n```python\nimport rlcard\nfrom rlcard.agents import RandomAgent\n\nenv = rlcard.make('blackjack')\nenv.set_agents([RandomAgent(num_actions=env.num_actions)])\n\nprint(env.num_actions) # 2\nprint(env.num_players) # 1\nprint(env.state_shape) # [[2]]\nprint(env.action_shape) # [None]\n\ntrajectories, payoffs = env.run()\n```\n\nRLCard can be flexibly connected to various algorithms.

You may optionally specify some configurations with a dictionary.\n*   **env = rlcard.make(env_id, config={})**: Make an environment. `env_id` is a string of a environment; `config` is a dictionary that specifies some environment configurations, which are as follows.\n\t*   `seed`: Default `None`. Set a environment local random seed for reproducing the results.\n\t*   `allow_step_back`: Default `False`. `True` if allowing `step_back` function to traverse backward in the tree.\n\t*   Game specific configurations: These fields start with `game_`. Currently, we only support `game_num_players` in Blackjack, .\n\nOnce the environemnt is made, we can access some information of the game.\n*   **env.num_actions**: The number of actions.\n*   **env.num_players**: The number of players.\n*   **env.state_shape**: The shape of the state space of the observations.\n*   **env.action_shape**: The shape of the action features (Dou Dizhu's action can encoded as features)\n\n### What is state in RLCard\nState is a Python dictionary. It consists of observation `state['obs']`, legal actions `state['legal_actions']`, raw observation `state['raw_obs']` and raw legal actions `state['raw_legal_actions']`.\n\n### Basic interfaces\nThe following interfaces provide a basic usage. It is easy to use but it has assumtions on the agent. The agent must follow [agent template](docs/developping-algorithms.md). \n*   **env.set_agents(agents)**: `agents` is a list of `Agent` object. The length of the list should be equal to the number of the players in the game.\n*   **env.run(is_training=False)**: Run a complete game and return trajectories and payoffs. The function can be used after the `set_agents` is called. If `is_training` is `True`, it will use `step` function in the agent to play the game. If `is_training` is `False`, `eval_step` will be called instead.\n\n### Advanced interfaces\nFor advanced usage, the following interfaces allow flexible operations on the game tree. These interfaces do not make any assumtions on the agent.\n*   **env.reset()**: Initialize a game. Return the state and the first player ID.\n*   **env.step(action, raw_action=False)**: Take one step in the environment. `action` can be raw action or integer; `raw_action` should be `True` if the action is raw action (string).\n*   **env.step_back()**: Available only when `allow_step_back` is `True`. Take one step backward. This can be used for algorithms that operate on the game tree, such as CFR (chance sampling).\n*   **env.is_over()**: Return `True` if the current game is over. Otherewise, return `False`.\n*   **env.get_player_id()**: Return the Player ID of the current player.\n*   **env.get_state(player_id)**: Return the state that corresponds to `player_id`.\n*   **env.get_payoffs()**: In the end of the game, return a list of payoffs for all the players.\n*   **env.get_perfect_information()**: (Currently only support some of the games) Obtain the perfect information at the current state.\n\n## Library Structure\nThe purposes of the main modules are listed as below:\n\n*   [/examples](examples): Examples of using RLCard.\n*   [/docs](docs): Documentation of RLCard.\n*   [/tests](tests): Testing scripts for RLCard.\n*   [/rlcard/agents](rlcard/agents): Reinforcement learning algorithms and human agents.\n*   [/rlcard/envs](rlcard/envs): Environment wrappers (state representation, action encoding etc.)\n*   [/rlcard/games](rlcard/games): Various game engines.\n*   [/rlcard/models](rlcard/models): Model zoo including pre-trained models and rule models.\n\n## More Documents\nFor more documentation, please refer to the [Documents](docs/README.md) for general introductions.

Similar to hiring someone to work with you, this allows you the opportunity to hire another gamer to game with you. It is all about gaming companionship.\n\nFrom the consumer perspective:\n\n1. You are a big fan of a professional gamer/famous streamer, and you want to play a game with with your beloved star., either as a sparring partner(opponent), or teammate.\n2. You are looking for someone to help you improve as a gamer, and want a gaming \"coach\" that can help you along in that process.\n3. You want to rank up in a specific game, but need help. You need a strong and capable teammate who has lots of experience with that game!\n4. You have a nice but less known multiplayer game, hire your fighter here!\n5. You're merely looking to hang out and socialize with streamers/gamers in a relaxed environment!\n\nFrom provider perspective:  \n\nWhile some gamers/streamers do make a lot of money, the large majority of gamers and/or streamers do not. This platform provides the opportunity for many gamers and streamers to expand their viewer base, reach new potential viewers and people to game with, and make new friends along the way! It also helps to link casual gamers up with more competitive and successful gamers/streamers, and in return helping everyone in the community grow. With this platform, we can create a new work force of gamers who are doing what they love, and making money along the way!\n\n## Application Features\n\nCore Features:\n\n1. Marketplace\n2. Payment\n3. Chat\n\nOptional Features:\n\n1. Gaming Contents\n2. Event Organizer\n\n## Getting Started  \n\nAndrei's [React Course](https://www.udemy.com/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/?couponCode=ZTMREACTLAUNCH) has almost all knowledge you need to get started.  \n\nPS: this is not advertising, this is coincidence, this project already existed for 3 months before the course was released.\n\n## Installation\n\nA step by step series of examples that tell you how to get the development env running.\n\nAfter git clone\n\nrequest the `.config` folder(s) from `tylim#9831` in `Discord`\n\n```bash\nnode install.js\n```\n\n## Development (Front End)\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n// run with dev env var, this may not work as dev is connect to dev server (experiment server)  \n\nnpm run prod\n// run with prod env var, recommended since this will work as experted most of the time\n```\n\nNow you can start hacking on front end!\n\n## Deployment (Front End)\n\n```bash\nnpm run d-deploy // deploy to dev server  \nnpm run p-deploy // deploy to prod server\nnpm run a-deploy // deploy to both dev and prod server\n```\n\nafter deployment, you can view it at\n\n1. [prod](https://gamesenshi.com/)\n2. [dev](https://game-senshi.firebaseapp.com/)\n\n## Deployment (Back End)\n\n\ud83d\uded1 Ignore this deployment section if you don't want to work with back end (firebase).\n\nDirect message `tylim#9831` in `Discord` your email to become user of this firebase project.\n\nIf you skip this step you have to setup your own firebase project.\n\n```bash\nnpm i && firebase login\n```\n\nabove command is one time setup, anytime you want to run deploy, in the `functions` folder, simply\n\n```bash\nnpm run d-deploy // deploy to dev server  \nnpm run p-deploy // deploy to prod server\nnpm run a-deploy // deploy to both dev and prod server\n```\n\nIt will automatically inject production environment variable, build and deploy front end or back end (make sure the command is run in /functions folder).\n\n## Built With\n\n- [Create-React-App](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) - React Project Generator\n- [Blk\u2022 Design System React(Bootstrap)](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/blk-design-system-react/) - CSS\n- [Styled Component](https://www.styled-components.com/) - CSS in JS\n- [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) - Components\n- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - Authentication, Storage, Database, Chat and Endpoint\n- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) - Payment\n\nPlease read [wiki](https://github.com/tylim88/GameSenshi/wiki) for details of our code, techs, guides and resources.\n\n## Contributing\n\nJoin our [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/tAyH3oig/a5374e9eaa1bbe644f3e7367d1e23300/game-senshi).\n\nJoin our Discord Channel\n![joinChannel.png](./src/0_assets/img/readme/joinChannel.png)\n\nPlease read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/tylim88/GameSenshi/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to contribute.\n\n## Not Sure Know What To Do?\n\n1. **Test** : Start with testing the code for any bugs, if found raise an issue about it.

Games can be compiled to iOS, Android and native apps by using 3rd party tools. You can use JavaScript or TypeScript for development.\n\nAlong with the fantastic open source community, Phaser is actively developed and maintained by [Photon Storm](http://www.photonstorm.com). As a result of rapid support, and a developer friendly API, Phaser is currently one of the [most starred](https://github.com/collections/javascript-game-engines) game frameworks on GitHub.\n\nThousands of developers from indie and multi-national digital agencies, and universities worldwide use Phaser. Take a look at their incredible [games](https://phaser.io/games/).\n\n**Visit:** The [Phaser website](https://phaser.io) and follow on [Phaser Twitter](https://twitter.com/phaser_)<br />\n**Play:** Some of the amazing games [#madewithphaser](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23madewithphaser&src=typed_query&f=live)<br />\n**Learn:** [API Docs](https://newdocs.phaser.io), [Support Forum][forum] and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/phaser-framework)<br />\n**Code:** 1770+ [Examples](https://phaser.io/examples) (source available in this [repo][examples])<br />\n**Read:** The [Phaser World](#newsletter) Newsletter<br />\n**Discord:** Join us on [Discord](https://phaser.io/community/discord)<br />\n**Extend:** With [Phaser Plugins](https://phaser.io/shop/plugins)<br />\n**Be awesome:** [Support](#support) the future of Phaser<br />\n\nGrab the source and join the fun!\n\n![What's New](https://phaser.io/images/github/div-whats-new.png \"What's New\")\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://phaser.io/images/github/news.jpg\"></div>\n\n> 7th June 2022\n\nWe've been quietly but solidly working away on Phaser 3.60 for months now and are very close to release. Today I'm happy to say that 3.60 Beta 9 has been published and I would urge you to test it, if you can do so. It should be a safe drop-in replacement for Phaser 3.55, with very little need for changes to your code. However, it does bring a lot of new features and fixes to the table.\n\nSome of the new features include:\n\n**Sprite FX** - The ability to create and use SpriteFX Pipelines directly on Sprite Game Objects. These allow a really easy way to define per-Sprite shaders, including extra padding space, perfect for effects such as blur, distort, glow, outline, shadow and more.\n\n**Compressed Texture Support** - Phaser 3.60 contains support for Compressed Textures. It can parse both KTX and PVR containers and within those has support for the following formats: ETC, ETC1, ATC, ASTC, BPTC, RGTC, PVRTC, S3TC and S3TCSRB. Compressed Textures differ from normal textures in that their structure is optimized for fast GPU data reads and lower memory consumption. Popular tools that can create compressed textures include PVRTexTool, ASTC Encoder and Texture Packer.\n\n**Matter Physics v0.18** - We have updated the version of Matter Physics to the latest v0.18 release. This is a big jump and brings with it quite a few internal changes to Matter, as well as a ~40% performance improvement.\n\nThere are also hundreds of updates and bug fixes across the entire codebase.\n\nAs always, I have been careful to record all of these in their own [Change Log](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/CHANGELOG-v3.60.md). So it's easier for you to identify which change happened in the 3.60 version specifically.\n\nBeta 9 is available now from the [Releases page](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/releases). You can also download it from npm:\n\n```\nnpm i phaser@3.60.0-beta.9\n```\n\nI have published new TypeScript defs files that align with this version. You can find them in the `types` folder of this repository.\n\n> If you find any problems with this release I'd urge you to please report them in GitHub issues.\n\nAs usual, I'd like to send my thanks to the Phaser community for their help in both reporting issues and submitting pull requests to fix them. So, please do spend some time digging through the [Change Log](#changelog). I assure you, it's worth while :)\n\nI'd like to send a massive thank-you to everyone who supports [Phaser on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photonstorm), GitHub Sponsors and our corporate backers. Your continued funding allows me to keep working on Phaser full-time and this monster of a new release is the very real result of that. If you've ever considered becoming a backer, now is the perfect time!\n\nIf you'd like to stay abreast of developments then I'm now publishing them to the [Phaser Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photonstorm). Here you can find the latest development reports including the concepts behind Phaser 4.\n\nYou can also follow Phaser on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/phaser_) and chat with fellow Phaser devs in our [Discord](https://phaser.io/community/discord).\n\nPhaser 3 wouldn't have been possible without the fantastic support of the community and Patreon. Thank you to everyone who supports our work, who shares our belief in the future of HTML5 gaming, and Phaser's role in that.\n\nHappy coding everyone!\n\nCheers,\n\nRich - [@photonstorm](https://twitter.com/photonstorm)\n\n![boogie](https://www.phaser.io/images/spacedancer.gif)\n\n![Support Phaser](https://phaser.io/images/github/div-support-phaser.png \"Support Phaser\")\n\nBecause Phaser is an open source project, we cannot charge for it in the same way as traditional retail software. What's more, we don't ever want to. After all, it's built on, and was born from, open web standards. It's part of our manifesto that the core framework will always be free, even if you use it commercially, as many of you do.\n\n**You may not realize it, but because of this, we rely 100% on community backing to fund development.**\n\nThose funds allow Phaser to improve, and when it improves, everyone involved benefits. Your support helps secure a constant cycle of updates, fixes, new features and planning for the future.\n\nWe use [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photonstorm) to manage the backing and you can [support Phaser](https://www.patreon.com/join/photonstorm?) from $1 per month. The amount you pledge is entirely up to you and can be changed as often as you like. Patreon renews monthly, just like Netflix. You can, of course, cancel at any point. Tears will be shed on this end, but that's not your concern.\n\nYou can also support us by using crypto currencies. The Phaser wallet addresses are:\n\n* Ethereum: 0x6a716A122Ad186ECE865C55D16c1D361f1B13724\n* BSC / AVAX / Polygon: 0x94aC3F640b8749AbD1d44f29A62ffeB32CA34628\n\nExtra special thanks to the following companies whose support makes Phaser possible:\n\n* [Cerebral Fix](https://cerebralfix.com)\n* [MoPub](https://www.mopub.com/en)\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com)\n* [Game Distribution](https://gamedistribution.com)\n* [GameCommerce](https://www.gamecommerce.com)\n* [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org)\n* [Texture Packer](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker/tutorials/how-to-create-sprite-sheets-for-phaser3?utm_source=ad&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=phaser-2018-10-16)\n* [TwilioQuest](https://www.twilio.com/blog/unlock-your-power-to-teach-with-twilioquest?utm_source=github&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=phaser)\n* [Poki](https://developers.poki.com/)\n* [CrazyGames](https://www.crazygames.com)\n* [Lagged](https://www.lagged.com)\n* [Nakama](https://heroiclabs.com/phaserjs/)\n\n![Sponsors](https://phaser.io/images/github/sponsors-2021-08.png \"Our Awesome Sponsors\")\n\n![Download Phaser](https://phaser.io/images/github/div-download.png \"Download Phaser\")\n<a name=\"download\"></a>\n\nPhaser 3 is available via GitHub, npm and CDNs:\n\n* Clone the git repository via [https][clone-http], [ssh][clone-ssh] or with the GitHub [Windows][clone-ghwin] or [Mac][clone-ghmac] clients.\n* Download as [zip](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/archive/master.zip)\n* Download the build files: [phaser.js][get-js] and [phaser.min.js][get-minjs]\n\n### NPM\n\nInstall via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):\n\n```bash\nnpm install phaser\n```\n\n### CDN\n\n[![](https://data.jsdelivr.com/v1/package/npm/phaser/badge)](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/phaser)\n\n[Phaser is on jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/phaser) which is a \"super-fast CDN for developers\". Include the following in your html:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3.55.2/dist/phaser.js\"></script>\n```\n\nor the minified version:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3.55.2/dist/phaser.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n### API Documentation\n\nGo to https://newdocs.phaser.io/ to read the docs online using our brand new interface. Use the links to navigate the namespaces, classes and Game Objects lists and also use the new search box.\n\nThe documentation for Phaser 3 is an on-going project. Please help us by contributing improved docs and examples.\n\n### TypeScript Definitions\n\nThe [TypeScript definitions](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/master/types) can be found inside the `types` folder. They are also referenced in the types entry in `package.json`.\n\nDepending on your project, you may need to add the following to your `tsconfig.json` file:\n\n```json\n\"typeRoots\": [\n    \"./node_modules/phaser/types\"\n],\n\"types\": [\n    \"Phaser\"\n]\n```\n\nWe recently published a new [Phaser 3 TypeScript Project Template](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-typescript-project-template), which you can use to get started with if you like.\n\nThe TS defs are automatically generated from the JSDoc comments found in the Phaser source code. If you wish to help refine them then you must edit the Phaser JSDoc blocks directly, not the defs file. You can find more details about the parser we built in the `scripts/tsgen` folder.\n\n### Webpack\n\nWe use Webpack to build Phaser and we take advantage of its conditional build flag feature to handle renderer swapping. If you wish to use Webpack with Phaser then please use our [Phaser 3 Project Template](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-project-template) as it's already set-up to handle the build conditions Phaser needs. Recent changes to our build steps mean you should now be able to use any other packager, like Parcel, without any config changes.\n\n### License\n\nPhaser is released under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\n![Getting Started](https://phaser.io/images/github/div-getting-started.png \"Getting Started\")\n<a name=\"getting-started\"></a>\n\n<img src=\"https://phaser.io/images/github/learn.jpg\" align=\"right\">\n\nTutorials and guides on Phaser 3 development are being published every week.\n\n* [Getting Started with Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3) (useful if you are completely new to Phaser)\n* [Making your first Phaser 3 Game](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game)\n* The [Complete Phaser 3 Game Development course](https://academy.zenva.com/product/html5-game-phaser-mini-degree/?a=13) contains over 15 hours of videos covering all kinds of important topics.\n* Plus, there are [over 700 Phaser tutorials](https://phaser.io/learn) listed on the official website.\n\nWe've 3 tutorials related specifically to creating **Facebook Instant Games** with Phaser:\n\n* [Getting Started with Facebook Instant Games](https://phaser.io/news/2018/10/facebook-instant-games-phaser-tutorial)\n* [Facebook Instant Games Leaderboards Tutorial](https://phaser.io/news/2018/11/facebook-instant-games-leaderboards-tutorial)\n* [Displaying Ads in your Instant Games](https://phaser.io/news/2018/12/facebook-instant-games-ads-tutorial)\n\n### Source Code Examples\n\nDuring our development of Phaser 3, we created hundreds of examples with the full source code and assets ready available. These examples are now fully integrated into the [Phaser website](https://phaser.io/examples). You can also browse them on [Phaser 3 Labs](https://labs.phaser.io) via a more advanced interface, or clone the [examples repo][examples]. We are constantly adding to and refining these examples.\n\n### Hathora\n\nHathora is a framework for creating online multiplayer games with a focus on providing the best developer experience possible. The framework handles aspects such as State Synchronization, persistence, and authentication so that you can focus on building your game. Once you\u2019ve built your game, you can deploy it to Hathora Cloud with a single command, and it will push your game to servers all over the world, automatically scaling up or down based on the user load. Visit the [Hathora documentation](https://docs.hathora.dev/#/) to learn more.\n\n### Huge list of Phaser 3 Plugins\n\nSuper community member RexRainbow has been publishing Phaser 3 content for years, building up an impressive catalogue in that time. You'll find [loads of plugins](https://rexrainbow.github.io/phaser3-rex-notes/docs/site/index.html#list-of-my-plugins), from UI controls such as text input boxes, to Firebase support, Finite State Machines and lots more. As well as the plugins there is also a comprehensive set of 'Notes' about Phaser 3, going into great detail about how the various systems work. It's an invaluable resource and well worth checking out at [https://rexrainbow.github.io](https://rexrainbow.github.io/phaser3-rex-notes/docs/site/index.html)\n\n### Create Your First Phaser 3 Example\n\nCreate an `index.html` page locally and paste the following code into it:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3.55.2/dist/phaser-arcade-physics.min.js\"></script> \n</head>\n<body>\n\n    <script></script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis is a standard empty webpage. You'll notice there's a script tag that is pulling in a build of Phaser 3, but otherwise this webpage doesn't do anything yet. Now let's set-up the game config. Paste the following between the `<script></script>` tags:\n\n```javascript\nvar config = {\n    type: Phaser.AUTO,\n    width: 800,\n    height: 600,\n    physics: {\n        default: 'arcade',\n        arcade: {\n            gravity: { y: 200 }\n        }\n    },\n    scene: {\n        preload: preload,\n        create: create\n    }\n};\n```\n\n`config` is a pretty standard Phaser 3 Game Configuration object. We tell `config` to use the WebGL renderer if it can, set the canvas to a size of 800x600 pixels, enable Arcade Physics, and finally call the `preload` and `create` functions. `preload` and `create` have not been implemented yet, so if you run this JavaScript code, you will have an error. Add the following after `config`:\n\n```javascript\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(config);\n\nfunction preload ()\n{\n    this.load.setBaseURL('https://labs.phaser.io');\n\n    this.load.image('sky', 'assets/skies/space3.png');\n    this.load.image('logo', 'assets/sprites/phaser3-logo.png');\n    this.load.image('red', 'assets/particles/red.png');\n}\n\nfunction create ()\n{\n}\n```\n\n`game` is a Phaser Game instance that uses our configuration object `config`. We also add function definitions for `preload` and `create`. The `preload` function helps you easily load assets into your game. In `preload`, we set the Base URL to be the Phaser server and load 3 PNG files.\n\nThe `create` function is empty, so it's time to fill it in:\n\n```javascript\nfunction create ()\n{\n    this.add.image(400, 300, 'sky');\n\n    var particles = this.add.particles('red');\n\n    var emitter = particles.createEmitter({\n        speed: 100,\n        scale: { start: 1, end: 0 },\n        blendMode: 'ADD'\n    });\n\n    var logo = this.physics.add.image(400, 100, 'logo');\n\n    logo.setVelocity(100, 200);\n    logo.setBounce(1, 1);\n    logo.setCollideWorldBounds(true);\n\n    emitter.startFollow(logo);\n}\n```\n\nHere we add a sky image into the game and create a Particle Emitter. The `scale` value means that the particles will initially be large and will shrink to nothing as their lifespan progresses.\n\nAfter creating the `emitter`, we add a logo image called `logo`. Since `logo` is a Physics Image, `logo` is given a physics body by default. We set some properties for `logo`: velocity, bounce (or restitution), and collision with the world bounds. These properties will make our logo bounce around the screen. Finally, we tell the particle emitter to follow the logo - so as the logo moves, the particles will flow from it.\n\nRun it in your browser and you'll see the following:\n\n![Phaser 3 Demo](https://phaser.io/images/github/300/sample1.png \"Phaser 3 Demo\")\n\n(Got an error? Here's the [full code](https://gist.github.com/photonstorm/46cb8fb4b19fc7717dcad514cdcec064))\n\nThis is a tiny example, and there are hundreds more for you to explore, but hopefully it shows how expressive and quick Phaser is to use. With just a few easily readable lines of code, we've got something pretty impressive up on screen!\n\n[![Ourcade](https://phaser.io/images/github/ourcade.jpg)](https://blog.ourcade.co)\n\nOurcade have published [two great Phaser 3 books](https://blog.ourcade.co). They'll take you from getting set-up, through to finishing your first game using modern JavaScript or TypeScript and they're both completely free! They also publish a huge range of quality tutorials and videos, so be sure to check out their site every week.\n\n[![HTML5 Cross Platform Game Development with Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/images/github/feronato.png)](https://gumroad.com/a/244184179)\n\nLearn the secrets of HTML5 game development with Phaser 3.50 while building a cross platform endless runner game. Designed both for beginners and skilled programmers, the course guides you from an empty folder introducing the bare bones of JavaScript to advanced Phaser 3 features. Find out more details about [HTML5 Cross Platform Game Development with Phaser](https://gumroad.com/a/244184179).\n\n![Building Phaser](https://phaser.io/images/github/div-building-phaser.png \"Building Phaser\")\n\nThere are both plain and minified compiled versions of Phaser in the `dist` folder of the repository. The plain version is for use during development, and the minified version is for production use. You can and should also create your own builds.\n\n### Custom Builds\n\nPhaser 3 is built using Webpack and we take advantage of the Webpack definePlugin feature to allow for conditional building of the Canvas and WebGL renderers and extra plugins. You can custom the build process to only include the features you require. Doing so can cut the main build file size down to just 70KB.\n\nRead our [comprehensive guide](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-custom-build#creating-custom-phaser-3-builds) on creating Custom Builds of Phaser 3 for full details.\n\n### Building from Source\n\nIf you wish to build Phaser 3 from source, ensure you have the required packages by cloning the repository and then running `npm install` on your source directory.\n\nYou can then run `webpack` to create a development build in the `build` folder which includes source maps for local testing. You can also `npm run dist` to create a minified packaged build in the `dist` folder. For a list of all commands available use `npm run help`.\n\n![Change Log](https://phaser.io/images/github/div-change-log.png \"Change Log\")\n<a name=\"changelog\"></a>\n\n# Change Log\n\nDue to the increasing size of our Change Logs we have now split them up into four parts:\n\n* [v3.60.0 Change Log](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/CHANGELOG-v3.60.md) (the 3.60 specific change log, still in Beta)\n* [v3.50.1+ Change Log](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) (this is the most recent Change Log, for 3.55+)\n* [v3.50.0 Change Log](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/CHANGELOG-v3.50.md) (all the changes 3.50 contained)\n* [v3.0.0 to v3.24.1. Change Log](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/CHANGELOG-v3.00-v3.24.1.md) (everything that came before)\n\nWe've organized the Change Logs into commonly themed sections to make it more digestible, but we appreciate there is a lot in there. Please don't feel overwhelmed! If you need clarification about something, join us on the Phaser Discord and feel free to ask.\n\n![Contributing](https://phaser.io/images/github/div-contributing.png \"Contributing\")\n<a name=\"contributing\"></a>\n\nThe [Contributors Guide][contribute] contains full details on how to help with Phaser development.

banks: instead of having only 1 memory bank you have 8.\n- Export your game without editors, and then publish it to app stores.\n\n# Community\nYou can play and share games, tools and music at [https://tic80.com/play](https://tic80.com/play).\n\nThe community also hangs out and discusses on [Telegram](https://t.me/tic80) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/HwZDw7n4dN).\n\n# Contributing\nYou

If this happens and the Z-coordinate is set to a negative number, you won't see it when the Scene plays. To fix this, change the Z-coordinate to be 0 on the GameObject Transform.\n\n## Errata\n\n#### Chapter 3, Page 53\nCredit: [@omundy](https://github.com/omundy)\n\nAfter stopping the playing scene, add the animation for the player's idle state. From the Sprites folder, select the last *two* sprites from the Player32x32 sprite-sheet, titled: `Player32x32_12` and `Player32x32_13` and drag them onto the PlayerObject. When prompted by the Create New Animation save window, name the created animation-clip, \"player-idle\" and save to the Animations -> Animations folder.\n\n#### Chapter 4\nCredit: [@josenerydev](https://github.com/josenerydev)\n\nIssue with format of file: `OutdoorObjects.png`. (fixed in GitHub repo)\n\n#### Chapter 4, Page 93\n\nIn the **Creating Tile Palettes** section, the `Tile Palette` window in Unity 2018.3 is now located under `Window -> 2D -> Tile Palette`.\n\n#### Chapter 4, Page 128\nCredit: [@omundy](https://github.com/omundy)\n\nMake sure to attach the `RoundCameraPos` script to the virtual camera object. Drag and drop the `RoundCameraPos` onto \"CM vcam1\".\n\n#### Chapter 4, Page 137\nCredit: [@omundy](https://github.com/omundy)\n\nThe interface has been updated in Unity 2018.3. The menu item \"Edit Physics Shape\" has been renamed to \"Custom Physics Shape\". After selecting Custom Physics Shape, click the \"Generate\" button on the right before editing.\n\n#### Chapter 5, Page 147 \nCredit: [@omundy](https://github.com/omundy) \n\nCreate the GameObject in the hierarchy view (not project view). \n\n#### Chapter 5, Page 161\nCredit: [@mprogers](https://github.com/mprogers) \n\nIn the **Build the Consumable Script** section, third paragraph, note that there is a distinction between the behavior of Scriptable Objects when running a project in the Editor, versus when running in a deployed (to device) build: Scriptable Objects cannot be used to _save_ changes to data in a deployed build. More on this subject can be read [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-ScriptableObject.html).\n\n#### Chapter 5, Page 162\nCredit: [@omundy](https://github.com/omundy) \n\nIn the **Assembling Our Item** section, third paragraph, rename the Scriptable Object, \"Coin\" (not \"Item\"). \n\n#### Chapter 5, Page 164\nCredit: [@omundy](https://github.com/omundy) \n\nIn the **Player Collisions** section, the first line of code section `// 3`, should be:\n\n```\nprint(\"Hit: \" + hitObject.objectName);\n```\n\n#### Chapter 5, Page 166\nCredit: [@omundy](https://github.com/omundy)\n\nSteps 10 and 11 are duplicates of step 3 and can be disregarded.\n\n#### Chapter 6, Page 198\nCredit: [@omundy](https://github.com/omundy)\n\nUnder the heading **Create the HealthBar Script**, right-click in the MonoBehaviours folder **and create a new C# script** called HealthBar.\"\n\n#### Chapter 6, Page 202-204\nCredit: [@omundy](https://github.com/omundy)\n\nEnsure a copy of the `HealthBarObject` is in the Hierarchy view and select it. Add the HealthBar script this HealthBarObject. When working with the HealthBar in these next 3 pages (202-204), work with the copy of `HealthBarObject` in the Hierarchy view, not the copy in the Prefab folder. Make sure to apply changes when you're done, so the changes propagate to the Prefab.\n\n**Note**: The location of the button to apply changes to a prefab has changed in Unity 2018. The button is now located in the top right of the Inspector, in a drop-down menu called Overrides.\n\n#### Chapter 6, Page 204\nCredit: [@omundy](https://github.com/omundy)\n\nThe property, `Character Category` which appears in the source and in Figure 6-22 may be disregarded, or used later on in your game to broadly distinguish between what is/isn't an enemy, or the player (or even an NPC) instead of creating a tag for each character type.\n\n#### Chapter 6, Page 207\nCredit: [@omundy](https://github.com/omundy)\n\nWith `InventoryObject` selected, in the Canvas Scaler component, set `Reference Pixels Per Unit` to 32.\n\n\n#### Chapter 7, Page 263\nCredit: [@omundy](https://github.com/omundy)\n\nIn the **The DamageCharacter() method** section, the code should be added to the `Enemy` class.\n\n\n#### Chapter 7, Page 269\nCredit: [@omundy](https://github.com/omundy)\n\nIn the **Refactoring Prefab Instantiation** section, remove all *four* lines from `Start()` and add them to the new `ResetCharacter()` override.\n\nAfter you add the `ResetCharacter()` method to the `Player` class, add the following method\n\n```\nprivate void OnEnable() {\n\tResetCharacter();\n}\n```\n\n#### Chapter 7, Page 275\nCredit: [@omundy](https://github.com/omundy)\n\nYou'll notice when you run into the enemies they spin. Like you did with the PlayerObject, check `Freeze Rotation` for the Z axis inside the Rigidbody2D on the EnemyObject prefab.\n\n\n\n#### Chapter 8, Page 287\nCredit: [@omundy](https://github.com/omundy)\n\nIn the **Enemy Walk Animation** section, select the Enemy prefab then open the **Animator** window as seen in Figure 8-3.\n\n\n\n#### Chapter 8, Page 357\nCredit: [@VADS](https://github.com/VADS)\n\nIn the implementation of the `GetQuadrant()` method, disregard the first two variable declarations: `Vector2 mousePosition = Input.mousePosition;` and `Vector2 playerPosition = transform.position;` as they are not used.\n\n#### Chapter 8, Page 360\nCredit: [@rdimitriev](https://github.com/rdimitriev)\n\nIn the method `UpdateState()`, the case for `Quadrant.West:` should be changed from: `quadrantVector = new Vector2(-1.0f, 1.0f);` to `quadrantVector = new Vector2(-1.0f, 0.0f);`\n\n\n\n"

  "readme_contents": "<img src=\"repo/splash.png\" alt=\"Amethyst 2D starter template\" />\n\nThis project template will get you from 0 to drawing something on the screen in no time. If you're looking for a more in-depth introduction to the engine, please have a look at [our book](https://book.amethyst.rs/stable/)!\n\nThis project template also includes a small example of how to draw UI, see in state.rs for create_ui_example().\n<img src=\"repo/screenshot.png\" alt=\"Amethyst 2D starter template\" height=\"300px\" />\n\n## Quickstart\n\n- Clone the repository\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst-starter-2d.git\ncd amethyst-starter-2d\n```\n\n- Build and run the project\n\n```bash\ncargo run\n```\n\n#### For Mac Users\n\nThis starter uses vulkan as a renderer by default. You'll want to change the backend to use `metal`, which can be done by opening the `Cargo.toml` file and changing\n\n```toml\n[features]\ndefault = [\"vulkan\"]\n```\n\nto\n\n```toml\n[features]\ndefault = [\"metal\"]\n```\n\nIf using OSX and Metal you will require full XCode installed from the Appstore in order to compile metal shaders.\nAfter install you may be required to run this command `sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` [reference gfx-rs issue](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx/issues/2472)\n\n#### For Linux Users\n\nYou might need to install some dependencies. Please refer to [this section](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst#dependencies) of the README for more details.\n\n## Features\n\nThis project contains the minimum amount of code needed to draw sprites to the screen. Here's a small summary of what you'll find in the source files:\n\n- `resources/display_config.ron`  \n  Contains the window configuration (size, title).\n\n- `src/main.rs`  \n  Creates the render graph, adds the required bundles, builds the game data with our own state and finally, starts the game's main event loop.\n\n- `src/state.rs`  \n  Implements the main game state. In the `on_start` hook, the camera is initialized, and the sprites that will be drawn are loaded and their entities created.  \n   In the `handle_event` hook, we print any keys that were pressed and close the window if the user presses escape or the OS requests that we quit.\n"

However, we cannot guarantee that issues will be resolved.\n\nBefore creating an issue, please do the following:\n\n- Check the [Developer Documentation](https://developer.riotgames.com/) to make sure the behavior you are reporting is really a bug, not a feature.\n- Check the [existing issues](https://github.com/RiotGames/developer-relations/issues) to make sure you are not duplicating somebody&#39;s work.\n- Verify that the issue you are about to report relates to the Riot Games Developer Ecosystem and is not a game bug (for game bugs please go [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us)).\n\nIf you&#39;re sure that the problem you&#39;re experiencing is caused by a bug, follow the recommendations below to file a new issue in a Github issue tracker.\n\n**Issue Template**\n\nPlease follow this section carefully, as it ensures we gather accurate information about any issues.\n\nNote that higher levels of detail in the report increases the chance that someone will be able to reproduce the issue.\n\n**Issue Format:**\n\n        Preconditions\n\n1.\n2.\n\n        Steps to Reproduce\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n\n        Expected Result\n\n1. [Screenshots, logs or description]\n\n        Actual Result\n\n1. [Screenshots, logs or description]\n\n# Title\n\nThe title is a vital part of a bug report that allows the developer and triager to quickly identify a unique issue. A well-written title should contain a clear, brief explanation of the issue, emphasizing the most important points.\n\n        Clear example: Attack speed in Data Dragon is missing as of the last update\n\n        Unclear example: DDragon Wrong\n\n# Description\n\n**Preconditions**\n\nDescribing preconditions is a great start. Be sure to provide information on system configuration, project type, and languages used. Basically, we need everything that could help us set up the same environment you have.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**\n\nThis is the most important part of a bug report, as we&#39;ll use this information to reproduce the issue. The issue is more likely to be fixed if it can be reproduced.\n\nDescribe each step you have taken to reproduce the issue. Try to include as much information as possible\u2014sometimes even minor differences can be crucial.\n\n**Actual and Expected Results**\n\nThese sections will help us make sure that everybody involved in the fix is on the same page. Describe the result you expected to get and the result you actually observed after performing the steps.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nAdditional information is often requested when the bug report is processed. You can save time by providing browser logs, screenshots, or any other artifacts related to the issue as needed.\n"

(powered by [rapier])\n\n\n## Design principles\n\n* Use [bevy] types, resources and components when possible (`Vec3`, `Quat`, `Transform`, `Events`, etc.)\n* Provide a single API that works for both 2d and 3d.\n* Data oriented. Using this library should feel like its a part of [bevy].\n* Avoid asking the user to lookup in resources via *handles*. Data should be accessible and modifiable directly in components.\n* Hide the actual physics engine. This is an implementation detail the user shouldn't have to worry about.\n    * But, allow advanced users to access the underlying [rapier] resources, so the user is never blocked by a missing\n      element in the API of heron.\n\n\n## What it looks like\n\n```rust,no_run\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\nuse heron::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() {\n  App::new()\n    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n    .add_plugin(PhysicsPlugin::default()) // Add the plugin\n    .insert_resource(Gravity::from(Vec3::new(0.0, -9.81, 0.0))) // Optionally define gravity\n    .add_startup_system(spawn)\n    .run();\n}\n\nfn spawn(mut commands: Commands) {\n    commands\n\n        // Spawn any bundle of your choice. Only make sure there is a `GlobalTransform`\n        .spawn_bundle(SpriteBundle::default())\n\n        // Make it a rigid body\n        .insert(RigidBody::Dynamic)\n        \n        // Attach a collision shape\n        .insert(CollisionShape::Sphere { radius: 10.0 })\n        \n        // Optionally add other useful components...\n        .insert(Velocity::from_linear(Vec3::X * 2.0))\n        .insert(Acceleration::from_linear(Vec3::X * 1.0))\n        .insert(PhysicMaterial { friction: 1.0, density: 10.0, ..Default::default() })\n        .insert(RotationConstraints::lock())\n        .insert(CollisionLayers::none().with_group(Layer::Player).with_mask(Layer::World));\n}\n\n// Define your physics layers\n#[derive(PhysicsLayer)]\nenum Layer {\n    World,\n    Player,\n    Enemies,\n}\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\n* [guide and reference](https://docs.rs/heron)\n* [changelog](CHANGELOG.md)\n\n\n## MSRV\n\nThe minimum supported rust version is currently: `1.60`\n\n**It *may* be increased to a newer stable version in a minor release.** (but only if needed)\n\nIt *will* be increased to the latest stable version in a major release. (even if not needed)\n\n\n## Supported Bevy Versions\n\n| bevy | heron      |\n|------|------------|\n| 0.7  | 3          |\n| 0.6  | 1 - 2      |\n| 0.5  | 0.4 - 0.13 |\n| 0.4  | 0.1 - 0.3  |\n\n\n## How does this project compare to bevy_rapier?\n\n[bevy_rapier] plugin is an excellent option and should definitely be considered.\n\nHere are some key differences between the two projects:\n\n* `heron` tries to provide a smaller, simpler API that is easier to use. `bevy_rapier` is more complete and powerful, but a bit more complex.\n* `heron` mostly hides the underlying physics engine, so you don't have to use [rapier] directly nor [nalgebra]. `bevy_rapier` asks the user to deal directly with `rapier` and `nalgebra`.\n* `heron` is focused on games only. `bevy_rapier` targets all kind of physics simulation applications (incl. games).\n* `bevy_rapier` is actively maintained by [dimforge], the developer of `rapier`. `heron` is also active, but cannot evolve as fast as `bevy_rapier` can. \n\n\n`heron` is probably more suited for simple games and game-jams, where the ease of learn/use is especially valuable and where the lack of advanced feature isn't problematic.\n\n`bevy_rapier` is probably more suited for bigger/complex games and other types of physics simulations, where it may be better to learn/use a more exhaustive/complex API. \n\n\n## Contribute / Contact\n\nYou can open issues/discussions here or you can discuss with me (`Jomag#2675`) in the [bevy discord](https://discord.com/invite/gMUk5Ph)\n\nSee [how to contribute](https://github.com/jcornaz/heron/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n\n[bevy]: https://bevyengine.org\n[rapier]: https://rapier.rs\n[bevy_rapier]: https://github.com/dimforge/bevy_rapier\n[dimforge]: https://www.dimforge.com\n[nalgebra]: https://github.com/dimforge/nalgebra\n"

This app aims to simplify a little bit the process where it is possible by automating the scripting and launching of Windows Store apps and Xbox Game Pass games.\n\n# To add UWP or XGP games to Steam #\n\n[Download the latest version of UWPHook](https://github.com/BrianLima/UWPHook/releases) and store it somewhere on your PC.\n\nClick on the \ud83d\udd04 to load installed UWP Apps, we will find every UWP app and Xbox Game Pass game installed on your PC.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pjGfGHe.png)\n\nSelect every app you want to add to Steam, you can change the name by double clicking the \"name\" collumn, press \"Export selected apps to Steam\" and \ud83c\udf89, every app you selected will be added to Steam.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/on46CMQ.png)\n\nClose UWPHook, restart Steam if prompted, click play on your UWP game, and Steam will show your current game on your status as long as you are playing it!\n\n----------\n\n# SteamGridDB #\n\nSince v2.8, UWPHook can automatically import grid, icons and hero images from [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com)\n\nOn your first usage, the app will ask you if you want it to download images, redirecting you to the settings page.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/K0Cm4IL.png)\n\nBy adding a API Key obtained in the SteamGridDB preferences, UWPHook will try to find matching images for any exported games, giving you the following result:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mlvVdwb.png)\n\nYou can refine the images by using filters for animated images, blurred, no logo or memes for example, but it will always pick the first it finds for the filters automatically.\n\nSpecial thanks to @FusRoDah061 for implementing the base feature!\n\n# Troubleshooting #\n\n- **Steam's Overlay isn't working!**\n  - Unfortunately, it's a Steam limitation, Valve has to update it in order to work properly with UWP, DXTory is a recommended overlay for UWP games.\n- **Steam Link launches the game but input doesn't work!**\n  - Unfortunately, another limitation by Steam, i have some ideas as to why it isn't working, but i can't give an ETA for when i can fix this, or even if it's fixable on my end, since Valve didn't released the Link in Brazil and i can't get one to test.\n- **Steam Controller isn't working**\n  - Another limitation by Steam, some people reported it works with \"Desktop Mode\" configuration, but i can't verify this.\n- **My question isn't listed here!**\n  - Drop by our subreddit and ask a question over there, maybe someone will help you, i surely will as soon as i can\n **[https://www.reddit.com/r/uwphook](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwphook)**\n\n----------\n\n# Building #\n\n- Clone project or forked project.\n- Install Visual Studio 2019 with .NET Framework 4.6.2.\n- Install [SharpSteam by BrianLima](https://github.com/BrianLima/SharpSteam/releases/) and [VDFParser by heyvito](https://github.com/heyvito/VDFParser).\n- Add the above two dll to the project in Visual Studio Reference Manager.\n- Press run!\n\n----------\n\n# About #\n\nThis software is open-source under the MIT License.\n\nIf you like what i did with it and want to suport me, you can cheer me up at my [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/brianostorm \"Twitter\") or [pay me a coffee via Paypal, it will help me to continue to build amazing open source tools for you!\"](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=9YPV3FHEFRAUQ)\n\nThanks for your support, and game on!\n"

[Install Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)\n1. [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)\n1. Download or clone this repository\n\n## Setup\n1. Make sure that your Instant Game app is setup. For more information see [our Setup Guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/getting-started/app-setup)\n1. In the root folder of this repo, run\n\t```bash\n\t$ yarn install\n\t```\n1. Copy or rename the file `config.template.json` to `config.json` and replace the information needed from your app.\n\t```json\n\t{\n\t\t\"FB_appId\":\"<YOUR_APP_ID_HERE>\",\n\t\t\"FB_uploadAccessToken\": \"<YOUR_UPLOAD_TOKEN_HERE>\",\n\t\t...\n\t}\n\t```\nYour app ID can be found at the landing page of your app's dashboard.\n\nYour upload access token can be found on the Instant Games -> Web Hosting tab of your app's dashboard.\n\n## Client-side examples:\nClient-side examples are contained in the **`examples/`** folder:\n* **`ads`**: Shows how to display Rewarded Videos and Interstitial Ads\n* **`bots`**: Shows how to send data from the game client to a bot and vice-versa\n* **`cross-promo`**: Shows how to prompt the player to switch to another one of your Instant Games\n* **`hello-world`**: An empty project with the boilerplate in place to get you up and running quickly\n* **`in-app-purchases`**: Shows how to use payments inside of your Instant Game\n* **`leaderboards`**: Shows how to use leaderboards (global and context-specific) in your Instant Game\n* **`secure-backend`**: Shows how to validate data in your backend to make sure they are authentically coming from your Instant Game, to prevent cheating\n* **`sending-messages`**: Shows how to show messages from your game to the current context (conversation)\n* **`shortcuts`**: Shows how to create a mobile home shortcut to the game\n\n### Running Client-Side examples:\n\nIn order to run these examples you will need to use one of these tasks:\n* **`run-mock`**: Runs on localhost against a mocked version of the SDK\n* **`mock`**: It is the same as **`run-mock`**. Runs on localhost against a mocked version of the SDK\n* **`run-dist`**: Runs on localhost against the production SDK\n* **`dist`**: It is the same as **`run-dist`**. Runs on localhost against the production SDK\n* **`upload`**: Package and upload your game in order to test on mobile\n\nBelow are some examples of how to execute these tasks:\n\n```bash\n$ yarn run-mock --project hello-world\n```\nWill run the **`hello-world`** project from localhost against a mocked version of the SDK (returns dummy data for every call). This way of running projects is especially useful for quickly iterating on local changes done to any of the projects.\n\n```bash\n$ yarn run-dist --project sending-messages\n```\nThis will run the **`sending-messages`** project with HTTPS from localhost and embed it into [our embedded player](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games/instant-games/test-publish-share) which allows you to connect to the latest version of the SDK. All data returned from the SDK will be authentic an updated. In order to use this option, you need to correctly set the `FB_appId` property on `config.json`.  If the app shows stuck in 0% loading, make sure to visit `https://localhost:8000` and follow the instructions on your browser trust the development certificates.\n\n```bash\n$ yarn upload --project ads\n```\nThis will package and upload the **`ads`** example to Web Hosting. After that you can set the game to production mode in order to test it from the uploaded build - and not localhost. This option is especially useful since it allows you to test on mobile devices ([More information here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games/instant-games/test-publish-share))\n\n## Server-side examples\nServer-side examples are contained in the **`servers-examples/`** folder:\n* **`nodejs-backend`**: It's a working backend for the `secure-backend` client demo, that shows how to perform server-side validations for client-signed calls from Instant Games.\n* **`nodejs-bot`**: It's a working backend for the `bots` client demo, that shows how to send and receive structured data from a game client.\n\n### Running server-side examples\nBefore running any of the server side examples, make sure to copy or rename the `template.env` into `.env` and provide the necessary information.\n\n\nYou can run any of the server-side examples above by running the following commands on terminal:\n```\n$ cd /server-examples/nodejs-backend\n$ yarn install\n yarn install v1.7.0\n [1/4] Resolving packages...\n [2/4] Fetching packages...\n [3/4] Linking dependencies...\n [4/4] Building fresh packages...\n Done in 6.86s.\n$ node index\n Node app is running on port 5000\n```\nFrom that moment on, your server-side code is running on `http://localhost:5000`. By changing the client-side code to point to that endpoint, you can test the full end-to-end flow locally.\n\nAlternatively, you can host your backend code in a service such as [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)\n> Note: for the **`nodejs-bot`** server-side demo, you will need to host your backend in an external server.([More information here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games/instant-games/getting-started/bot-setup))\n\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) Facebook, Inc. and its affiliates.

  "readme_contents": "# Canvas Engine\nhttp://canvasengine.net\n\n## Description\n\nFramework to create video games in HTML5 Canvas\n\n## Get Started\n\nFollow the steps below to start:\n\n1. Download the code `canvasengine-X.Y.Z.all.min.js` on Github or this website\n2. Add this code in your page : \n        \n\t\t<!DOCTYPE html>\n\t\t<script src=\"canvasengine-X.Y.Z.all.min.js\"></script>\n\t\t<canvas id=\"canvas_id\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></canvas>\n\t\t\n       \n3. Initialize the canvas in your JS file :\n\n        var canvas = CE.defines(\"canvas_id\").ready(function() {\t\n         \n        });\n\nMethod `ready` is called when the canvas is ready (DOM loaded)\n\n## Use development files\n\nDevelopment files allows you to improve or correct CanvasEngine. To do this, insert these two files:\n\n        <!DOCTYPE html>\n        <script src=\"core/engine-common.js\"></script>\n\t\t<script src=\"canvasengine.js\"></script>\n\t\t<canvas id=\"canvas_id\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></canvas>\n\n> View other branches of CanvasEngine on Github, you'll other version under development\n\nIf you want to use features (Animation, Input, etc), add the appropriate files :\n\n    <script src=\"extends/Animation.js\"></script>\n\nIf you develop or modify a feature, you can use the global variable `Global_CE` to use other features.\n\nExample :\n\n    // In extends/your_feacture.js\n    Global_CE.Input.press(Input.Enter, function() {\n    });\n\n### Your code\n\nYour code contains classe(s) :\n\n    Class.create(\"My_Class\", {\n\n\n    });\n\nThe developer can use this class in his game. You can also add code like this:\n    \n    var My_Class = {\n    \tMy_Class: {\n    \t\tNew: function) {\n    \t\t\treturn Class.New(\"My_Class\");\n    \t\t}\n    \t}\n    };\n\nit will use the namespace defined initially by the user :\n\n    var canvas = CE.defines(\"canvas_id\").extend(My_Class).ready(function() {\t\n         canvas.Scene.call(\"MyScene\");\n    });\n\n    canvas.Scene.new({\n      name: \"MyScene\",\n      ready: function(stage) {\n         var foo = canvas.My_Class.New();\n      }\n    });\n\n### Documentation\n\nTry to properly document the code for developer :\n\n    /**\n        @doc my_class\n        @class Definition of \"My Class\"\n        @example\n\n            ...\n\n    */\n    Class.create(\"My_Class\", {\n\n    /**\n      @doc my_class/\n      @method foo ...\n      @param bar {String} ...\n      @example\n\n            ...\n\n    */\n         foo: function(bar) {\n\n         }\n\n    });\n\nSee [http://canvasengine.net/doc](http://canvasengine.net/doc)\n\n\n## Features\n\n**Low-level API**\n\n* Fullscreen support (Supported platforms).\n* Multiple image file formats: DDS, JPG, PNG and TGA.\n    * Define a transparent color\n* Scene Structure\n    * Overlay scenes \n    * Pause scene\n* Multiplayer model\n* Preloading\n    * Get the percentage of loading\n* Elements Manipulation\n    * Manipulation : jQuery syntaxe\n    * Draw : HTML5 Canvas API syntaxe\n* Utilities\n    * merge object\n    * class\n\n**Windows**\n\n* Dialog box with the outline\n* Cursor\n\n**Animations**\n\n* Set an animation from a spritesheet\n* Frequence and animation speed\n* Sequence of multiple image\n* Creating a custom animation with multiple sequences\n* Display once, loop or temporary\n\n**Timeline (aka Tween)**\n\n* Easy to make interpolations effects\n* 29 Effects :\n    * easeInQuad, easeOutQuad, easeInCubic, easeOutCubic, etc.\n* Loop\n\n**Collision**\n\n* Entities model\n* Test collision with virtual grid\n* Polygon intersection and Contains Point.\n\n**Text**\n\n* Set maximum line width\n* Display effect\n    * Line by line\n    * Character by character\n* font file formats : TTF, EOT\n* external fonts  \n    * Google Fonts\n    * Fontdeck\n    * Fonts.com\n    * Typekit\n\n**Sound**\n\n* Multiple sound file formats: OGG, WAV, MP3.\n* Fading effects\n* Web Audio or SoundManager2\n\n**Effects**\n\n* Change tone screen\n* Perform a flash\n* Shake screen\n\n**Scrolling**\n\n\n**Level Design**\n\n* Tiled Map Editor (http://www.mapeditor.org)\n* Gleed 2d (http://gleed2d.codeplex.com)\n\n**Save & Load**\n\n* Encoding with BISON.js\n\n**Spritesheet Management**\n\n**Input**\n\n* Access to input types: Keyboard, Mouse, Xbox360 Pad, Joysticks\n* click, dbclick, mousemove, mouseup, mousedown, mouseout, mouseover*\n* Multi-Touch with Hammer.js : \n    * hold\n    * tap\n    * doubletap\n    * drag, dragstart, dragend, dragup, dragdown, dragleft, dragright\n    * swipe, swipeup, swipedown, swipeleft, swiperight\n    * transform, transformstart, transformend\n    * rotate\n    * pinch, pinchin, pinchout\n    * touch (gesture detection starts)\n    * release (gesture detection ends)\n\n## Roadmap (in order)\n\n### v1.5\n\n* Box2d\n* Synchronized multi canvas (local multiplayer)\n\n### v2.0\n\n* Users and Groups Management for multiplayer model\n* CSS drawing\n\n## Test performance\n\n### v1.0.6\n\n* [Native class and CanvasEngine Class 1](http://jsperf.com/native-class-and-canvasengine-class)\n* [Native class and CanvasEngine Class 2](http://jsperf.com/native-class-and-canvasengine-class-test2)\n\n## Contributors\n\n* [robwalch](https://github.com/robwalch) - [commit](https://github.com/robwalch/CanvasEngine/commit/e55909952c26ba1ec3e3d5bd6f733ddfffc4b647)\n* [scottbw](https://github.com/scottbw) - [commit](https://github.com/RSamaium/CanvasEngine/commit/9600681d945c3efb8cea04391c2df0e12f843716)\n* [SomeKittens](https://github.com/SomeKittens) - [commit](https://github.com/SomeKittens/CanvasEngine/commit/a934af7bf32799434a53876f346b80ef0da1b3e5)\n* [TheOnly92](https://github.com/TheOnly92) - [commit](https://github.com/RSamaium/CanvasEngine/commit/d83a2f5512efb206bef96cf76e68f438f1f45b16)\n\n## Changelog\n\n### v1.4.0 (dev)\n\n* Add functionality : User Interface\n    * Preset\n    * Button\n    * Tooltip\n    * Drag&Drop\n    * Background\n* Add weather effects : `rain()`, `snow()` and `storm()`\n* Improves `offset()`.

As of this writing,\n    the only server is \"us1\".\n\n    The different API *modules* are available by calling the respective\n    module name as a method on the client object. The returned object then\n    implements the various methods.\n\n    The return values of the methods are (currently) just exactly \"result\"\n    portion of the deflated JSON responses. This is subject to change!\n\n    On failure, the methods \"croak\" with a simple to parse message. Example:\n\n      RPC Error (1002): Empire does not exist. at ...\n\n    The number is the error code number (see API docs).

  "readme_contents": "TheGamesDB.net\n==============\n\nhttp://thegamesdb.net\n\nThis site serves as a frontend to a complete database of video games.\n\nThe site includes artwork and metadata that can be incorporated into various HTPC software and plug-ins via our API.\n\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\nFirst, you will need to download a copy of the code. If you are unfamiliar with GitHub, the easiest way to do this is to click the \"ZIP\" button at the top of our GitHub page.\n\nTo get the site to run locally, you will need to install and configure the following components:\n\n<dl>\n  <dt>> Apache (v2.4.2 or Recommended)</dt>\n  <dd>Additional Requirements: rewrite_module</dd>\n  <dt>> MySQL (v5.5.8 or Recommended)</dt>\n  <dd>Additional Requirements: fulltext minimum word length should be set to 1 for searching game titles that include a single number in the title.</dd>\n  <dt>> PHP 5 (v5.3 or v5.4 Recommended)</dt>\n  <dd>Additional Requirements: Settings - short open tag (on) - Please Note: as of 23/09/2013 \"register globals\" is no longer required to be enabled... since PHP 5.4 has removed support for this, we had to introduce a Shiv in the code. As a result, you may want to alter your php error reporting settings to not display errors, as several uninitialized variables currently remain in use.</dd>\n</dl>\n\nThe quickest way to install and configure these components is by using XAMPP/LAMP on Linux, MAMP on Mac, or XAMPP/WAMP on Windows. You can also use vagrant, as described below.\n\nOnce these components are installed you will want to extract the site code into your www or httpdocs directory.\n\nThe next step is to create a blank database and then configure the basic system settings. To do this copy and rename the \"config.template.php\" file to \"config.php\". Then open up this new file in your favorite text editor, and insert your database connection settings and Base URL settings. Please note that the base url you enter should not contain a trailing slash.\n\nThe easiest way to get sample data for this system is to use our TGDB Development Pack, you could also use the \"sample_db.sql\" file that is in the root of our GitHub repository, however we cannot guarantee that this file is up to date and is has no sample data to work with, just a blank database schema for posterity.\n\nThe TGDB Development Pack:\n--------------------------\n\n> Where do I get it?\n\nYou can download the TGDB Dev Pack from the following link: http://thegamesdb.net/tgdb-dev-pack.zip\n\n*It is roughly 40MB so be sure to do it on a connection that doesn't charge you per MB!*\n\n> What is it?\n\nThe TGDB Dev Pack is a resource pack that is intended to aid the coding community to contribute to TheGamesDB.net's source code.\nThe pack provides you with a small set of sample data and imagery which can be used as a test bed when coding for this project.\nTwo users have already been created for you. There is an administrator account (username: \"admin\"), and a standard user account (username: \"user\")... The password for either of these users is very simply \"password\".\nTo assist you in finding useful games, any games that have associated art available have been added as \"favourite\" games for both of these users.\n\n> How do I install it?\n\nSimply overwrite the \"banners\" folder that came with the original source code that you should have already grabbed, using the one included in this pack as a replacement.\n\nFinally, import the \"tgdb-dev[dd-mm-yyyy].sql\" file into your pre-configured MySQL database using your tool of choice (PhpMyAdmin, Navicat, MySQL Workbench, MySQL Console).\n\nThat's It!\n----------\n\n*Now you should be good to go! Navigate to your web-server's url (typically \"http://localhost\" for local web-servers such as WAMP/LAMP/MAMP/XAMPP)in your favorite browser and see if it all works!*\n\nVagrant\n-------\n\nThere is a \"Vagrantfile\" in this repository that can be used to bring up a VirtualBox test VM with the site and the TGDB development pack. It basically follows the instructions provided above inside a base Ubuntu 14.04 installation. Just issue a \"vagrant up\" and access http://localhost:8888/\n\n"

The config file supports [JSON5](https://json5.org/) syntax (comments, trailing commas, etc). For each property, the JSON config value takes priority over the respective environment variable value.\r\n\r\nFor details on each option, its defaults, and environment variable key, see the [config documentation site](https://claabs.github.io/epicgames-freegames-node/classes/AppConfig.html).\r\n\r\nThe config file is stored in the mounted `/usr/app/config` volume and can be named `config.json` or `config.json5`.\r\n\r\n#### `config.json` or `config.json5`\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n{\r\n  \"runOnStartup\": true,\r\n  \"cronSchedule\": \"5 16 * * *\",\r\n  \"logLevel\": \"info\",\r\n  \"webPortalConfig\": {\r\n    \"baseUrl\": \"https://epic.exmaple.com\",\r\n  },\r\n  \"accounts\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"email\": \"example@gmail.com\",\r\n      \"password\": \"abc1234\",\r\n      \"totp\": \"EMNCF83ULU3K3PXPJBSWY3DPEHPK3PXPJWY3DPEHPK3YI69R39NE\"\r\n    },\r\n  ],\r\n  \"notifiers\": [\r\n    // You may configure as many of any notifier as needed\r\n    // Here are some examples of each type\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"email\",\r\n      \"smtpHost\": \"smtp.gmail.com\",\r\n      \"smtpPort\": 587,\r\n      \"emailSenderAddress\": \"hello@gmail.com\",\r\n      \"emailSenderName\": \"Epic Games Captchas\",\r\n      \"emailRecipientAddress\": \"hello@gmail.com\",\r\n      \"secure\": false,\r\n      \"auth\": {\r\n          \"user\": \"hello@gmail.com\",\r\n          \"pass\": \"abc123\",\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"discord\",\r\n      \"webhookUrl\": \"https://discord.com/api/webhooks/123456789123456789/A-abcdefghijklmn-abcdefghijklmnopqrst12345678-abcdefghijklmnop123456\",\r\n      // Optional list of users or roles to mention\r\n      \"mentionedUsers\": [\"914360712086843432\"],\r\n      \"mentionedRoles\": [\"734548250895319070\"],\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"telegram\",\r\n      \"token\": \"644739147:AAGMPo-Jz3mKRnHRTnrPEDi7jUF1vqNOD5k\",\r\n      \"chatId\": \"-987654321\",\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"apprise\",\r\n      \"apiUrl\": \"http://192.168.1.2:8000\",\r\n      \"urls\": \"mailto://user:pass@gmail.com\",\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"pushover\",\r\n      \"token\": \"a172fyyl9gw99p2xi16tq8hnib48p2\",\r\n      \"userKey\": \"uvgidym7l5ggpwu2r8i1oy6diaapll\",\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"gotify\",\r\n      \"apiUrl\": \"https://gotify.net\",\r\n      \"token\": \"SnL-wAvmfo_QT\",\r\n    },\r\n  ],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Captchas\r\n\r\nEpic Games currently serves captchas and bot detection to its login and checkout pages. This project works around the issue in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. hCaptcha accessibility cookies\r\n1. Sending you captchas\r\n\r\n#### hCaptcha accessibility cookies\r\n\r\n**This is currently unavailable. See [#178](https://github.com/claabs/epicgames-freegames-node/issues/178) for details.**\r\n\r\nhCaptcha offers an accessibility tool for vision impaired users that can be used to bypass captchas served by Epic Games. It's very simple to set up:\r\n\r\n1. Go [here](https://dashboard.hcaptcha.com/signup?type=accessibility) and enter an email you have access to\r\n1. In your email inbox find an email titled \"Instructions for using hCaptcha Accessibility\"\r\n1. Right-click the \"Get Accessibility Cookie\" button and copy its link address\r\n1. Add the link to your config as the `hcaptchaAccessibilityUrl` option\r\n\r\n#### Sending you captchas\r\n\r\nFor whatever reason, if your IP/account loses trust with hCaptcha, this project can notify and have you manually solve a captcha. To use this requires:\r\n\r\n* Access to one of the [notification methods](https://claabs.github.io/epicgames-freegames-node/classes/AppConfig.html#notifiers) (Discord, Telegram, email, Apprise, Pushover, etc.)\r\n* Configuring the captcha solving page webserver\r\n  * Either via local IP or reverse proxy/port forwarding (if you don't know what this means, use the next option)\r\n  * Or by using [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.me) to very easily remotely tunnel the webserver\r\n\r\nSee below for detailed instructions on each requirement.\r\n\r\n##### Webserver setup\r\n\r\n1. Expose port 3000 in your Docker run config (e.g. `-p 81:3000` maps the host machine's port 81 to the container's port 3000)\r\n1. If you want to access the Captcha solving page from outside your network, setup any port forwarding/reverse proxy/DNS\r\n1. Set the `webPortalConfig.baseUrl` in the config\r\n1. The web portal uses WebSocket to communicate. If you're using a reverse proxy, you may need additional configuration to enable WebSocket. [This guide from Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/wiki/Reverse-Proxy) covers most scenarios.\r\n\r\n##### Localtunnel setup\r\n\r\nIf you don't have the ability to port forward/reverse proxy on your network, you can still access captcha remotely by setting:\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n{\r\n  \"webPortalConfig\": {\r\n    \"localtunnel\": true,\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nin your `config.json`.\r\n\r\n##### Notification setup\r\n\r\nEach notification method has unique setup instructions. Read [its documentation]([notification methods](https://claabs.github.io/epicgames-freegames-node/classes/AppConfig.html#notifiers)) on the config site for exact details and instructions. The [example config](https://claabs.github.io/epicgames-freegames-node/classes/AppConfig.html) may also help as an example.\r\n\r\n##### Testing notification and webserver\r\n\r\nSince captcas may not always appear, the notification methods and webserver can be manually tested. Essentially, you just need to add:\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n  \"testNotifiers\": true,\r\n```\r\n\r\nto the root of your `config.json`. For more details check out the [config docs](https://claabs.github.io/epicgames-freegames-node/classes/AppConfig.html#testNotifiers).\r\n\r\n#### Two-factor login\r\n\r\nEpic has begun [enforcing two-factor](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/two-factor-authentication-required-when-claiming-free-games) when claiming some free games. It rarely may be necessary for some free games when using this tool.\r\n\r\nIf you have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled on your account, you need to add your TOTP secret as an environment variable. To get your TOTP secret, you may need to redo your 2FA setup:\r\n\r\n1. Go [here](https://www.epicgames.com/account/password) to enable 2FA.\r\n1. Click \"enable authenticator app.\"\r\n1. In the section labeled \"manual entry key,\" copy the key.\r\n1. Use your authenticator app to add scan the QR code.\r\n1. Activate 2FA by completing the form and clicking activate.\r\n1. Once 2FA is enabled, use the key you copied as the value for the TOTP parameter.\r\n\r\nIf you can't get 2FA working with this tool, try enabling `MAKE PRIMARY` for \"Authenticator App\" in your Epic account settings.\r\n\r\n### Docker Configuration\r\n\r\nThis image is available from both [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/claabs/epicgames-freegames-node/pkgs/container/epicgames-freegames-node) and [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/charlocharlie/epicgames-freegames):\r\n\r\n* `ghcr.io/claabs/epicgames-freegames-node:latest`\r\n* `charlocharlie/epicgames-freegames:latest`\r\n\r\nIf you're [experiencing issues with Chromium starting](https://github.com/claabs/epicgames-freegames-node/issues/164) (hangs on login/notification), you can try the Debian image:\r\n\r\n* `ghcr.io/claabs/epicgames-freegames-node:bullseye-slim`\r\n* `charlocharlie/epicgames-freegames:bullseye-slim`\r\n\r\nIf you are using full JSON configuration, the only remaining Docker configurables are the [port](#ports) and [volume](#volumes).\r\n\r\n#### Environment Variables\r\n\r\nMost configuration options can be set via environment variable. Look for the `env` tag in the [config docs](https://claabs.github.io/epicgames-freegames-node/classes/AppConfig.html) for each option's key.\r\n\r\nIf for whatever reason you want to change the default config directory or config file name, `CONFIG_DIR` and `CONFIG_FILE_NAME` are available as environment variables.\r\n\r\n#### Ports\r\n\r\n| Host port | Container port | Description                                                                   |\r\n|-----------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| `3000`    | `3000`         | Port mapping on which the web server hosting the captcha solving page resides |\r\n\r\n#### Volumes\r\n\r\n| Host location   | Container location | Mode | Description                               |\r\n|-----------------|--------------------|------|-------------------------------------------|\r\n| `/my/host/dir/` | `/usr/app/config`  | `rw` | Location of the config and cookie file(s) |\r\n\r\n#### Memory Limit\r\n\r\nIt's recommended to add `-m 2g` as a `docker run` parameter to set a max memory usage of 2GB. The Chromium processes can sometimes run away, and without a limit your system will eventually lock up.\r\n\r\n### Docker Run\r\n\r\n#### With JSON Config\r\n\r\n`$ docker run -d -v /my/host/dir/:/usr/app/config:rw -p 3000:3000 -m 2g charlocharlie/epicgames-freegames:latest`\r\n\r\n#### Without JSON Config\r\n\r\nWithout JSON config, you can only configure one account.\r\n\r\n`$ docker run -d -e TZ=America/Chicago -e EMAIL=example@gmail.com -e PASSWORD=abc123 -e TOTP=ABC123 -e RUN_ON_STARTUP=true -e BASE_URL=https://example.com -e SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com -e SMTP_PORT=587 -e SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com -e EMAIL_SENDER_ADDRESS=hello@gmail.com -e EMAIL_SENDER_NAME=\"Epic Games Captchas\" -e EMAIL_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS=hello@gmail.com -e SMTP_SECURE=true -e SMTP_USERNAME=hello@gmail.com -e SMTP_PASSWORD=abc123 -v /my/host/dir/:/usr/app/config:rw -p 3000:3000 -m 2g charlocharlie/epicgames-freegames:latest`\r\n\r\n### Cookie Import\r\n\r\nIf you're experiencing issues logging in with username and password, you can import cookies for a temporary session.\r\n\r\n1. Setup the container per the below instructions\r\n1. In your web browser, log in to the Epic Games Store with \"Remember me\" checked.\r\n1. Install the [EditThisCookie](http://www.editthiscookie.com/) browser extension.\r\n1. While viewing the Epic Games Store page, open the EditThisCookie extension window, change the URL to `https://www.epicgames.com/id`, and click the export button:\r\n![EditThisCookie export button](https://github.com/claabs/epicgames-freegames-node/blob/master/img/edit-this-cookie.png?raw=true)\r\n1. In your mounted `./config` folder, create `<email_address>-cookies.json` (e.g. `me@example.com-cookies.json`), and paste in your cookies.\r\n1.

Each header has a LIBNAME_IMPLEMENTATION symbol; add this to a single translation unit in your code and include the header right after in order to define library symbols. Just include the header as normal otherwise.\n\nExamples and Tests\n------------------\n\nSome headers also have example code or demos. In this repo just look for the corresponding examples or tests folders. The example folders are particularly useful for figuring out how to use a particular header.\n\nContact\n-------\n\nHere's a link to the discord chat for cute_headers. Feel free to pop in and ask questions, make suggestions, or have a discussion. If anyone has used cute_headers it would be great to hear your experience! https://discord.gg/2DFHRmX\n\nAnother easy way to get a hold of me is on twitter [@randypgaul](https://twitter.com/RandyPGaul).\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n> - *What's the point of making a single file? Why is there implementation and static functions in the headers?*\n\nIncluding these headers is like including a normal header. However, to define the implementation each header looks something like this:\n\n```c\n// Do this ONCE in a .c/.cpp file\n#define LIBNAME_IMPLEMENTATION\n#include \"libname.h\"\n\n// Everywhere else, just include like a typical header\n#include \"libname.h\"\n```\n\nThis will turn the file into a header + c file combo, one time. The point of this is: A) handling the header or sending it to people is easy, no zip files or anything just copy and paste a single file; B) build scripts are a pain in the ass, and these single-file libs can be integrated into any project without modifying a single build script.\n\n> - *Doesn't writing all the code in a header ruin compile times?*\n\nThe stigma that header implementations slow compile time come from inline'd code and template spam. In either case every single [translation unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_unit_(programming)) must churn through the header and place inline versions of functions, or for templates generate various type-specific functions. It gets worse once the linker kicks in and needs to coalesce translation units together, deleting duplicated symbols. Often linkers are single-threaded tasks and can really bottleneck build times.\n\nA well constructed single-file header will not use any templates and make use of inline sparingly. Additionally well constructed single-file headers use a #define to place implementation (the function definitions and symbols) into a **single** translation unit. In this way a well crafted single-file header is pretty much the best thing a C compiler can come across, as far as build times go. Especially when the header can optionally #define out unneeded features.\n\n> - *Aren't these header only libraries just a new fad?*\n\nI personally don't really know if it's a fad or not, but these files aren't really just headers. They are headers with the .C file part (the implementation) attached to the end. It's two different files stuck together with the C preprocessor, but the implementation part never shows up unless the user does #define LIB_IMPLEMENTATION. This define step is the only integration step required to use these headers.\n\nUnfortunately writing a good header library is pretty hard, so just any random header lib out there in the wild is probably not a good one. The [STB](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwihsabx0qHSAhVX0WMKHVnyAZ0QFggaMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnothings%2Fstb&usg=AFQjCNHkcM-rQ-cn3VbNhQZ3lnwpnSrCWQ&sig2=bg0yIt7IhNkQy6_nMcuYZw&bvm=bv.147448319,d.cGc) and [RJM](https://github.com/rmitton/rjm) are pretty good header libs, and are a good reference to get an idea at what a good header lib looks like. [Mattias Gustavsson](https://github.com/mattiasgustavsson/libs) has my favorite collection of headers.\n\n> - *What is the license?*\n\nEach lib contains license info at the end of the file. There is a choice between public domain, and zlib.\n\n> - *I was looking for a header I've seen before, but it's missing. Where did it go?*\n\nSome of the unpopular or not so useful headers became deprecated, and [live here now](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_headers_deprecated).\n"

Game\ncartridges (ROMs) are small, self-contained `.wasm` files that can be built with any programming\nlanguage that compiles to WebAssembly.\n\n> Development status: \u26a1 Alpha\n\n## Key Features\n\n* **No Glue Code**: If you've ever tried to write even a simple \"Hello World\"\n  with WebAssembly before, you'll know it usually involves writing a bunch of\n  JS and HTML glue. WASM-4 removes all of that, games interface directly with\n  the system through a small API.\n\n* **Minimalist**: Fantasy consoles force developers to work with limited resources.\n  This makes them simple to learn, and easier to focus on finishing your game.\n\n* **Language Agnostic**: Use any programming language, as long as it can compile to WebAssembly. Out\n  of the box we currently support: AssemblyScript, C/C++, D, Go, Nelua, Nim, Odin, Rust, WAT, and\n  Zig.\n\n* **Portable**: WASM-4 is designed to run on any device that can execute WebAssembly, even outside\n  of the web! We're planning a lightweight implementation written in C that will run even on a\n  potato.\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 60 Second Quickstart\n\n```shell\n# Install the w4 command\nnpm install -g wasm4\n\n# Create a project\nw4 new --assemblyscript hello-world\n\n# Setup toolchain\ncd hello-world\nnpm install\n\n# Build and run your game!\nnpm run build\nw4 run build/cart.wasm\n```\n\nFor more info and guides, check the [full documentation](https://wasm4.org/docs).\n\n## \ud83c\udfae Hardware Specs\n\n- Display: 160x160 pixels, 4 customizable colors, updated at 60 Hz.\n- Memory: 64 KB linear RAM, memory-mapped I/O, save states.\n- Cartridge Size Limit: 64 KB.\n- Input: Keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, up to 4 gamepads.\n- Audio: 2 pulse wave channels, 1 triangle wave channel, 1 noise channel.\n- Disk Storage: 1024 bytes.\n\n## \ud83d\ude4f Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! Here are just a few ways to help:\n\n- **Build a game or experiment, we'll feature it on wasm4.org!**\n- Improve our documentation or write a tutorial.\n- Submit a bug report or feature request on Github.\n- Answer questions on the discussions forum.\n- Implement support for a new tool or language.\n- Give the project a star on Github for visibility.\n"

Feel free to open an issue or PR!\n\n## Building and Deploying a Quicksilver application\n\nQuicksilver should always compile and run on the latest stable version of Rust, for both web and\ndesktop.\n\nMake sure to put all your assets in a top-level folder of your crate called `static/`. *All*\nQuicksilver file loading-APIs will expect paths that originate in the static folder, so\n`static/image.png` should be referenced as `image.png`.\n\n### Linux dependencies\n\nOn Windows and Mac, all you'll need to build Quicksilver is a recent stable version of `rustc`\nand `cargo`. A few of Quicksilver's dependencies require Linux packages to build, namely\n`libudev`, `zlib`, and `alsa`. To install these on Ubuntu or Debian, run the command\n`sudo apt install libudev-dev zlib1g-dev alsa libasound2-dev`.\n\n### Deploying for desktop\n\nIf you're deploying for desktop platforms, build in release mode (`cargo build --release`)\nand copy the executable file produced (found at \"target/release/\") and any assets you used\n(image files, etc.) and create an archive (on Windows a zip file, on Unix a tar file). You\nshould be able to distribute this archive with no problems; if there are any, please open an\nissue.\n\n### Deploying for the web\n\nIf you're deploying for the web, first make sure you've\n[installed the cargo web tool](https://github.com/koute/cargo-web). Then use `cargo web deploy`\nto build your application for distribution (located at `target/deploy`).\n\nIf you want to test your application locally, use `cargo web start --features quicksilver/stdweb` and open your\nfavorite browser to the port it provides.\n\n#### wasm-bindgen support\n\nQuicksilver has recently gained experimental support for `wasm-bindgen`, under the `web-sys`\nfeature. The workflow is not currently documented here, but it should be the same as using any other\nlibrary with `wasm-bindgen`.\n\n## Optional Features\n\nQuicksilver by default tries to provide all features a 2D application may need, but not all\napplications need these features.\n\nThe optional features available are:\n- easy logging (via [log](https://github.com/rust-lang/log),\n[simple_logger](https://github.com/borntyping/rust-simple_logger), and\n[web_logger](https://github.com/yewstack/web_logger))\n- gamepad event generation (via [gilrs](https://gitlab.com/gilrs-project/gilrs))\n- saving (via [gestalt](https://github.com/ryanisaacg/gestalt))\n- font rendering (via [elefont](https://github.com/ryanisaacg/elefont)) and TTF parsing (via [rusttype](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/rusttype))\n\nEach are enabled by default, but you can\n[specify which features](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#choosing-features)\nyou actually want to use.\n\n## Supported Platforms\n\nThe engine is supported on Windows, macOS, Linux, and the web via WebAssembly.\n\nMobile support would be a future possibility, but likely only through external contributions.\n\n"

Hopefully this will provide a quick summary of what\nyou need to know to build and play with this remarkable system. Feel free\nto read through my thesis (available at the URL above) to find out more about\nthe inner workings of the system and to read more up on the games themselves.\nIn general, GAMESMAN is provided to allow the interested game theorist to:\n\n* Learn new games interactively\n* Explore how changing the rules affects the play of the games.\n* Teach themselves strategies of the game with the \"Value Moves\" option.\n* Program in new games (modules) and add them to the Gamesman database.\n\nGAMES\n=====\n\nThe games packaged with this distribution are:\n\n* 1210 (Inline nim) Available in both X-window & text versions\n* 3spot (3-Spot) Available in both X-window & text versions\n* achi (Achi) Available in both X-window & text versions\n* blocking (Meta Game - Blocking) Available in text version only\n* ctoi (Chung Toi) Available in both X-window & text versions\n* win4 (Connect 4) Available in both X-window & text versions\n* con (Connections) Available in both X-window & text versions\n* cmass (Critical Mass) Available in both X-window & text versions \n* dodgem (from Winning Ways, p 685) Available in both X-window & text versions\n* graph (general-purpose graph solver) Available in text version only\n* iceblocks (Ice Blocks) Available in both X-window & text versions\n* Lgame (The L Game) Available in both X-window & text versions\n* lite3 (Lite 3) Available in both X-window & text versions\n* mancala (Mancala) Available in both X-window & text versions\n* tore (Mu Torere) Available in both X-window & text versions\n* nim (Nim) Available in both X-window & text versions\n* qx (Quick Cross) Available in both X-window & text versions\n* rubix (Rubiks Magic) Available in both X-window & text versions\n* stt (Shift-Tac-Toe) Available in both X-window & text versions\n* sim (Sim) Available in both X-window & text versions\n* slideN (SlideN) Available in both X-window & text versions\n* snake (Snake) Available in both X-window & text versions\n* tactix (2-D Nim) Available in both X-window & text versions\n* ttt (Tic Tac Toe) Available in both X-window & text versions\n* wuzhi (WuZhiQi) Available in both X-window & text versions\n\nNEW 2003 FEATURES\n=================\n- by Sunil Ramesh\n\n* Added Database capability\n* Added goAgain (really Brian did!)\n* Cleaned up versions of others\n\nNEW 1999 FEATURES\n=================\n\nI spent some time this summer, and have finally put in the ability to:\n\n* Solve loopy games (such as dodgem) correctly!\n* Modify more game characteristics other than just standard / reverse.\n* Verify if the game database is corrupted somehow (good for programmers)\n\nBUILDING\n========\n\nPlease refer to the \"doc\" folder for instructions to build GAMESMAN.\n\nDEVELOPERS\n==========\n\nIf you want to add a game to Gamesman, talk to me and I'll try to provide\nyou with help. Then I'll add your game to my system! Here are some games\nwhich would fit in perfectly:\n\n* Achi\n* Fox and Geese (almost finished!)\n* 5x5 Connect 4\n* 5x5 Tic Tac Toe (middle is both X _and_ O)\n* DeBono's Red/White/Blue and get to 12 game\n\nPLAYING\n=======\n\nThere's a top-level utility that takes care of all the graphical programs,\nwhich is bin/XGamesman - just run that and click the buttons and it will\nrun the other programs. Each program should be self-explanatory, and they\nhave the same interface, which should make learning each new game easier.\n\nI hope GAMESMAN provides you hours of enjoyment!\n\nDan Garcia\n1999-08-26\nUC Berkeley\n"

  "readme_contents": "Turbo Badger - Fast UI toolkit for hardware accelerated games & applications.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI created Turbo Badger because i wanted a small UI toolkit for use in games and\nhardware accelerated applications across multiple platforms (that target both\ndesktop and mobile).\n\nThe goal is a toolkit that can be easily integrated into an existing codebase to\nmake UI with skinning.\n\nIt has no dependency on stl, RTTI or exceptions. Compiling without these features\nmakes footprint very small. Utility classes (such as string, lists, hash table,\netc.) are quite minimal for the basic needs of Turbo Badger itself.\n\nSee [integration.txt](integration.txt) for details about integrating image loading,\nrenderer, font system etc.\n\n\nBETA notice\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAPIs are changed, features improved & added. Be aware that if you use this right\nnow, you'll probably have to adjust your code to API changes sometimes after\npulling master. Documentation about API changes take place in the git commit\nchangelog for now ;)\n\n\nLicense\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied warranty. In no\nevent will the authors be held liable for any damages arising from the use of this\nsoftware.\n\nPermission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose, including\ncommercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it freely, subject to the\nfollowing restrictions:\n\n  1. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented; you must not claim\n  that you wrote the original software. If you use this software in a product,\n  an acknowledgment in the product documentation would be appreciated but is not\n  required.\n\n  2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be\n  misrepresented as being the original software.\n\n  3. This notice may not be removed or altered from any source distribution.\n\n\nWhat features does it have\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCore:\n\n  * Widgets (many common standard widgets)\n  * Text editing widget (With clipboard, undo/redo, styling functionality,\n    embedded content (read only)...)\n  * Extendable skin system with automatic runtime atlas creation,\n    Expand (shadows & glow without nasty margin hacks),\n    conditions (simple selectors), overrides, overlays, children, multiple\n    pixel density support etc.\n  * Automatic widget layout (No need to specify widget dimensions by pixels)\n  * Text based UI resource format, supporting conditions etc.\n  * Keyboard friendly (tab focus etc.)\n  * Message handling, with delayed/timed messages.\n  * All containers are scrollable/pannable (automatically from mouse/finger\n    interaction, and following focus).\n  * Very failproof event handling.\n  * Widget connections (synchronize multiple widgets with \"widget-values\")\n  * Language string handling\n  * No dependency on stl, exceptions, RTTI\n  * Very portable & easy to implement new backends (Image loading, fonts,\n    renderer)\n  * Support 32/64bit architectures and tested on Windows/Linux/Mac/iOS/Android\n  * Uses constexpr by default for all ID comparisions on compilers that support\n    it.\n  * Unicode support (UTF8)\n  * Multiple font systems can be used (Implementations of TBBF, freetype and stbf\n    provided)\n  * Animation system.\n  * Unit tests.\n\n\nThe code design & developing Turbo Badger\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you try to familiarize yourself with the code, you might notice the heavily used\nobject `TBID` that may seem like a string. It's actually an uint32 that can be set\nfrom a string (using the strings hash value). It's used for hash keys, as\nsubstitute for enums and all kind of things needing custom IDs.\n\nWith compilers supporting C++ 11 `constexpr`, the string to integer conversion is\ndone compile time.\n\nIf you want to add new stuff, here are some hints that will make it easier to get a\npull requests accepted:\n\n  * Do not make it dependant on exceptions, RTTI or stl (or boost or similar)\n\n  * It should not leak or crash if running out of memory.\n\n  * Follow the used code style (4 spaces wide tabs, indentation & whitespace style,\n    documentation etc.)\n\n  * Features that may be optional should be optional and not tied to the core.\n\n\nCreating custom widgets\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWidgets are cheap to create and layout and using many widgets to get what you want\nis encouraged. A custom widget should typically not implement any layouting and\ndrawing of sub-elements if it can be solved by wrapping a TBLayout and other\nexisting widgets.\n\nAny widget may contain other widgets and may control into which sub-widget other\nwidgets are inflated from resources (using `TBWidget::GetContentRoot`).\n\nCustom widgets can be inflated from UI resources too. See the use of the\n`TB_WIDGET_FACTORY` macro in `tb_widgets_reader.cpp` for examples on how to do\nthis.\n\n\nBuilding the demo\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe demo use GLFW as a submodule for some platform window & input handling.\nAfter the first git clone, you need to run:\n\n\tgit submodule init\n\tgit submodule update\n\nThis will clone GLFW into the right directory.\n\nThere is project files for Visual Studio 2012 in Demo/VisualStudio.\nFor other platforms/compilers, you need to first run cmake to generate makefile or\nprojects for your favorite IDE.\n\nThere's a Sublime Text project for a small Android test app in DemoAndroid with a\ncustom build & deploy script (Windows .bat file. There's currently no Linux/Mac\nscripts).\n\n\nAuthor\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEmil Seger\u00e5s\nWeb: <http://fiffigt.com>  \n\nTurbo Badger home: <https://github.com/fruxo/turbobadger>  \n\n\nScreenshot\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome of the windows in the Demo application for desktop, using the default skin.\n\n![Default skin](Demo/screenshot/screenshot_01.png)\n"

It's Space Invaders in JavaScript!\n\nCreate the game, give it a `div` to draw to, tell it when the keyboard is mashed and that's all you need to add Space Invaders to a website.\n\nThis is a simple learning exercise, so the JavaScript is deliberate kept all one file. There's no linting, testing, CI, or anything like that. If you want to see such patterns in front-end JavaScript, check out something like [angular-modal-service](https://github.com/dwmkerr/angular-modal-service).\n\n## Adding Space Invaders to a Web Page\n\nFirst, drop the `spaceinvaders.js` file into the website.\n\nNow add a canvas to the page.\n\n```html\n<canvas id=\"gameCanvas\"></canvas>\n```\n\nNext, add the Space Invaders game code. You create the game, initialise it with the canvas, start it and make sure you tell it when a key is pressed or released. That's it!\n\n```html\n<script>\n//  Setup the canvas.\nvar canvas = document.getElementById(\"gameCanvas\");\ncanvas.width = 800;\ncanvas.height = 600;\n\n//  Create the game.\nvar game = new Game();\n\n//  Initialise it with the game canvas.\ngame.initialise(canvas);\n\n//  Start the game.\ngame.start();\n\n//  Listen for keyboard events.\nvar pressedKeys = [];\nwindow.addEventListener(\"keydown\", function keydown(e) {\n  var keycode = window.event.keycode || e.which;\n    if(!pressedKeys[keycode])\n      pressedKeys[keycode] = true;\n    //  Supress further processing of left/right/space (37/29/32)\n    if(keycode == 37 || keycode == 39 || keycode == 32) {\n      e.preventDefault();\n    }\n    game.keyDown(keycode);\n});\nwindow.addEventListener(\"keyup\", function keydown(e) {\n  var keycode = window.event.keycode || e.which;\n    if(pressedKeys[keycode])\n      delete pressedKeys[keycode];\n    game.keyUp(keycode);\n});\n</script>\n```\n\n## References\n\nOther bits and pieces that are useful can be dropped here.\n\n- The sounds came from [http://www.classicgaming.cc/classics/spaceinvaders/sounds.php](http://www.classicgaming.cc/classics/spaceinvaders/sounds.php)\n\n## Publishing\n\nOn changes to the `master` branch, the GitHub Pages site will be automatically updated.\n"

Introduction to encoding/decoding text, basic idea of encryption.\n\n* [Chapter 5: Howler](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhOuww6rJJNNzo5zqtx0388myQkUKyrQz): Writing a Python program that can process input text either from the command line or from a file.The output prints either to STDOUT or to a file.  Learning about \"os.path.isfile\", how to \"open\" a file handle for reading/writing, how to read/write the contents of a file.\n\n* [Chapter 6: Word Count](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhOuww6rJJNOGPw5Mu5FyhnumZjb9F6kk): Writing a Python program to emulate the `wc` (word count) program. Validates and processes multiple file inputs as well as STDIN and creates output of the counts of lines, words, and bytes for each file optionally with a \"total\" if more than one file is provided.\n\n* [Chapter 7: Gashlycrumb](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhOuww6rJJNMxWy34-9jlD2ulZxaA7mxV): Writing a Python program that processes an input file to build a lookup table (dictionary) that is used with multiple positional arguments to translate to the values from the file.\n\n* [Chapter 8: Apples and Bananas](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhOuww6rJJNMe_qrKzw6jtxzHkTOszozs): Writing a Python program to find and replace elements in a string. Exploring multiple ways to write the same idea from for loops to list comprehensions to higher-order functions like map().\n\n* [Chapter 9: Abuse](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhOuww6rJJNOWShq53st6NjXacHHaJurn): Writing a Python program to generate Shakespearean insults by randomly combining some number of adjectives with a randomly chosen noun. Learning about randomness, seeds, testing, how to use triple-quoted strings.\n\n* [Chapter 10: Telephone](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhOuww6rJJNN0T5ZKUFuEDo3ykOs1zxPU): Using probabalistic and deterministc approaches to randomly mutating a string.\n\n* [Chapter 11: Bottles of Beer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhOuww6rJJNNGDXdGGfp3RDXBMhJwj0Ij): Writing a Python program to produce the verse to the \"99 Bottles of Beer\" song from a given starting point. Learning to count down, format strings, algorithm design. A focus on writing a function and unit test, exploring ways to incorporate our function to generate the verses from for loops to list comprehensions to map().\n\n* [Chapter 12: Ransom](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhOuww6rJJNMxWhckg7FO4cEx57WgHbd_): Writing a Python program that will randomly capitalize letters in a given piece of text for the nefarious purpose of creating a ransom note. Exploration of for loops, list comprehensions, and the map() function.\n\n* [Chapter 13: Twelve Days of Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhOuww6rJJNNZEMX12PE1OvSKy02UQoB4): Writing a Python program to create the verses for \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" from a given day. Learning how to write a function and the test for it, then using the function in a list comprehension and a map to generate the output.\n\n* [Chapter 14: The Rhymer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhOuww6rJJNPNn2qa5ATHJ0qd-JUgM_s0): Writing a Python program that can split off any initial consonants from a word and append a list of prefixes to create new rhyming \"words.\" Exploration of regular expressions to handle words with no initial consonants, with one or more leading consonants, and nothing but consonants. Writing a `stemmer()` function and the `test_stemmer()` function to understand it. Using list comprehensions with guard statements and how that relates to the `filter()` function.\n\n* [Chapter 15: The Kentucky Friar](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhOuww6rJJNMflxi3aRAQTqG7mvOXRObW): In this chapter we delve further into regular expressions, first learning how to split a string using a regex so we can separate things that look like \"words\" from non-words like punctuation and whitespace. Then we try to identify the word \"you\" (case-insensitive) to turn into \"y'all\" and any 2-syllable words ending in \"-ing\" so we can replace the final \"g\" with an apostrophe so that \"cooking\" becomes \"cookin'\" but \"swing\" would remain \"swing.\" We then apply this to an entire body of text to Kentucky fry the words with amusing results.\n\n* [Chapter 16: The Scrambler](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhOuww6rJJNPcLby3JXlKSo6duCIjh93S): Writing a Python program to find each \"word\" in a body of text and then scramble the letters such that the first and last letters remain in place, then reconstructing the text for output. Using regular expressions to split text, using `random.shuffle()` and understanding in-place mutation vs returning a new value. Comparing `for` loops to list comprehensions and the \"map()\" function.\n\n* [Chapter 17: Mad Libs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhOuww6rJJNPnNx_Emds00y2RX1Tbk59r): Writing a Python program to play the classic Mad Libs game. Reading an input file with placeholders for parts of speech like \"adjective\" or \"noun.\" Getting the inputs to replace those from the user interactively via the \"input()\" function or taking them from the command-line arguments. Using regular expressions to find and replace the placeholders. Learning about greedy regex and how to make them not greedy. Using the `re.findall()` and `re.sub()` functions. Using `sys.exit()` to prematurely exit a program with an error message/value.\n\n# Forking GitHub repo\n\nFirst use the GitHub interface to \"fork\" this repository into your own account.

Then it projects\nall those pixels to the screen using a _Lens_.  You can enable a _Rubix_\ngrid if you wish to visualize the mapping.  ([Quincuncial] projection shown below)\n\n[![map](readme-img/map.gif)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shaunlebron/blinky/master/readme-img/map.gif)\n\n__Try it:__ Blinky has shortcut keys for quickly trying several Globes and\nLenses.

So we provide lower poly globes as a way to balance quality and\nperformance.  Fewer renders means each view has to cover more area with less\nresolution.\n\n[![globes](readme-img/globes.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shaunlebron/blinky/master/readme-img/globes.jpg)\n\n## Technical Details\n\nBlinky is a modification of the famous __[Fisheye Quake]__.\n\n- adds a Lua scripting environment for defining:\n  - _Globes_ (for capturing the environment)\n  - _Lenses_ (for projecting a wide-angle image)\n- uses the cross-platform [TyrQuake] engine for Windows, Mac, and Linux\n\n### Building from source\n\nAfter some [manual setup](BUILDING.md) for your OS, you can build/play with:\n\n```\n$ ./build.sh\n$ ./play.sh\n```\n\n### Console Commands\n\nPress `~` to access the command console.  Use the `Tab` key for help completing\na partial command.\n\n```sh\nfisheye <0|1>     # enable/disable fisheye mode\nf_help            # show quick start options\nf_globe <name>    # choose a globe (affects picture quality and render speed)\nf_lens <name>     # choose a lens (affects the shape of your view)\n\nf_fov <degrees>   # zoom to a horizontal FOV\nf_vfov <degrees>  # zoom to a vertical FOV\nf_cover           # zoom in until screen is covered (some parts may be hidden)\nf_contain         # zoom out until screen contains the entire image (if possible)\n\nf_rubix           # display colored grid for each rendered view in the globe\nf_saveglobe       # take screenshots of each globe face (environment map)\n```\n\n### Lua Scripts\n\nTo create/edit globes and lenses, check out the following guides:\n\n- [Create a Globe](game/lua-scripts/globes)\n- [Create a Lens](game/lua-scripts/lenses)\n\n### Engine Code\n\n- [engine/NQ/fisheye.c](engine/NQ/fisheye.c) - new engine code\n- [engine patch](engine/fisheye.patch) - engine modifications\n\n## Theory of Projections\n\n[>> Interactive visualization for how projections work](http://shaunlebron.github.io/visualizing-projections)\n\n[![theory](readme-img/theory.png)](http://shaunlebron.github.io/visualizing-projections)\n\n## Future\n\nI hope to apply this to modern graphics using frame buffers for\nenvironment-capturing and pixel shaders for projection.  It would be\ninteresting to see its impact on performance.\n\nIf this modern method is performant enough, I think Panini/Stereographic could\neasily become a standard for gamers demanding wide-angle video.  But if it is\nnot performant enough for live applications, I think it could still prove\nuseful in post-processed videos using something like [WolfCam].  For example,\nspectators could benefit from wide-angle viewings of previously recorded\ncompetitive matches or even [artistic montages][f33l].\n\n## Thanks\n\nThis project would not exist without these people!\n\n- __Wouter van Oortmerssen__ for creating & open-sourcing [Fisheye Quake]\n- __Peter Weiden__ for creating [fisheye diagrams] on Wikipedia\n- __Kevin Shanahan__ for creating/maintaining a cross-platform Quake engine, [TyrQuake]\n\n## Contact\n\n- email: <shaun.e.williams@gmail.com>\n- twitter: [@shaunlebron](http://twitter.com/shaunlebron)\n\n## License\n\n- The [Lua scripts](game/lua-scripts) and [fisheye.c](engine/NQ/fisheye.c) are released under the MIT license.\n- TyrQuake is released under GPL-2.\n\n\n[Fisheye Quake]:http://strlen.com/gfxengine/fisheyequake/\n[TyrQuake]:http://disenchant.net/tyrquake/\n[Panini]: http://tksharpless.net/vedutismo/Pannini/\n[Quincuncial]:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peirce_quincuncial_projection\n[f33l]:https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5483f2\n[WolfCam]:https://github.com/brugal/wolfcamql\n[fisheye diagrams]:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisheye_lens#Mapping_function\n"

It means that it helps you to display, animate and manage\ninteractive graphics so that it's easy for you to make games and\napplications using\nJavaScript and other HTML5 technologies. It has a sensible,\nuncluttered API and includes many useful features, like supporting\ntexture atlases and providing a streamlined system for animating\nsprites (interactive images). It also gives you a complete scene graph so that you can\ncreate hierarchies of nested sprites (sprites inside sprites), as well\nas letting you attach mouse and touch events directly to sprites. And,\nmost\nimportantly, Pixi gets out of your way so that you can use as much or\nas little of it as you want to, adapt it to your personal coding\nstyle, and integrate it seamlessly with other useful frameworks.\n\nPixi\u2019s API is actually a refinement of a well-worn and battle-tested\nAPI pioneered by Macromedia/Adobe Flash. Old-skool Flash developers\nwill feel right at home. Other current sprite rendering frameworks use\na similar API: CreateJS, Starling, Sparrow and Apple\u2019s SpriteKit. The\nstrength of Pixi\u2019s API is that it\u2019s general-purpose: it\u2019s not a game\nengine. That\u2019s good because it gives you total expressive freedom to make anything you like, and wrap your own custom game engine around it.\n\nIn this tutorial you\u2019re going to find out how to combine Pixi\u2019s\npowerful image rendering features and scene graph to start making\ngames. But Pixi isn't just for games - you can use these same\ntechniques to create any interactive media applications. That means\napps for phones!\n\nWhat do you need to know before you get started with this tutorial?\n\nYou should have a reasonable understanding of HTML and\nJavaScript. You don't have to be an expert, just an ambitious beginner\nwith an eagerness to learn. If you don't know HTML and JavaScript, the\nbest place to start learning it is this book:\n\n[Foundation Game Design with HTML5 and JavaScript](http://www.apress.com/9781430247166)\n\nI know for a fact that it's the best book, because I wrote it!\n\nThere are also some good internet resources to help get you started:\n\n[Khan Academy: Computer\nProgramming](http://www.khanacademy.org/computing/cs)\n\n[Code Academy:\nJavaScript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)\n\nChoose whichever best suits your learning style.\n\nOk, got it?\nDo you know what JavaScript variables, functions, arrays and objects are and how to\nuse them? Do you know what [JSON data\nfiles](http://www.copterlabs.com/blog/json-what-it-is-how-it-works-how-to-use-it/)\nare? Have you used the [Canvas Drawing API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Drawing_graphics_with_canvas)?\n\nTo use Pixi, you'll also need to run a webserver in your root project\ndirectory. Do you know what a webserver is and\nhow to launch one in your project folder? The best way is to use\n[node.js](http://nodejs.org) and then to install the extremely easy to use\n[http-server](https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server). However, you need to be comfortable working with the Unix\ncommand line if you want to do that. You can learn how to use\nUnix [in this\nvideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=cX9ASUE3YAQ)\nand, when you're finished, follow it with [this\nvideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INk0ATBbclc). You should learn\nhow to use Unix - it only takes a couple of hours to learn and is a\nreally fun and easy way to interact with your computer.\n\nBut if you don't want to mess around with the command line just yet, try the [Mongoose](http://cesanta.com/)\nwebserver:\n\nOr, just write all your code using the excellent [Brackets text\neditor](http://brackets.io). Brackets automatically launches a webserver\nand browser for you when you click the lightning bolt button in its\nmain workspace.\n\nNow if you think you're ready, read on!\n\n(Request to readers: this is a *living document*. If you have any\nquestions about specific details or need any of the content clarified, please\ncreate an **issue** in this GitHub repository and I'll update the text\nwith more information.)\n\n<a id='settingup'></a>\nSetting up\n----------\n\nBefore you start writing any code, create a folder for your project, and launch a\nwebserver in the project's root directory. If you aren't running a\nwebserver, Pixi won't work.\n\nNext, you need to install Pixi. \n\n<a id='installingpixi'></a>\n### Installing Pixi\n\nThe version used for this introduction is **v5.3.10**\nand you can find the `pixi.min.js` file either in this repository's `pixi` folder or on [Pixi's release page for v5.3.10](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/releases/tag/v5.3.10).\nOr, you can get the latest version from [Pixi's main release page](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/releases).\n\nThis one file is all you need to use Pixi. You can ignore all the\nother files in the repository: **you don't need them.**\n\nNext, create a basic HTML page, and use a\n`<script>` tag to link the\n`pixi.min.js` file that you've just downloaded. The `<script>` tag's `src`\nshould be relative to your root directory where your webserver is\nrunning. Your `<script>` tag might look something like this:\n```html\n<script src=\"pixi.min.js\"></script>\n```\nHere's a basic HTML page that you could use to link Pixi and test that\nit's working. (This assumes that the `pixi.min.js` is in a subfolder called `pixi`):\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n  <title>Hello World</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <script src=\"pixi/pixi.min.js\"></script>\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    let type = \"WebGL\";\n    if (!PIXI.utils.isWebGLSupported()) {\n      type = \"canvas\";\n    }\n\n    PIXI.utils.sayHello(type);\n  </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIf Pixi is linking correctly,\nsomething like this will be displayed in your web browser's JavaScript console by default:\n```\n      PixiJS 5.3.10 - * WebGL * http://www.pixijs.com/  \u2665\u2665\u2665 \n```\n\n\n<a id='application'></a>\nCreating the Pixi Application and `stage`\n-------------------------------\n\nNow you can start using Pixi!\n\nBut how? \n\nThe first step is to create a rectangular\ndisplay area that you can start displaying images on. Pixi has an\n`Application` object that creates this for you. It\nautomatically generates an HTML `<canvas>` element and figures out how\nto display your images on the canvas. You then need to create a\nspecial Pixi `Container` object called the `stage`. As you'll see\nahead, this `stage` object is going to be used as the root container\nthat holds all the things you want Pixi to display. \n\nHere\u2019s the code you need to write to create an `app` Pixi Application\nand `stage`. Add this code to your HTML document between the `<script>` tags:\n```js\n//Create a Pixi Application\nconst app = new PIXI.Application({width: 256, height: 256});\n\n//Add the canvas that Pixi automatically created for you to the HTML document\ndocument.body.appendChild(app.view);\n```\nThis is the most basic code you need write to get started using Pixi. \nIt produces a black 256 pixel by 256 pixel canvas element and adds it to your\nHTML document. Here's what this looks like in a browser when you run this code.\n\n![Basic display](/examples/images/screenshots/01.png)\n\nYay, a [black square](http://rampantgames.com/blog/?p=7745)!\n\n`PIXI.Application`'s only argument is a single object called the `options` object. In this example its `width` and `height` properties are set to determine the width and height of the canvas, in pixels. You can set many more optional properties inside this `options` object; here's how you could use it to set anti-aliasing, transparency\nand resolution:\n```js\nconst app = new PIXI.Application({ \n    width: 256,         // default: 800\n    height: 256,        // default: 600\n    antialias: true,    // default: false\n    transparent: false, // default: false\n    resolution: 1       // default: 1\n  }\n);\n```\nIf you're happy with Pixi's default settings, you don't need to set any of these options.\nBut, if you need to, see Pixi's documentation on [PIXI.Application](https://pixijs.download/v5.3.10/docs/PIXI.Application.html).\n\nWhat do those options do?\n`antialias` smoothes the edges of fonts and graphic primitives. (WebGL\nanti-aliasing isn\u2019t available on all platforms, so you\u2019ll need to test\nthis on your game\u2019s target platform.) `transparent` makes the canvas\nbackground transparent. `resolution` makes it easier to work with\ndisplays of varying resolutions and pixel densities. Setting\nthe resolutions is a little\noutside the scope of this tutorial, but check out [Mat Grove's\nexplanation](https://web.archive.org/web/20171203090730/http://www.goodboydigital.com/pixi-js-v2-fastest-2d-webgl-renderer/)\nabout how to use `resolution` for all the details. But usually, just keep `resolution`\nat 1 for most projects and you'll be fine. \n\nPixi's `renderer` object will default to WebGL, which is good, because WebGL is\nincredibly fast, and lets you use some spectacular visual effects that\nyou\u2019ll learn all about ahead. The Canvas renderer was removed in version 5 and above, but Pixi provides a separate version named `pixi.js-legacy` which re-adds support for the canvas renderer should you need it.\n\nIf you need to change the background color of the canvas after you\u2019ve\ncreated it, set the `app.renderer` object\u2019s `backgroundColor` property to\nany hexadecimal color value:\n```js\napp.renderer.backgroundColor = 0x061639;\n```\nIf you want to find the width or the height of the `renderer`, use\n`app.renderer.view.width` and `app.renderer.view.height`.\n\nTo change the size of the canvas, use the `renderer`\u2019s `resize`\nmethod, and supply any new `width` and `height` values. But, to make\nsure the canvas is resized to match the resolution, set `autoDensity`\nto `true`.\n```js\napp.renderer.autoDensity = true;\napp.renderer.resize(512, 512);\n```\nIf you want to make the canvas fill the entire window and adjust automatically if it is resized, you can use some CSS styling along with the `resizeTo` property, providing it an element to scale to, such as `window` as the value.\n`resizeTo` can also be passed with the rest of your options when creating your Pixi application.\n```js\napp.renderer.view.style.position = \"absolute\";\napp.renderer.view.style.display = \"block\";\napp.renderer.autoDensity = true;\napp.resizeTo = window;\n```\nBut, if you do that, make sure you also set the default padding and\nmargins to 0 on all your HTML elements with this bit of CSS code:\n```html\n<style>* {padding: 0; margin: 0}</style>\n```\n(The asterisk, *, in the code above, is the CSS \"universal selector\",\nwhich just means \"all the tags in the HTML document\".)\n\nIf you want the canvas to scale proportionally to any browser window\nsize, you can use [this custom `scaleToWindow` function](https://github.com/kittykatattack/scaleToWindow).\n\n<a id='sprites'></a>\nPixi sprites\n------------\n\nNow that you have a renderer, you can start adding images to it. Anything you want to be made visible in the renderer has to be added to a special Pixi object called the `stage`. You can access this special `stage` object like this:\n```js\napp.stage\n```\nThe `stage` is a Pixi `Container` object. You can think of a container\nas a kind of empty box that will group together and store whatever you\nput inside it. The `stage` object is the root container for all the visible\nthings in your scene. Whatever you put inside the `stage` will be\nrendered on the canvas. Right now the `stage` is empty, but soon we're going to\nstart putting things inside it. (You can read more about Pixi's `Container` objects [here](http://pixijs.download/v5.3.10/docs/PIXI.Container.html)).\n\n(Important: because the `stage` is a Pixi `Container` it has the same properties and methods as any other `Container` object. But, although the `stage` has `width` and `height` properties, *they don't refer to\nthe size of the rendering window*. The stage's `width` and `height`\nproperties just tell you the area occupied by the things you put inside it - more on that ahead!)\n\nSo what do you put on the stage? Special image objects called\n**sprites**. Sprites are basically just images that you can control\nwith code. You can control their position, size, and a host of other\nproperties that are useful for making interactive and animated graphics. Learning to make and control sprites is really the most\nimportant thing about learning to use Pixi. If you know how to make\nsprites and add them to the stage, you're just a small step away from\nstarting to make games.\n\nPixi has a `Sprite` class that is a versatile way to make game\nsprites. There are three main ways to create them:\n\n- From a single image file.\n- From a sub-image on a **tileset**. A tileset is a single, big image that\nincludes all the images you'll need in your game.\n- From a **texture atlas** (A JSON file that defines the size and position of an image on a tileset.)\n\nYou\u2019re going to learn all three ways, but, before you do, let\u2019s find\nout what you need to know about images before you can display them\nwith Pixi.\n\n<a id='loading'></a>\nLoading images into the texture cache\n-------------------------------------\n\nBecause Pixi renders the image on the GPU with WebGL, the image needs\nto be in a format that the GPU can process. A WebGL-ready image is\ncalled a **texture**. Before you can make a sprite display an image,\nyou need to convert an ordinary image file into a WebGL texture. To\nkeep everything working fast and efficiently under the hood, Pixi uses\na **texture cache** to store and reference all the textures your\nsprites will need. The names of the textures are strings that match\nthe file locations of the images they refer to. That means if you have\na texture that was loaded from `\"images/cat.png\"`, you could find it in the texture cache like this:\n```js\nPIXI.utils.TextureCache[\"images/cat.png\"];\n```\nThe textures are stored in a WebGL compatible format that\u2019s efficient\nfor Pixi\u2019s renderer to work with. You can then use Pixi\u2019s `Sprite` class to make a new sprite using the texture.\n```js\nconst texture = PIXI.utils.TextureCache[\"images/anySpriteImage.png\"];\nconst sprite = new PIXI.Sprite(texture);\n```\nBut how do you load the image file and convert it into a texture? Use\nPixi\u2019s built-in `Loader` object. \n\nPixi's powerful `Loader` object is all you need to load any kind of image. \nHere\u2019s how to use it to load an image and call a function called `setup` when the image has finished loading:\n```js\nPIXI.Loader.shared\n  .add(\"images/anyImage.png\")\n  .load(setup);\n\nfunction setup() {\n  //This code will run when the loader has finished loading the image\n}\n```\n[Pixi\u2019s development team\nrecommends](http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/16019-preload-all-textures/?p=90907)\nthat if you use the loader, you should create the sprite by\nreferencing the texture in the `Loader`\u2019s `resources` object, like this:\n```js\nconst sprite = new PIXI.Sprite(\n  PIXI.Loader.shared.resources[\"images/anyImage.png\"].texture\n);\n```\nHere\u2019s an example of some complete code you could write to load an image, \ncall the `setup` function, and create a sprite from the loaded image:\n```js\nPIXI.Loader.shared\n  .add(\"images/anyImage.png\")\n  .load(setup);\n\nfunction setup() {\n  const sprite = new PIXI.Sprite(\n    PIXI.Loader.shared.resources[\"images/anyImage.png\"].texture\n  );\n}\n```\nThis is the general format we\u2019ll be using to load images and create\nsprites in this tutorial.\n\nYou can load multiple images at the same time by listing them with\nchainable `add` methods, like this:\n```js\nPIXI.Loader.shared\n  .add(\"images/imageOne.png\")\n  .add(\"images/imageTwo.png\")\n  .add(\"images/imageThree.png\")\n  .load(setup);\n```\nBetter yet, just list all the files you want to load in\nan array inside a single `add` method, like this:\n```js\nPIXI.Loader.shared\n  .add([\n    \"images/imageOne.png\",\n    \"images/imageTwo.png\",\n    \"images/imageThree.png\"\n  ])\n  .load(setup);\n```\nThe `Loader` also lets you load JSON files, which you'll learn\nabout ahead.\n\n<a id='displaying'></a>\nDisplaying sprites\n------------------\n\nAfter you've loaded an image, and used it to make a sprite, you need to add the sprite to Pixi's `stage` with the `stage.addChild` method, like this:\n```js\napp.stage.addChild(cat);\n```\nRemember that the `stage` is the main container that holds all of your sprites.\n\n**Important: you won't be able to see any of your sprites unless you add them to the `stage`!**\n\nBefore we continue, let's look at a practical example of how to use what\nyou've just learnt to display a single image. In the `examples/images`\nfolder you'll find a 64 by 64 pixel PNG image of a cat.\n\n![Basic display](/examples/images/cat.png)\n\nHere's all the JavaScript code you need to load the image, create a\nsprite, and display it on Pixi's stage:\n```js\n//Create a Pixi Application\nconst app = new PIXI.Application({ \n    width: 256, \n    height: 256,                       \n    antialias: true, \n    transparent: false, \n    resolution: 1\n  }\n);\n\n//Add the canvas that Pixi automatically created for you to the HTML document\ndocument.body.appendChild(app.view);\n\n//load an image and run the `setup` function when it's done\nPIXI.Loader.shared\n  .add(\"images/cat.png\")\n  .load(setup);\n\n//This `setup` function will run when the image has loaded\nfunction setup() {\n\n  //Create the cat sprite\n  const cat = new PIXI.Sprite(PIXI.Loader.shared.resources[\"images/cat.png\"].texture);\n  \n  //Add the cat to the stage\n  app.stage.addChild(cat);\n}\n```\nWhen this code runs, here's what you'll see:\n\n![Cat on the stage](/examples/images/screenshots/02.png)\n\nNow we're getting somewhere!\n\nIf you ever need to remove a sprite from the stage, use the `removeChild` method:\n```js\napp.stage.removeChild(anySprite);\n```\nBut usually setting a sprite\u2019s `visible` property to `false` will be a simpler and more efficient way of making sprites disappear.\n```js\nanySprite.visible = false;\n```\n<a id='usingaliases'></a>\n### Using aliases\n\nYou can save yourself a little typing and make your code more readable\nby creating short-form aliases for the Pixi objects and methods that you\nuse frequently. For example, is prefixing `PIXI` to all of Pixi's objects starting to bog you down? If you think so, create a shorter alias that points to it. For example, here's how you can create an alias to the `TextureCache` object:\n```js\nconst TextureCache = PIXI.utils.TextureCache;\n```\nThen, use that alias in place of the original, like this:\n```js\nconst texture = TextureCache[\"images/cat.png\"];\n```\nIn addition to letting you write slightly more succinct code, using aliases has\nan extra benefit: it helps to buffer you from Pixi's frequently\nchanging API. If Pixi's API changes in future\nversions - which it will! - you just need to update these aliases to\nPixi objects and methods in one place, at the beginning of\nyour program, instead of every instance where they're used throughout\nyour code. So when Pixi's development team decides they want to\nrearrange the furniture a bit, you'll be one step ahead of them!\n\nTo see how to do this, let's re-write the code we wrote to load an image and display it,\nusing aliases for all the Pixi objects and methods.\n```js\n//Aliases\nconst Application = PIXI.Application,\n    loader = PIXI.Loader.shared,\n    resources = PIXI.Loader.shared.resources,\n    Sprite = PIXI.Sprite;\n\n//Create a Pixi Application\nconst app = new Application({ \n    width: 256, \n    height: 256,                       \n    antialias: true, \n    transparent: false, \n    resolution: 1\n  }\n);\n\n//Add the canvas that Pixi automatically created for you to the HTML document\ndocument.body.appendChild(app.view);\n\n//load an image and run the `setup` function when it's done\nloader\n  .add(\"images/cat.png\")\n  .load(setup);\n\n//This `setup` function will run when the image has loaded\nfunction setup() {\n\n  //Create the cat sprite\n  const cat = new Sprite(resources[\"images/cat.png\"].texture);\n  \n  //Add the cat to the stage\n  app.stage.addChild(cat);\n}\n\n```\nMost of the examples in this tutorial will use aliases for Pixi\nobjects that follow this same model. **Unless otherwise stated, you can\nassume that all the code examples that follow use aliases like these**.\n\nThis is all you need to know to start loading images and creating\nsprites.\n\n<a id='alittlemoreaboutloadingthings'></a>\n### A little more about loading things\n\nThe format I've shown you above is what I suggest you use as your\nstandard template for loading images and displaying sprites. So, you\ncan safely ignore the next few paragraphs and jump straight to the\nnext section, \"Positioning sprites.\" But Pixi's `Loader` object is\nquite sophisticated and includes a few features that you should be\naware of, even if you don't use them on a regular basis. Let's\nlook at some of the most useful.\n\n<a id='makeaspritefromanordinaryjavascriptimageobject'></a>\n#### Make a sprite from an ordinary JavaScript Image object or Canvas\n\nFor optimization and efficiency it\u2019s always best to make a sprite from\na texture that\u2019s been pre-loaded into Pixi\u2019s texture cache. But if for\nsome reason you need to make a texture from a regular JavaScript\n`Image`\nobject, you can do that using Pixi\u2019s `BaseTexture` and `Texture`\nclasses:\n```js\nconst base = new PIXI.BaseTexture(anyImageObject),\n    texture = new PIXI.Texture(base),\n    sprite = new PIXI.Sprite(texture);\n```\nYou can use `BaseTexture.from` if you want to make a texture\nfrom any existing canvas element:\n```js\nconst base = new PIXI.BaseTexture.from(anyCanvasElement);\n```\nIf you want to change the texture the sprite is displaying, use the\n`texture` property. Set it to any `Texture` object, like this:\n```js\nanySprite.texture = PIXI.utils.TextureCache[\"anyTexture.png\"];\n```\nYou can use this technique to interactively change the sprite\u2019s\nappearance if something significant happens to it in the game.\n\n<a id='assigninganametoaloadingfile'></a>\n#### Assigning a name to a loading file\n\nIt's possible to assign a unique name to each resource you want to\nload. Just supply the name (a string) as the first argument in the\n`add` method. For example, here's how to name an image of a cat as\n`catImage`.\n```js\nPIXI.Loader.shared\n  .add(\"catImage\", \"images/cat.png\")\n  .load(setup);\n```\nThis creates an object called `catImage` in `Loader.shared.resources`.\nThat means you can create a sprite by referencing the `catImage` object, like this:\n```js\nconst cat = new PIXI.Sprite(PIXI.Loader.shared.resources.catImage.texture);\n```\nHowever, I recommend you don't use this feature! That's because you'll\nhave to remember all names you gave each loaded files, as well as make sure\nyou don't accidentally use the same name more than once. Using the file path name, as we've done in previous examples is simpler and less error prone.\n\n<a id='monitoringloadprogress'></a>\n#### Monitoring load progress\n\nPixi's `Loader` has a special `progress` event that will call a\ncustomizable function that will run each time a file loads. `progress` events are called by the\n`Loader`'s `onProgress` method, like this:\n```js\nPIXI.Loader.shared.onProgress.add(loadProgressHandler);\n```\n\nHere's how to include the `onProgress` method in the loading chain, and call\na user-definable function called `loadProgressHandler` each time a file loads.\n```js\nPIXI.Loader.shared.onProgress.add(loadProgressHandler)\nPIXI.Loader.shared\n  .add([\n    \"images/one.png\",\n    \"images/two.png\",\n    \"images/three.png\"\n  ])\n  .load(setup);\n\nfunction loadProgressHandler() {\n  console.log(\"loading\"); \n}\n\nfunction setup() {\n  console.log(\"setup\");\n}\n```\nEach time one of the files loads, the progress event calls\n`loadProgressHandler` to display \"loading\" in the console. When all three files have loaded, the `setup`\nfunction will run. Here's the output of the above code in the console:\n```js\nloading\nloading\nloading\nsetup\n```\nThat's neat, but it gets better. You can also find out exactly which file\nhas loaded and what percentage of overall files are have currently\nloaded. You can do this by adding optional `loader` and\n`resource` parameters to the `loadProgressHandler`, like this:\n```js\nfunction loadProgressHandler(loader, resource) { /*...*/ }\n```\nYou can then use `resource.url` to find the file that's currently\nloaded. (Use `resource.name` if you want to find the optional name\nthat you might have assigned to the file, as the first argument in the\n`add` method.) And you can use `loader.progress` to find what\npercentage of total resources have currently loaded. Here's some code\nthat does just that.\n```js\nPIXI.Loader.shared.onProgress.add(loadProgressHandler);\nPIXI.Loader.shared\n  .add([\n    \"images/one.png\",\n    \"images/two.png\",\n    \"images/three.png\"\n  ])\n  .load(setup);\n\nfunction loadProgressHandler(loader, resource) {\n\n  //Display the file `url` currently being loaded\n  console.log(\"loading: \" + resource.url); \n\n  //Display the percentage of files currently loaded\n  console.log(\"progress: \" + loader.progress + \"%\"); \n\n  //If you gave your files names as the first argument \n  //of the `add` method, you can access them like this\n  //console.log(\"loading: \" + resource.name);\n}\n\nfunction setup() {\n  console.log(\"All files loaded\");\n}\n```\nHere's what this code will display in the console when it runs:\n```js\nloading: images/one.png\nprogress: 33.333333333333336%\nloading: images/two.png\nprogress: 66.66666666666667%\nloading: images/three.png\nprogress: 100%\nAll files loaded\n```\nThat's really cool, because you could use this as the basis for\ncreating a loading progress bar. \n\n(Note: There are additional properties you can access on the\n`resource` object. `resource.error` will tell you of any possible\nerror that happened while\ntrying to load a file. `resource.data` lets you\naccess the file's raw binary data.)\n\n<a id='moreaboutpixisloader'></a>\n#### More about Pixi's Loader\n\nPixi's `Loader` is ridiculously feature-rich and configurable. Let's\ntake a quick bird's-eye view of its usage to\nget you started.\n\nThe loader's chainable `add` method takes 4 basic arguments:\n```js\nadd(name, url, optionObject, callbackFunction);\n```\nHere's what the loader's source code documentation has to say about\nthese parameters:\n\n`name` (string): The name of the resource to load. If it's not passed, the `url` is used.  \n`url` (string): The url for this resource, relative to the `baseUrl` of the loader.  \n`options` (object literal): The options for the load.  \n`options.crossOrigin` (Boolean): Is the request cross-origin? The default is to determine automatically.  \n`options.loadType`: How should the resource be loaded? The default value is `Resource.LOAD_TYPE.XHR`.  \n`options.xhrType`: How should the data being loaded be interpreted\nwhen using XHR? The default value is `Resource.XHR_RESPONSE_TYPE.DEFAULT`  \n`callbackFunction`: The function to call when this specific resource completes loading.\n\nThe only one of these arguments that's required is the `url` (the file that you want to load.) \n\nHere are some examples of some ways you could use the `add`\nmethod to load files. These first ones are what the docs call the loader's \"normal syntax\":\n```js\n.add('key', 'http://...', function () {})\n.add('http://...', function () {})\n.add('http://...')\n```\nAnd these are examples of the loader's \"object syntax\":\n```js\n.add({\n  name: 'key2',\n  url: 'http://...'\n}, function () {})\n\n.add({\n  url: 'http://...'\n}, function () {})\n\n.add({\n  name: 'key3',\n  url: 'http://...',\n  onComplete: function () {}\n})\n\n.add({\n  url: 'https://...',\n  onComplete: function () {},\n  crossOrigin: true\n})\n```\nYou can also pass the `add` method an array of objects, or urls, or\nboth:\n```js\n.add([\n  {\n    name: 'key4',\n    url: 'http://...',\n    onComplete: function () {}\n  },\n  {\n    url: 'http://...',\n    onComplete: function () {}\n  },\n  'http://...'\n]);\n```\n(Note: If you ever need to reset the loader to load a new batch of files, call the loader's `reset` method: `PIXI.Loader.shared.reset();`)\n\nPixi's `Loader` has many more advanced features, including options to\nlet you load and parse binary files of all types. This is not\nsomething you'll need to do on a day-to-day basis, and way outside the\nscope of this tutorial, so [make sure to check out the loader's GitHub repository\nfor more information](https://github.com/englercj/resource-loader).\n\n<a id='positioning'></a>\nPositioning sprites\n-------------------\n\nNow that you know how to create and display sprites, let's find out\nhow to position and resize them.\n\nIn the earlier example the cat sprite was added to the stage at\nthe top left corner. The cat has an `x` position of\n0 and a `y` position of 0. You can change the position of the cat by\nchanging the values of its `x` and `y` properties. Here's how you can center the cat in the stage by\nsetting its `x` and `y` property values to 96.\n```js\ncat.x = 96;\ncat.y = 96;\n```\nAdd these two lines of code anywhere inside the `setup`\nfunction, after you've created the sprite. \n```js\nfunction setup() {\n\n  //Create the `cat` sprite\n  const cat = new Sprite(resources[\"images/cat.png\"].texture);\n\n  //Change the sprite's position\n  cat.x = 96;\n  cat.y = 96;\n\n  //Add the cat to the stage so you can see it\n  app.stage.addChild(cat);\n}\n```\n(Note: In this example,\n`Sprite` is an alias for `PIXI.Sprite`, `TextureCache` is an\nalias for `PIXI.utils.TextureCache`, and `resources` is an alias for\n`PIXI.Loader.shared.resources` as described earlier. I'll be\nusing aliases that follow this same format for all Pixi objects and\nmethods in the example code from now on.)\n\nThese two new lines of code will move the cat 96 pixels to the right,\nand 96 pixels down. Here's the result:\n\n![Cat centered on the stage](/examples/images/screenshots/03.png)\n\nThe cat's top left corner (its left ear) represents its `x` and `y`\nanchor point. To make the cat move to the right, increase the\nvalue of its `x` property. To make the cat move down, increase the\nvalue of its `y` property. If the cat has an `x` value of 0, it will be at\nthe very left side of the stage. If it has a `y` value of 0, it will\nbe at the very top of the stage.\n\n![Cat centered on the stage - diagram](/examples/images/screenshots/04.png)\n\nInstead of setting the sprite's `x` and `y` properties independently,\nyou can set them together in a single line of code, like this:\n```js\nsprite.position.set(x, y);\n```\n<a id='sizenscale'></a>\nSize and scale\n--------------\n\nYou can change a sprite's size by setting its `width` and `height`\nproperties. Here's how to give the cat a `width` of 80 pixels and a `height` of\n120 pixels.\n```js\ncat.width = 80;\ncat.height = 120;\n```\nAdd those two lines of code to the `setup` function, like this:\n```js\nfunction setup() {\n\n  //Create the `cat` sprite\n  const cat = new Sprite(resources[\"images/cat.png\"].texture);\n\n  //Change the sprite's position\n  cat.x = 96;\n  cat.y = 96;\n\n  //Change the sprite's size\n  cat.width = 80;\n  cat.height = 120;\n\n  //Add the cat to the stage so you can see it\n  app.stage.addChild(cat);\n}\n```\nHere's the result:\n\n![Cat's height and width changed](/examples/images/screenshots/05.png)\n\nYou can see that the cat's position (its top left corner) didn't\nchange, only its width and height.\n\n![Cat's height and width changed - diagram](/examples/images/screenshots/06.png)\n\nSprites also have `scale.x` and `scale.y` properties that change the\nsprite's width and height proportionately. Here's how to set the cat's\nscale to half size:\n```js\ncat.scale.x = 0.5;\ncat.scale.y = 0.5;\n```\nScale values are numbers between 0 and 1 that represent a\npercentage of the sprite's size. 1 means 100% (full size), while\n0.5 means 50% (half size). You can double the sprite's size by setting\nits scale values to 2, like this:\n```js\ncat.scale.x = 2;\ncat.scale.y = 2;\n```\nPixi has an alternative, concise way for you set sprite's scale in one\nline of code using the `scale.set` method.\n```js\ncat.scale.set(0.5, 0.5);\n```\nIf that appeals to you, use it!\n\n<a id='rotation'></a>\nRotation\n--------\n\nYou can make a sprite rotate by setting its `rotation` property to a\nvalue in [radians](http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/radians.html).\n```js\ncat.rotation = 0.5;\n```\nBut around which point does that rotation happen?\n\nYou've seen that a sprite's top left corner represents its `x` and `y` position. That point is\ncalled the **anchor point**. If you set the sprite\u2019s `rotation`\nproperty to something like `0.5`, the rotation will happen *around the\nsprite\u2019s anchor point*.\nThis diagram shows what effect this will have on our cat sprite.\n\n![Rotation around anchor point - diagram](/examples/images/screenshots/07.png)\n\nYou can see that the anchor point, the cat\u2019s left ear, is the center of the imaginary circle around which the cat is rotating.\nWhat if you want the sprite to rotate around its center? Change the\nsprite\u2019s `anchor` point so that it\u2019s centered inside the sprite, like\nthis:\n```js\ncat.anchor.x = 0.5;\ncat.anchor.y = 0.5;\n```\nThe `anchor.x` and `anchor.y` values represent a percentage of the texture\u2019s dimensions, from 0 to 1 (0%\nto 100%). Setting it to 0.5 centers the texture over the point. The location of the point\nitself won\u2019t change, just the way the texture is positioned over it.\n\nThis next diagram shows what happens to the rotated sprite if you center its anchor point.\n\n![Rotation around centered anchor point - diagram](/examples/images/screenshots/08.png)\n\nYou can see that the sprite\u2019s texture shifts up and to the left. This\nis an important side-effect to remember!\n\nJust like with `position` and `scale`, you can set the anchor\u2019s x and\ny values with one line of code like this:\n```js\ncat.anchor.set(x, y);\n```\nSprites also have a `pivot` property which works in a similar way to\n`anchor`. `pivot` sets the position\nof the sprite's x/y origin point. If you change the pivot point and\nthen rotate the sprite, it will\nrotate around that origin point. For example, the following code will\nset the sprite's `pivot.x` point to 32, and its `pivot.y` point to 32\n```js\ncat.pivot.set(32, 32);\n```\nAssuming that the sprite is 64x64 pixels, the sprite will now rotate\naround its center point. But remember: if you change a sprite's pivot\npoint, you've also changed its x/y origin point. \n\nSo, what's the difference between `anchor` and `pivot`? They're really\nsimilar! `anchor` shifts the origin point of the sprite's image texture, using a 0 to 1 normalized value.\n`pivot` shifts the origin of the sprite's x and y point, using pixel\nvalues. Which should you use? It's up to you. Just play around\nwith both of them and see which you prefer.\n\n<a id='tileset'></a>\nMake a sprite from a tileset sub-image\n--------------------------------------\n\nYou now know how to make a sprite from a single image file. But, as a\ngame designer, you\u2019ll usually be making your sprites using\n**tilesets** (also known as **spritesheets**.) Pixi has some convenient built-in ways to help you do this.\nA tileset is a single image file that contains sub-images. The sub-images\nrepresent all the graphics you want to use in your game. Here's an\nexample of a tileset image that contains game characters and game\nobjects as sub-images.\n\n![An example tileset](/examples/images/screenshots/09.png)\n\nThe entire tileset is 192 by 192 pixels. Each image is in its own 32 by 32\npixel grid cell. Storing and accessing all your game graphics on a\ntileset is a very\nprocessor and memory efficient way to work with graphics, and Pixi is\noptimized for this.\n\nYou can capture a sub-image from a tileset by defining a rectangular\narea\nthat's the same size and position as the sub-image you want to\nextract. Here's an example of the rocket sub-image that\u2019s been extracted from\nthe tileset.\n\n![Rocket extracted from tileset](/examples/images/screenshots/10.png)\n\nLet's look at the code that does this. First, load the `tileset.png` image\nwith Pixi\u2019s `Loader`, just as you've done in earlier examples.\n```js\nloader\n  .add(\"images/tileset.png\")\n  .load(setup);\n```\nNext, when the image has loaded, use a rectangular sub-section of the tileset to create the\nsprite\u2019s image. Here's the code that extracts the sub image, creates\nthe rocket sprite, and positions and displays it on the canvas.\n```js\nfunction setup() {\n\n  //Create the `tileset` sprite from the texture\n  const texture = TextureCache[\"images/tileset.png\"];\n\n  //Create a rectangle object that defines the position and\n  //size of the sub-image you want to extract from the texture\n  //(`Rectangle` is an alias for `PIXI.Rectangle`)\n  const rectangle = new Rectangle(192, 128, 64, 64);\n\n  //Tell the texture to use that rectangular section\n  texture.frame = rectangle;\n\n  //Create the sprite from the texture\n  const rocket = new Sprite(texture);\n\n  //Position the rocket sprite on the canvas\n  rocket.x = 32;\n  rocket.y = 32;\n\n  //Add the rocket to the stage\n  app.stage.addChild(rocket);\n  \n  //Render the stage   \n  app.renderer.render(app.stage);\n}\n```\nHow does this work?\n\nPixi has a built-in `Rectangle` object (`PIXI.Rectangle`) that is a general-purpose\nobject for defining rectangular shapes. It takes four arguments. The\nfirst two arguments define the rectangle's `x` and `y` position. The\nlast two define its `width` and `height`. Here's the format\nfor defining a new `Rectangle` object.\n```js\nconst rectangle = new Rectangle(x, y, width, height);\n```\nThe rectangle object is just a *data object*; it's up to you to decide how you want to use it. In\nour example we're using it to define the position and area of the\nsub-image on the tileset that we want to extract. Pixi textures have a useful\nproperty called `frame` that can be set to any `Rectangle` objects. \nThe `frame` crops the texture to the dimensions of the `Rectangle`.\nHere's how to use `frame`\nto crop the texture to the size and position of the rocket.\n```js\nconst rectangle = new Rectangle(192, 128, 64, 64);\ntexture.frame = rectangle;\n```\nYou can then use that cropped texture to create the sprite:\n```js\nconst rocket = new Sprite(texture);\n```\nAnd that's how it works!\n\nBecause making sprite textures from a tileset\nis something you\u2019ll do with great frequency, Pixi has a more convenient way\nto help you do this - let's find out what that is next.\n\n<a id='textureatlas'></a>\nUsing a texture atlas\n---------------------\n\nIf you\u2019re working on a big, complex game, you\u2019ll want a fast and\nefficient way to create sprites from tilesets. This is where a\n**texture atlas** becomes really useful. A texture atlas is a JSON\ndata file that contains the positions and sizes of sub-images on a\nmatching tileset PNG image. If you use a texture atlas, all you need\nto know about the sub-image you want to display is its name. You\ncan arrange your tileset images in any order and the JSON file\nwill keep track of their sizes and positions for you. This is\nreally convenient because it means the sizes and positions of\ntileset images aren\u2019t hard-coded into your game program. If you\nmake changes to the tileset, like adding images, resizing them,\nor removing them, just re-publish the JSON file and your game will\nuse that data to display the correct images. You won\u2019t have to\nmake any changes to your game code.\n\nPixi is compatible with a standard JSON texture atlas format that is\noutput by a popular software tool called [Texture\nPacker](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker). Texture Packer\u2019s\n\u201cEssential\u201d license is free. Let\u2019s find out how to use it to make a\ntexture atlas, and load the atlas into Pixi. (You don\u2019t have to use\nTexture Packer. Similar tools, like [Shoebox](http://renderhjs.net/shoebox/) or [spritesheet.js](https://github.com/krzysztof-o/spritesheet.js/), output PNG and JSON files\nin a standard format that is compatible with Pixi.)\n\nFirst, start with a collection of individual image files that you'd\nlike to use in your game.\n\n![Image files](/examples/images/screenshots/11.png)\n\n(All the images in this section were created by Lanea Zimmerman. You\ncan find more of her artwork\n[here](http://opengameart.org/users/sharm).\nThanks, Lanea!)\n\nNext, open Texture Packer and choose **JSON Hash** as the framework\ntype. Drag your images into Texture Packer's workspace. (You can\nalso point Texture Packer to any folder that contains your images.)\nIt will automatically arrange the images on a single tileset image, and give them names that match their original image names.\n\n![Image files](/examples/images/screenshots/12.png)\n\n(If you're using the free version of\nTexture Packer, set **Algorithm** to `Basic`, set **Trim mode** to\n`None`, set **Extrude** to `0`, set **Size constraints** to `Any size` and slide the **PNG Opt\nLevel** all the way to the left to `0`. These are the basic\nsettings that will allow the free version of Texture Packer to create\nyour files without any warnings or errors.)\n\nWhen you\u2019re done, click the **Publish** button. Choose the file name and\nlocation, and save the published files. You\u2019ll end up with 2 files: a\nPNG file and a JSON file. In this example my file names are\n`treasureHunter.json` and `treasureHunter.png`. To make your life easier,\njust keep both files in your project\u2019s `images` folder. (You can think\nof the JSON file as extra metadata for the image file, so it makes\nsense to keep both files in the same folder.)\nThe JSON file describes the name, size and position of each of the\nsub-images\nin the tileset. Here\u2019s an excerpt that describes the blob monster\nsub-image.\n```js\n\"blob.png\":\n{\n\t\"frame\": {\"x\":55,\"y\":2,\"w\":32,\"h\":24},\n\t\"rotated\": false,\n\t\"trimmed\": false,\n\t\"spriteSourceSize\": {\"x\":0,\"y\":0,\"w\":32,\"h\":24},\n\t\"sourceSize\": {\"w\":32,\"h\":24},\n\t\"pivot\": {\"x\":0.5,\"y\":0.5}\n},\n```\nThe `treasureHunter.json` file also contains \u201cdungeon.png\u201d,\n\u201cdoor.png\u201d, \"exit.png\", and \"explorer.png\" properties each with\nsimilar data. Each of these sub-images are called **frames**. Having\nthis data is really helpful because now you don\u2019t need to know the\nsize and position of each sub-image in the tileset. All you need to\nknow is the sprite\u2019s **frame id**. The frame id is just the name\nof the original image file, like \"blob.png\" or \"explorer.png\".\n\nAmong the many advantages to using a texture atlas is that you can\neasily add 2 pixels of padding around each image (Texture Packer does\nthis by default.) This is important to prevent the possibility of\n**texture bleed**. Texture bleed is an effect that happens when the\nedge of an adjacent image on the tileset appears next to a sprite.\nThis happens because of the way your computer's GPU (Graphics\nProcessing Unit) decides how to round fractional pixels values. Should\nit round them up or down? This will be different for each GPU.\nLeaving 1 or 2 pixels spacing around images on a tileset makes all\nimages display consistently.\n\n(Note: If you have two pixels of padding around a graphic, and you still notice a strange \"off by one pixel\" glitch in the\nway Pixi is displaying it, try changing the texture's scale mode\nalgorithm. Here's how: `texture.baseTexture.scaleMode =\nPIXI.SCALE_MODES.NEAREST;`. These glitches can sometimes happen\nbecause of GPU floating point rounding errors.)\n\nNow that you know how to create a texture atlas, let's find out how to\nload it into your game code.\n\n<a id='loadingatlas'></a>\nLoading the texture atlas\n-------------------------\n\nTo get the texture atlas into Pixi, load it using Pixi\u2019s\n`Loader`. If the JSON file was made with Texture Packer, the\n`Loader` will interpret the data and create a texture from each\nframe on the tileset automatically.  Here\u2019s how to use the `Loader` to load the `treasureHunter.json`\nfile. When it has loaded, the `setup` function will run.\n```js\nloader\n  .add(\"images/treasureHunter.json\")\n  .load(setup);\n```\nEach image on the tileset is now an individual texture in Pixi\u2019s\ncache. You can access each texture in the cache with the same name it\nhad in Texture Packer (\u201cblob.png\u201d, \u201cdungeon.png\u201d, \u201cexplorer.png\u201d,\netc.).\n\n<a id='creatingsprites'></a>\nCreating sprites from a loaded texture atlas\n--------------------------------------------\n\nPixi gives you three general ways to create a sprite from a texture atlas:\n\n1.\tUsing `TextureCache`:\n```js\nconst texture = TextureCache[\"frameId.png\"],\n    sprite = new Sprite(texture);\n```\n2.\tIf you\u2019ve used Pixi\u2019s `Loader` to load the texture atlas, use the \nloader\u2019s `resources`:\n```js\nconst sprite = new Sprite(\n  resources[\"images/treasureHunter.json\"].textures[\"frameId.png\"]\n);\n```\n3. That\u2019s way too much typing to do just to create a sprite! \nSo I suggest you create an alias called `id` that points to texture\u2019s \naltas\u2019s `textures` object, like this:\n```js\nconst id = resources[\"images/treasureHunter.json\"].textures; \n```\nThen you can just create each new sprite like this:\n```js\nconst sprite = new Sprite(id[\"frameId.png\"]);\n```\nMuch better!\n\nHere's how you could use these three different sprite creation\ntechniques in the `setup` function to create and display the\n`dungeon`, `explorer`, and `treasure` sprites.\n```js\n\n//Define variables that might be used in more \n//than one function\nlet dungeon, explorer, treasure, id;\n\nfunction setup() {\n\n  //There are 3 ways to make sprites from textures atlas frames\n\n  //1. Access the `TextureCache` directly\n  const dungeonTexture = TextureCache[\"dungeon.png\"];\n  dungeon = new Sprite(dungeonTexture);\n  app.stage.addChild(dungeon);\n\n  //2. Access the texture using through the loader's `resources`:\n  explorer = new Sprite(\n    resources[\"images/treasureHunter.json\"].textures[\"explorer.png\"]\n  );\n  explorer.x = 68;\n\n  //Center the explorer vertically\n  explorer.y = app.stage.height / 2 - explorer.height / 2;\n  app.stage.addChild(explorer);\n\n  //3. Create an optional alias called `id` for all the texture atlas \n  //frame id textures.\n  id = resources[\"images/treasureHunter.json\"].textures; \n  \n  //Make the treasure box using the alias\n  treasure = new Sprite(id[\"treasure.png\"]);\n  app.stage.addChild(treasure);\n\n  //Position the treasure next to the right edge of the canvas\n  treasure.x = app.stage.width - treasure.width - 48;\n  treasure.y = app.stage.height / 2 - treasure.height / 2;\n  app.stage.addChild(treasure);\n}\n```\nHere's what this code displays:\n\n![Explorer, dungeon and treasure](/examples/images/screenshots/13.png)\n\nThe stage dimensions are 512 by 512 pixels, and you can see in the\ncode above that the `app.stage.height` and `app.stage.width` properties are used\nto align the sprites. Here's how the `explorer`'s `y` position is\nvertically centered:\n```js\nexplorer.y = app.stage.height / 2 - explorer.height / 2;\n```\nLearning to create and display sprites using a texture atlas is an\nimportant benchmark. So before we continue, let's take a look at the\ncode you\ncould write to add the remaining\nsprites: the `blob`s and `exit` door, so that you can produce a scene\nthat looks like this:\n\n![All the texture atlas sprites](/examples/images/screenshots/14.png)\n\nHere's the entire code that does all this. I've also included the HTML\ncode so you can see everything in its proper context.\n(You'll find this working code in the\n`examples/spriteFromTextureAtlas.html` file in this repository.)\nNotice that the `blob` sprites are created and added to the stage in a\nloop, and assigned random positions.\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n  <html>\n  <head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n  <title>Make a sprite from a texture atlas</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <script src=\"../pixi/pixi.min.js\"></script>\n    <script>\n\n      //Aliases\n      const Application = PIXI.Application,\n          Container = PIXI.Container,\n          loader = PIXI.Loader.shared,\n          resources = PIXI.Loader.shared.resources,\n          TextureCache = PIXI.utils.TextureCache,\n          Sprite = PIXI.Sprite,\n          Rectangle = PIXI.Rectangle;\n\n      //Create a Pixi Application\n      const app = new Application({ \n          width: 512, \n          height: 512,                       \n          antialias: true, \n          transparent: false, \n          resolution: 1\n        }\n      );\n\n      //Add the canvas that Pixi automatically created for you to the HTML document\n      document.body.appendChild(app.view);\n\n      //load a JSON file and run the `setup` function when it's done\n      loader\n        .add(\"images/treasureHunter.json\")\n        .load(setup);\n\n      //Define variables that might be used in more \n      //than one function\n      let dungeon, explorer, treasure, door, id;\n\n      function setup() {\n\n        //There are 3 ways to make sprites from textures atlas frames\n\n        //1.

Create an optional alias called `id` for all the texture atlas \n        //frame id textures.\n        id = resources[\"images/treasureHunter.json\"].textures; \n        \n        //Make the treasure box using the alias\n        treasure = new Sprite(id[\"treasure.png\"]);\n        app.stage.addChild(treasure);\n\n        //Position the treasure next to the right edge of the canvas\n        treasure.x = app.stage.width - treasure.width - 48;\n        treasure.y = app.stage.height / 2 - treasure.height / 2;\n        app.stage.addChild(treasure);\n\n        //Make the exit door\n        door = new Sprite(id[\"door.png\"]); \n        door.position.set(32, 0);\n        app.stage.addChild(door);\n\n        //Make the blobs\n        const numberOfBlobs = 6,\n            spacing = 48,\n            xOffset = 150;\n\n        //Make as many blobs as there are `numberOfBlobs`\n        for (let i = 0; i < numberOfBlobs; i++) {\n\n          //Make a blob\n          const blob = new Sprite(id[\"blob.png\"]);\n\n          //Space each blob horizontally according to the `spacing` value.\n          //`xOffset` determines the point from the left of the screen\n          //at which the first blob should be added.\n          const x = spacing * i + xOffset;\n\n          //Give the blob a random y position\n          //(`randomInt` is a custom function - see below)\n          const y = randomInt(0, app.stage.height - blob.height);\n\n          //Set the blob's position\n          blob.x = x;\n          blob.y = y;\n\n          //Add the blob sprite to the stage\n          app.stage.addChild(blob);\n        }\n      }\n\n      //The `randomInt` helper function\n      function randomInt(min, max) {\n        return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;\n      }\n\n    </script>\n  </body>\n  </html>\n```\nYou can see in the code above that all the blobs are created using a\n`for` loop. Each `blob` is spaced evenly along the `x` axis like this:\n```js\nconst x = spacing * i + xOffset;\nblob.x = x;\n```\n`spacing` has a value 48, and `xOffset` has a value of 150. What this\nmeans is the first `blob` will have an `x` position of 150.\nThis offsets it from the left side of the stage by 150 pixels. Each\nsubsequent `blob` will have an `x` value that's 48 pixels greater than\nthe `blob` created in the previous iteration of the loop. This creates\nan evenly spaced line of blob monsters, from left to right, along the dungeon floor.\n\nEach `blob` is also given a random `y` position. Here's the code that\ndoes this:\n```js\nconst y = randomInt(0, stage.height - blob.height);\nblob.y = y;\n```\nThe `blob`'s `y` position could be assigned any random number between 0 and\n512, which is the value of `stage.height`. This works with the help of\na custom function called `randomInt`. `randomInt` returns a random number\nthat's within a range between any two numbers you supply.\n```js\nrandomInt(lowestNumber, highestNumber);\n```\nThat means if you want a random number between 1 and 10, you can get\none like this:\n```js\nconst randomNumber = randomInt(1, 10);\n```\nHere's the `randomInt` function definition that does all this work:\n```js\nfunction randomInt(min, max) {\n  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;\n}\n```\n`randomInt` is a great little function to keep in your back pocket for\nmaking games - I use it all the time.\n\n<a id='movingsprites'></a>\nMoving Sprites\n--------------\n\nYou now know how to display sprites, but how do you make them move?\nThat's easy: create a looping function using Pixi's `ticker` \nThis is called a **game loop**.\nAny code you put inside the game loop will update 60 times per\nsecond. Here's some code you could write to make the `cat` sprite move\nto the right at a rate of 1 pixel per frame.\n```js\n\nfunction setup() {\n\n  //Start the game loop by adding the `gameLoop` function to\n  //Pixi's `ticker` and providing it with a `delta` argument.\n  app.ticker.add((delta) => gameLoop(delta));\n}\n\nfunction gameLoop(delta) {\n\n  //Move the cat 1 pixel \n  cat.x += 1;\n}\n```\nIf you run this bit of code, you'll see the sprite gradually move to\nthe right side of the stage. \n\n![Moving sprites](/examples/images/screenshots/15.png)\n\nThat's because each time the `gameLoop` runs, it adds 1 to the cat's x position.\n```js\ncat.x += 1;\n```\n\nAny function you add to Pixi's `ticker` will be called 60 times per second. You can see that the function is provided a `delta` argument - what's that?\n\nThe `delta` value represents the amount of fractional lag between frames. You can optionally add it to the cat's position, to make the cat's animation independent of the frame rate. Here's how:\n```js\ncat.x += 1 + delta;\n```\nWhether or not you choose to add this `delta` value is largely an aestheic choice. And the effect will only really be noticeable if your animation is struggling to keep up with a consistent 60 frames per second display rate (which might happen, for example, if it's running on a slow device). The rest of the examples in this tutorial won't use this `delta` value, but feel free to use it in your own work if you wish.\n\nYou don't have to use Pixi's `ticker` to create a game loop. If you prefer, just use `requestAnimationFrame`, like this:\n\n```js\nfunction gameLoop() {\n\n  //Call this `gameLoop` function on the next screen refresh\n  //(which happens 60 times per second)\n  requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);\n\n  //Move the cat\n  cat.x += 1;\n}\n\n//Start the loop\ngameLoop();\n\n```\n\nIt entirely up to you which style you prefer.\n\nThat's really all there is to it! Just change any sprite property by small\nincrements inside the loop, and they'll animate over time. If you want\nthe sprite to animate in the opposite direction (to the left), just give it a\nnegative value, like `-1`.\n\nYou'll find this code in the `movingSprites.html` file - here's the\ncomplete code:\n```js\n//Aliases\nconst Application = PIXI.Application,\n    Container = PIXI.Container,\n    loader = PIXI.Loader.shared,\n    resources = PIXI.Loader.shared.resources,\n    TextureCache = PIXI.utils.TextureCache,\n    Sprite = PIXI.Sprite,\n    Rectangle = PIXI.Rectangle;\n\n//Create a Pixi Application\nconst app = new Application({ \n    width: 256, \n    height: 256,                       \n    antialias: true, \n    transparent: false, \n    resolution: 1\n  }\n);\n\n//Add the canvas that Pixi automatically created for you to the HTML document\ndocument.body.appendChild(app.view);\n\nloader\n  .add(\"images/cat.png\")\n  .load(setup);\n\n//Define any variables that are used in more than one function\nlet cat;\n\nfunction setup() {\n\n  //Create the `cat` sprite \n  cat = new Sprite(resources[\"images/cat.png\"].texture);\n  cat.y = 96; \n  app.stage.addChild(cat);\n \n  //Start the game loop \n  app.ticker.add((delta) => gameLoop(delta));\n}\n\nfunction gameLoop(delta) {\n\n  //Move the cat 1 pixel \n  cat.x += 1;\n  \n  //Optionally use the `delta` value\n  //cat.x += 1 + delta;\n}\n```\n(Notice that the `cat` variable needs to be defined outside the\n`setup` and\n`gameLoop` functions so that you can access it inside both of them.)\n\nYou can animate a sprite's scale, rotation, or size - whatever! You'll see\nmany more examples of how to animate sprites ahead.\n\n<a id='velocity'></a>\nUsing velocity properties\n-------------------------\n\nTo give you more flexibility, it's a good idea to control a sprite's\nmovement speed using two **velocity properties**: `vx` and `vy`. `vx`\nis used to set the sprite's speed and direction on the x axis\n(horizontally). `vy` is\nused to set the sprite's speed and direction on the y axis (vertically). Instead of\nchanging a sprite's `x` and `y` values directly, first update the velocity\nvariables, and then assign those velocity values to the sprite. This is an\nextra bit of modularity that you'll need for interactive game animation.\n\nThe first step is to create `vx` and `vy` properties on your sprite,\nand give them an initial value.\n```js\ncat.vx = 0;\ncat.vy = 0;\n```\nSetting `vx` and `vy` to 0 means that the sprite isn't moving.\n\nNext, in the game loop, update `vx` and `vy` with the velocity at which you\nwant the sprite to move. Then assign those values to the\nsprite's `x` and `y` properties. Here's how you could use this\ntechnique to make the cat sprite move down and to right at one pixel each\nframe:\n```js\nfunction setup() {\n\n  //Create the `cat` sprite \n  cat = new Sprite(resources[\"images/cat.png\"].texture);\n  cat.y = 96; \n  cat.vx = 0;\n  cat.vy = 0;\n  app.stage.addChild(cat);\n \n  //Start the game loop\n  app.ticker.add((delta) => gameLoop(delta));\n}\n\nfunction gameLoop(delta) {\n\n  //Update the cat's velocity\n  cat.vx = 1;\n  cat.vy = 1;\n\n  //Apply the velocity values to the cat's \n  //position to make it move\n  cat.x += cat.vx;\n  cat.y += cat.vy;\n}\n\n\n```\nWhen you run this code, the cat will move down and to the right at one\npixel per frame:\n\n![Moving sprites](/examples/images/screenshots/16.png)\n\nWhat if you want to make the cat move in a different direction? To\nmake the cat move to the left, give it a `vx` value of `-1`. To make\nit move up, give the cat a `vy` value of `-1`. To make the cat move\nfaster, give it larger `vx` and `vy` values, like `3`, `5`, `-2`, or\n`-4`.\n\nYou'll see ahead how modularizing a sprite's velocity with `vx` and\n`vy` velocity properties helps with keyboard and mouse pointer\ncontrol systems for games, as well as making it easier to implement physics.\n\n<a id='gamestates'></a>\nGame states\n-----------\n\nAs a matter of style, and to help modularize your code, I\nrecommend structuring your game loop like this:\n```js\n//Set the game state\nstate = play;\n \n//Start the game loop \napp.ticker.add((delta) => gameLoop(delta));\n\nfunction gameLoop(delta) {\n\n  //Update the current game state:\n  state(delta);\n}\n\nfunction play(delta) {\n\n  //Move the cat 1 pixel to the right each frame\n  cat.vx = 1;\n  cat.x += cat.vx;\n}\n```\nYou can see that the `gameLoop` is calling a function called `state` 60 times\nper second. What is the `state` function? It's been assigned to\n`play`. That means all the code in the `play` function will also run at 60\ntimes per second.\n\nHere's how the code from the previous example can be re-factored to\nthis new model:\n```js\n//Define any variables that are used in more than one function\nlet cat, state;\n\nfunction setup() {\n\n  //Create the `cat` sprite \n  cat = new Sprite(resources[\"images/cat.png\"].texture);\n  cat.y = 96; \n  cat.vx = 0;\n  cat.vy = 0;\n  app.stage.addChild(cat);\n\n  //Set the game state\n  state = play;\n \n  //Start the game loop \n  app.ticker.add((delta) => gameLoop(delta));\n}\n\nfunction gameLoop(delta) {\n\n  //Update the current game state:\n  state(delta);\n}\n\nfunction play(delta) {\n\n  //Move the cat 1 pixel to the right each frame\n  cat.vx = 1;\n  cat.x += cat.vx;\n}\n```\nYes, I know, this is a bit of [head-swirler](http://www.amazon.com/Electric-Psychedelic-Sitar-Headswirlers-1-5/dp/B004HZ14VS)! But, don't let it scare\nyou and spend a minute or two walking through in your mind how those\nfunctions are connected. As you'll see ahead, structuring your game\nloop like this will make it much, much easier to do things like switching\ngame scenes and levels.\n\n<a id='keyboard'></a>\nKeyboard Movement\n-----------------\n\nWith just a little more work you can build a simple system to control\na sprite using the keyboard. To simplify your code, I suggest you use\nthis custom function called `keyboard` that listens for and captures\nkeyboard events.\n```js\nfunction keyboard(value) {\n  const key = {};\n  key.value = value;\n  key.isDown = false;\n  key.isUp = true;\n  key.press = undefined;\n  key.release = undefined;\n  //The `downHandler`\n  key.downHandler = (event) => {\n    if (event.key === key.value) {\n      if (key.isUp && key.press) {\n        key.press();\n      }\n      key.isDown = true;\n      key.isUp = false;\n      event.preventDefault();\n    }\n  };\n\n  //The `upHandler`\n  key.upHandler = (event) => {\n    if (event.key === key.value) {\n      if (key.isDown && key.release) {\n        key.release();\n      }\n      key.isDown = false;\n      key.isUp = true;\n      event.preventDefault();\n    }\n  };\n\n  //Attach event listeners\n  const downListener = key.downHandler.bind(key);\n  const upListener = key.upHandler.bind(key);\n  \n  window.addEventListener(\"keydown\", downListener, false);\n  window.addEventListener(\"keyup\", upListener, false);\n  \n  // Detach event listeners\n  key.unsubscribe = () => {\n    window.removeEventListener(\"keydown\", downListener);\n    window.removeEventListener(\"keyup\", upListener);\n  };\n  \n  return key;\n}\n```\nThe `keyboard` function is easy to use. Create a new keyboard object like this:\n```js\nconst keyObject = keyboard(keyValue);\n```\nIts one argument is the key value that you want to listen for.\n[Here's a list of keys](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values).\n\nThen assign `press` and `release` methods to the keyboard object like this:\n```js\nkeyObject.press = () => {\n  //key object pressed\n};\nkeyObject.release = () => {\n  //key object released\n};\n```\nKeyboard objects also have `isDown` and `isUp` Boolean properties that\nyou can use to check the state of each key.\n\nDon't forget to remove event listeners by using the `unsubscribe` method:\n```js\nkeyObject.unsubscribe();\n```\n\nTake a look at the\n`keyboardMovement.html` file in the `examples` folder to see how you\ncan use this `keyboard` function to control a sprite using your\nkeyboard's arrow keys. Run it and use the left, up, down, and right\narrow keys to move the cat around the stage.\n\n![Keyboard movement](/examples/images/screenshots/17.png)\n\nHere's the code that does all this:\n```js\n//Define any variables that are used in more than one function\nlet cat, state;\n\nfunction setup() {\n\n  //Create the `cat` sprite \n  cat = new Sprite(resources[\"images/cat.png\"].texture);\n  cat.y = 96; \n  cat.vx = 0;\n  cat.vy = 0;\n  app.stage.addChild(cat);\n\n  //Capture the keyboard arrow keys\n  const left = keyboard(\"ArrowLeft\"),\n      up = keyboard(\"ArrowUp\"),\n      right = keyboard(\"ArrowRight\"),\n      down = keyboard(\"ArrowDown\");\n\n  //Left arrow key `press` method\n  left.press = () => {\n    //Change the cat's velocity when the key is pressed\n    cat.vx = -5;\n    cat.vy = 0;\n  };\n  \n  //Left arrow key `release` method\n  left.release = () => {\n    //If the left arrow has been released, and the right arrow isn't down,\n    //and the cat isn't moving vertically:\n    //Stop the cat\n    if (!right.isDown && cat.vy === 0) {\n      cat.vx = 0;\n    }\n  };\n\n  //Up\n  up.press = () => {\n    cat.vy = -5;\n    cat.vx = 0;\n  };\n  up.release = () => {\n    if (!down.isDown && cat.vx === 0) {\n      cat.vy = 0;\n    }\n  };\n\n  //Right\n  right.press = () => {\n    cat.vx = 5;\n    cat.vy = 0;\n  };\n  right.release = () => {\n    if (!left.isDown && cat.vy === 0) {\n      cat.vx = 0;\n    }\n  };\n\n  //Down\n  down.press = () => {\n    cat.vy = 5;\n    cat.vx = 0;\n  };\n  down.release = () => {\n    if (!up.isDown && cat.vx === 0) {\n      cat.vy = 0;\n    }\n  };\n\n  //Set the game state\n  state = play;\n \n  //Start the game loop \n  app.ticker.add((delta) => gameLoop(delta));\n}\n\nfunction gameLoop(delta) {\n\n  //Update the current game state:\n  state(delta);\n}\n\nfunction play(delta) {\n\n  //Use the cat's velocity to make it move\n  cat.x += cat.vx;\n  cat.y += cat.vy;\n}\n```\n\n<a id='grouping'></a>\nGrouping Sprites\n----------------\n\nGroups let you create game scenes, and manage similar sprites together\nas single units. Pixi has an object called a `Container`\nthat lets you do this. Let's find out how it works.\n\nImagine that you want to display three sprites: a cat, hedgehog and\ntiger. Create them, and set their positions - *but don't add them to the\nstage*.\n```js\n//The cat\nconst cat = new Sprite(id[\"cat.png\"]);\ncat.position.set(16, 16);\n\n//The hedgehog\nconst hedgehog = new Sprite(id[\"hedgehog.png\"]);\nhedgehog.position.set(32, 32);\n\n//The tiger\nconst tiger = new Sprite(id[\"tiger.png\"]);\ntiger.position.set(64, 64);\n```\n\nNext, create an `animals` container to group them all together like\nthis:\n```js\nconst animals = new Container();\n```\nThen use `addChild` to *add the sprites to the group*.\n```js\nanimals.addChild(cat);\nanimals.addChild(hedgehog);\nanimals.addChild(tiger);\n```\nFinally add the group to the stage.\n```js\napp.stage.addChild(animals);\n```\n(As you know, the `stage` object is also a `Container`. It\u2019s the root\ncontainer for all Pixi sprites.)\n\nHere's what this code produces:\n\n![Grouping sprites](/examples/images/screenshots/18.png)\n\nWhat you can't see in that image is the invisible `animals` group\nthat's containing the sprites.\n\n![Grouping sprites](/examples/images/screenshots/19.png)\n\nYou can now treat the `animals` group as a single unit. You can think\nof a `Container` as a special kind of sprite that doesn\u2019t\nhave a texture.\n\nIf you need a list of all the child sprites that `animals` contains,\nuse its `children` array to find out.\n```js\nconsole.log(animals.children);\n//Displays: Array [Object, Object, Object]\n```\nThis tells you that `animals` has three sprites as children.\n\nBecause the `animals` group is just like any other sprite, you can\nchange its `x` and `y` values, `alpha`, `scale` and\nall the other sprite properties. Any property value you change on the\nparent container will affect the child sprites in a relative way. So if you\nset the group's `x` and `y` position, all the child sprites will\nbe repositioned relative to the group's top left corner. What would\nhappen if you set the `animals`'s `x` and `y` position to 64?\n```js\nanimals.position.set(64, 64);\n```\nThe whole group of sprites will move 64 pixels right and 64 pixels to\nthe down.\n\n![Grouping sprites](/examples/images/screenshots/20.png)\n\nThe `animals` group also has its own dimensions, which is based on the area\noccupied by the containing sprites. You can find its `width` and\n`height` values like this:\n```js\nconsole.log(animals.width);\n//Displays: 112\n\nconsole.log(animals.height);\n//Displays: 112\n\n```\n![Group width and height](/examples/images/screenshots/21.png)\n\nWhat happens if you change a group's width or height?\n```js\nanimals.width = 200;\nanimals.height = 200;\n```\nAll the child sprites will scale to match that change.\n\n![Group width and height](/examples/images/screenshots/22.png)\n\nYou can nest as many `Container`s inside other\n`Container`s as you like, to create deep hierarchies if\nyou need to. However, a `DisplayObject` (like a `Sprite` or another\n`Container`) can only belong to one parent at a time. If\nyou use `addChild` to make a sprite the child of another object, Pixi\nwill automatically remove it from its current parent. That\u2019s a useful\nbit of management that you don\u2019t have to worry about.\n\n<a id='localnglobal'></a>\n### Local and global positions\n\nWhen you add a sprite to a `Container`, its `x` and `y`\nposition is *relative to the group\u2019s top left corner*. That's the\nsprite's **local position** For example, what do you think the cat's\nposition is in this image?\n\n![Grouping sprites](/examples/images/screenshots/20.png)\n\nLet's find out:\n```js\nconsole.log(cat.x);\n//Displays: 16\n```\n16? Yes! That's because the cat is offset by only 16 pixel's from the\ngroup's top left corner. 16 is the cat's local position.\n\nSprites also have a **global position**. The global position is the\ndistance from the top left corner of the stage, to the sprite's anchor\npoint (usually the sprite's top left corner.) You can find a sprite's global\nposition with the help of the `toGlobal` method.  Here's how:\n```js\nparentSprite.toGlobal(childSprite.position);\n```\nThat means you can find the cat's global position inside the `animals`\ngroup like this:\n```js\nconsole.log(animals.toGlobal(cat.position));\n//Displays: Object {x: 80, y: 80...};\n```\nThat gives you an `x` and `y` position of 80. That's exactly the cat's\nglobal position relative to the top left corner of the stage. \n\nWhat if you want to find the global position of a sprite, but don't\nknow what the sprite's parent container\nis? Every sprite has a property called `parent` that will tell you what the\nsprite's parent is. If you add a sprite directly to the `stage`, then\n`stage` will be the sprite's parent. In the example above, the `cat`'s\nparent is `animals`. That means you can alternatively get the cat's global position\nby writing code like this:\n```js\ncat.parent.toGlobal(cat.position);\n```\nAnd it will work even if you don't know what the cat's parent\ncontainer currently is.\n\nThere's one more way to calculate the global position! And, it's\nactually the best way, so listen up! If you want to know the distance\nfrom the top left corner of the canvas to the sprite, and don't know\nor care what the sprite's parent containers are, use the\n`getGlobalPosition` method. Here's how to use it to find the tiger's global position:\n```js\ntiger.getGlobalPosition().x;\ntiger.getGlobalPosition().y;\n```\nThis will give you `x` and `y` values of 128 in the example that we've\nbeen using.\nThe special thing about `getGlobalPosition` is that it's highly\nprecise: it will give you the sprite's accurate global position as\nsoon as its local position changes. I asked the Pixi development team\nto add this feature specifically for accurate collision detection for\ngames. (Thanks, Matt and the rest of the team for adding it!)\n\nWhat if you want to convert a global position to a local position? you\ncan use the `toLocal` method. It works in a similar way, but uses this\ngeneral format:\n```js\nsprite.toLocal(sprite.position, anyOtherSprite);\n```\nUse `toLocal` to find the distance between a sprite and any other\nsprite. Here's how you could find out the tiger's local\nposition, relative to the hedgehog.\n```js\ntiger.toLocal(tiger.position, hedgehog).x;\ntiger.toLocal(tiger.position, hedgehog).y;\n```\nThis gives you an `x` value of 32 and a `y` value of 32. You can see\nin the example images that the tiger's top left corner is 32 pixels\ndown and to the left of the hedgehog's top left corner.\n\n<a id='spritebatch'></a>\n### Using a ParticleContainer to group sprites\n\nPixi has an alternative, high-performance way to group sprites called\na `ParticleContainer` (`PIXI.ParticleContainer`). Any sprites inside a `ParticleContainer` will render 2 to 5\ntimes faster than they would if they were in a regular\n`Container`. It\u2019s a great performance boost for games.\n\nCreate a `ParticleContainer` like this:\n```js\nconst superFastSprites = new ParticleContainer();\n```\nThen use `addChild` to add sprites to it, just like you would with any\nordinary `Container`.\n\nYou have to make some compromises if you decide to use a\n`ParticleContainer`. Sprites inside a `ParticleContainer` only have a few basic properties:\n`x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, `scale`, `pivot`, `alpha`, `visible` \u2013 and that\u2019s\nabout it. Also, the sprites that it contains can\u2019t have nested\nchildren of their own. A `ParticleContainer` also can\u2019t use Pixi\u2019s advanced\nvisual effects like filters and blend modes. Each `ParticleContainer` can use only one texture (so you'll have to use a spritesheet if you want Sprites with different appearances). But for the huge performance boost that you get, those\ncompromises are usually worth it. And you can use\n`Container`s and `ParticleContainer`s simultaneously in the same project, so you can fine-tune your optimization.\n\nWhy are sprites in a `ParticleContainer` so fast? Because the positions of\nthe sprites are being calculated directly on the GPU. The Pixi\ndevelopment team is working to offload as much sprite processing as\npossible on the GPU, so it\u2019s likely that the latest version of Pixi\nthat you\u2019re using will have much more feature-rich `ParticleContainer` than\nwhat I've described here. Check [`ParticleContainer`\ndocumentation](http://pixijs.download/v5.3.10/docs/PIXI.ParticleContainer.html) for details.\n\nWhere you create a `ParticleContainer`, there are four optional\narguments you can provide: `maxSize`, `properties`, `batchSize` and `autoResize`.\n```js\nconst superFastSprites = new ParticleContainer(maxSize, properties, batchSize, autoResize);\n```\nThe default value for `maxSize` is 1500. So, if you need to contain more\nsprites, set it to a higher number. The `properties` argument is an object\nwith 5 Boolean values you can set: `vertices`, `position`, `rotation`, `uvs` and\n`tint`. The default value of `position` is `true`, but all the others\nare set to `false`. That means that if you want to change the `rotation`,\n`vertices`, `tint`, or `uvs` of sprite in the `ParticleContainer`, you\nhave to set those properties to `true`, like this:\n```js\nconst superFastSprites = new ParticleContainer(\n  maxSize, \n  {\n    rotation: true,\n    tint: true,\n    vertices: true,\n    uvs: true\n  }\n);\n```\nBut, if you don't think you'll need to use these properties, keep them\nset to `false` to squeeze out the maximum amount of performance.\n\nWhat's the `uvs` property? Only set it to `true` if you have particles\nwhich change their textures while they're being animated. (All the\nsprite's textures will also need to be on the same tileset image for\nthis to work.) \n\n(Note: **UV mapping** is a 3D graphics display term that refers to\nthe `x` and `y` coordinates of the texture (the image) that is being\nmapped onto a 3D surface. `U` is the `x` axis and `V` is the `y` axis.\nWebGL already uses `x`, `y` and `z` for 3D spatial positioning, so `U`\nand `V` were chosen to represent `x` and `y` for 2D image textures.)\n\n(I'm not sure what exactly what those last two optional arguments, `batchSize` and `autoResize`, so if anyone knows, please let us know in the Issues!)\n\n<a id='graphic'></a>\nPixi's Graphic Primitives\n-------------------------\n\nUsing image textures is one of the most useful ways of making sprites,\nbut Pixi also has its own low-level drawing tools. You can use them to\nmake rectangles, shapes, lines, complex polygons and text.\nFortunately, it uses almost the same API as the [Canvas Drawing API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Drawing_graphics_with_canvas) so,\nif you're already familiar with canvas, there\u2019s nothing really new to\nlearn. But the big advantage is that, unlike the Canvas Drawing API,\nthe shapes you draw with Pixi are rendered by WebGL on the GPU. Pixi\nlets you access all that untapped performance power.\nLet\u2019s take a quick tour of how to make some basic shapes. Here are all\nthe shapes we'll make in the code ahead.\n\n![Graphic primitives](/examples/images/screenshots/23.png)\n\n<a id='rectangles'></a>\n### Rectangles\n\nAll shapes are made by first creating a new instance of Pixi's\n`Graphics` class (`PIXI.Graphics`).\n```js\nconst rectangle = new Graphics();\n```\nUse `beginFill` with a hexadecimal color code value to set the\nrectangle\u2019 s fill color. Here\u2019 how to set to it to light blue.\n```js\nrectangle.beginFill(0x66CCFF);\n```\nIf you want to give the shape an outline, use the `lineStyle` method. Here's\nhow to give the rectangle a 4 pixel wide red outline, with an `alpha`\nvalue of 1.\n```js\nrectangle.lineStyle({width: 4, color: 0xFF3300, alpha: 1});\n```\nUse the `drawRect` method to draw the rectangle. Its four arguments\nare `x`, `y`, `width` and `height`.\n```js\nrectangle.drawRect(x, y, width, height);\n```\nUse `endFill` when you\u2019re done.\n```js\nrectangle.endFill();\n```\nIt\u2019s just like the Canvas Drawing API! Here\u2019s all the code you need to\ndraw a rectangle, change its position, and add it to the stage.\n```js\nconst rectangle = new Graphics();\nrectangle.lineStyle({width: 4, color: 0xFF3300, alpha: 1});\nrectangle.beginFill(0x66CCFF);\nrectangle.drawRect(0, 0, 64, 64);\nrectangle.endFill();\nrectangle.x = 170;\nrectangle.y = 170;\napp.stage.addChild(rectangle);\n\n```\nThis code makes a 64 by 64 blue rectangle with a red border at an x and y position of 170.\n\n<a id='circles'></a>\n### Circles\n\nMake a circle with the `drawCircle` method. Its three arguments are\n`x`, `y` and `radius`\n```js\ndrawCircle(x, y, radius);\n```\nUnlike rectangles and sprites, a circle\u2019s x and y position is also its\ncenter point. Here\u2019s how to make a violet colored circle with a radius of 32 pixels.\n```js\nconst circle = new Graphics();\ncircle.beginFill(0x9966FF);\ncircle.drawCircle(0, 0, 32);\ncircle.endFill();\ncircle.x = 64;\ncircle.y = 130;\napp.stage.addChild(circle);\n```\n<a id='ellipses'></a>\n### Ellipses\n\nAs a one-up on the Canvas Drawing API, Pixi lets you draw an ellipse\nwith the `drawEllipse` method.\n```js\ndrawEllipse(x, y, width, height);\n```\nThe x/y position defines the center of the ellipse. Here\u2019s a yellow ellipse that\u2019s 100 pixels wide and 40 pixels high.\n```js\nconst ellipse = new Graphics();\nellipse.beginFill(0xFFFF00);\nellipse.drawEllipse(0, 0, 50, 20);\nellipse.endFill();\nellipse.x = 180;\nellipse.y = 130;\napp.stage.addChild(ellipse);\n```\n<a id='roundedrect'></a>\n### Rounded rectangles\n\nPixi also lets you make rounded rectangles with the `drawRoundedRect`\nmethod. The last argument, `cornerRadius` is a number in pixels that\ndetermines by how much the corners should be rounded.\n```js\ndrawRoundedRect(x, y, width, height, cornerRadius);\n```\nHere's how to make a rounded rectangle with a corner radius of 10\npixels.\n```js\nconst roundBox = new Graphics();\nroundBox.lineStyle({width: 4, color: 0x99CCFF, alpha: 1});\nroundBox.beginFill(0xFF9933);\nroundBox.drawRoundedRect(0, 0, 84, 36, 10);\nroundBox.endFill();\nroundBox.x = 48;\nroundBox.y = 190;\napp.stage.addChild(roundBox);\n```\n<a id='lines'></a>\n### Lines\n\nYou've seen in the examples above that the `lineStyle` method lets you\ndefine a line. You can use the `moveTo` and `lineTo` methods to draw the\nstart and end points of the line, in just the same way you can with the Canvas\nDrawing API. Here\u2019s how to draw a 4 pixel wide, white diagonal line.\n```js\nconst line = new Graphics();\nline.lineStyle({width: 4, color: 0xFFFFFF, alpha: 1});\nline.moveTo(0, 0);\nline.lineTo(80, 50);\nline.x = 32;\nline.y = 32;\napp.stage.addChild(line);\n```\n`PIXI.Graphics` objects, like lines, have `x` and `y` values, just\nlike sprites, so you can position them anywhere on the stage after\nyou've drawn them.\n\n<a id='polygons'></a>\n### Polygons\n\nYou can join lines together and fill them with colors to make complex\nshapes using the `drawPolygon` method. `drawPolygon`'s argument is a\npath array of x/y points that define the positions of each point on the\nshape.\n```js\nconst path = [\n  point1X, point1Y,\n  point2X, point2Y,\n  point3X, point3Y\n];\n\ngraphicsObject.drawPolygon(path);\n```\n`drawPolygon` will join those three points together to make the shape.\nHere\u2019s how to use `drawPolygon` to connect three lines together to\nmake a red triangle with a blue border. The triangle is drawn at\nposition 0,0 and then moved to its position on the stage using its\n`x` and `y` properties.\n```js\nconst triangle = new Graphics();\ntriangle.beginFill(0x66FF33);\n\n//Use `drawPolygon` to define the triangle as\n//a path array of x/y positions\n\ntriangle.drawPolygon([\n    -32, 64,             //First point\n    32, 64,              //Second point\n    0, 0                 //Third point\n]);\n\n//Fill shape's color\ntriangle.endFill();\n\n//Position the triangle after you've drawn it.\n//The triangle's x/y position is anchored to its first point in the path\ntriangle.x = 180;\ntriangle.y = 22;\n\napp.stage.addChild(triangle);\n```\n<a id='text'></a>\n\nDisplaying text\n---------------\n\nUse a `Text` object (`PIXI.Text`) to display text on the stage. In its simplest form, you can do it like this:\n```js\nconst message = new Text(\"Hello Pixi!\");\napp.stage.addChild(message);\n```\n\nThis will display the words, \"Hello, Pixi\" on the canvas. Pixi\u2019s Text objects inherit from the `Sprite` class, so they\ncontain all the same properties like `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`,\n`alpha`, and `rotation`. Position and resize text on the stage just like you would any other sprite. For example, you could use `position.set` to set the `message`'s `x` and `y` position like this:\n```js\nmessage.position.set(54, 96);\n```\n\n![Displaying text](/examples/images/screenshots/24.png)\n\nThat will give you basic, unstyled text. But if you want to get fancier, use Pixi's `TextStyle` function to define custom text styling. Here's how:\n\n```js\nconst style = new TextStyle({\n  fontFamily: \"Arial\",\n  fontSize: 36,\n  fill: \"white\",\n  stroke: \"#ff3300\",\n  strokeThickness: 4,\n  dropShadow: true,\n  dropShadowColor: \"#000000\",\n  dropShadowBlur: 4,\n  dropShadowAngle: Math.PI / 6,\n  dropShadowDistance: 6,\n});\n``` \nThat creates a new `style` object containing all the text styling that you'd like to use. For a complete list of all the style properties you can use, [see here](http://pixijs.download/v5.3.10/docs/PIXI.TextStyle.html).\n\nTo apply the style to the text, add the `style` object as the `Text` function's second argument, like this:\n```js\nconst message = new Text(\"Hello Pixi!\", style);\n``` \n![Displaying text](/examples/images/screenshots/24.5.png)\n\nIf you want to change the content of a text object after you've\ncreated it, use the `text` property.\n```js\nmessage.text = \"Text changed!\";\n```\nUse the `style` property if you want to redefine the style properties.\n```js\nmessage.style = {fill: \"black\", font: \"16px PetMe64\"};\n```\n\nPixi makes text objects by using the Canvas Drawing API to\nrender the text to an invisible and temporary canvas\nelement. It then turns the canvas into a WebGL texture so that it\ncan be mapped onto a sprite. That\u2019s why the text\u2019s color needs to be\nwrapped in a string: it\u2019s a Canvas Drawing API color value. As with\nany canvas color values, you can use words for common colors like\n\u201cred\u201d or \u201cgreen\u201d, or use rgba, hsla or hex values.\n\nPixi can also wrap long lines of text. Set the text\u2019s `wordWrap` style\nproperty to `true`, and then set `wordWrapWidth` to the maximum length\nin pixels, that the line of text should be. Use the `align` property\nto set the alignment for multi-line text.\n```js\nmessage.style = {wordWrap: true, wordWrapWidth: 100, align: 'center'};\n```\n(Note: `align` doesn't affect single line text.)\n\nIf you want to use a custom font file, use the CSS `@font-face` rule\nto link the font file to the HTML page where your Pixi application is\nrunning.\n```css\n@font-face {\n  font-family: \"fontFamilyName\";\n  src: url(\"fonts/fontFile.ttf\");\n}\n```\nAdd this `@font-face` rule to your HTML page's CSS style sheet.\n\n[Pixi also has support for bitmap\nfonts](http://pixijs.download/v5.3.10/docs/PIXI.BitmapText.html). You\ncan use Pixi's loader to load Bitmap font XML files, the same way you\nload JSON or image files.\n\n<a id='collision'></a>\nCollision detection\n--------------------------\n\nYou now know how to make a huge variety of graphics objects, but what\ncan you do with them? A fun thing to do is to build a simple **collision\ndetection** system. You can use a custom function called\n`hitTestRectangle` that checks whether any two rectangular Pixi sprites are\ntouching.\n```js\nhitTestRectangle(spriteOne, spriteTwo);\n```\nif they overlap, `hitTestRectangle` will return `true`. You can use `hitTestRectangle` with an `if` statement to check for a collision between two sprites like this:\n```js\nif (hitTestRectangle(cat, box)) {\n  //There's a collision\n} else {\n  //There's no collision\n}\n```\nAs you'll see, `hitTestRectangle` is the front door into the vast universe of game design.\n\nRun the `collisionDetection.html` file in the `examples` folder for a\nworking example of how to use `hitTestRectangle`. Use the arrow keys\nto move the cat. If the cat hits the box, the box becomes red\nand \"Hit!\" is displayed by the text object.\n\n![Displaying text](/examples/images/screenshots/25.png)\n\nYou've already seen all the code that creates all these elements, as\nwell as the\nkeyboard control system that makes the cat move. The only new thing is the\nway `hitTestRectangle` is used inside the `play` function to check for a\ncollision.\n```js\nfunction play(delta) {\n\n  //use the cat's velocity to make it move\n  cat.x += cat.vx;\n  cat.y += cat.vy;\n\n  //check for a collision between the cat and the box\n  if (hitTestRectangle(cat, box)) {\n\n    //if there's a collision, change the message text\n    //and tint the box red\n    message.text = \"hit!\";\n    box.tint = 0xff3300;\n\n  } else {\n\n    //if there's no collision, reset the message\n    //text and the box's color\n    message.text = \"No collision...\";\n    box.tint = 0xccff99;\n  }\n}\n```\nBecause the `play` function is being called by the game loop 60 times\nper second, this `if` statement is constantly checking for a collision\nbetween the cat and the box. If `hitTestRectangle` is `true`, the\ntext `message` object uses `text` to display \"Hit\":\n```js\nmessage.text = \"Hit!\";\n```\nThe color of the box is then changed from green to red by setting the\nbox's `tint` property to the hexadecimal red value.\n```js\nbox.tint = 0xff3300;\n```\nIf there's no collision, the message and box are maintained in their\noriginal states:\n```js\nmessage.text = \"No collision...\";\nbox.tint = 0xccff99;\n```\nThis code is pretty simple, but suddenly you've created an interactive\nworld that seems to be completely alive. It's almost like magic! And, perhaps\nsurprisingly, you now have all the skills you need to start making\ngames with Pixi!\n\n<a id='hittest'></a>\n### The hitTestRectangle function\n\nBut what about the `hitTestRectangle` function? What does it do, and\nhow does it work? The details of how collision detection algorithms\nlike this work is a little bit outside the scope of this tutorial. (If you really want to know, you can find out how [this book](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781430258001).)\nThe most important thing is that you know how to use it. But, just for\nyour reference, and in case you're curious, here's the complete\n`hitTestRectangle` function definition. Can you figure out from the\ncomments what it's doing?\n```js\nfunction hitTestRectangle(r1, r2) {\n\n  //Define the variables we'll need to calculate\n  let hit, combinedHalfWidths, combinedHalfHeights, vx, vy;\n\n  //hit will determine whether there's a collision\n  hit = false;\n\n  //Find the center points of each sprite\n  r1.centerX = r1.x + r1.width / 2;\n  r1.centerY = r1.y + r1.height / 2;\n  r2.centerX = r2.x + r2.width / 2;\n  r2.centerY = r2.y + r2.height / 2;\n\n  //Find the half-widths and half-heights of each sprite\n  r1.halfWidth = r1.width / 2;\n  r1.halfHeight = r1.height / 2;\n  r2.halfWidth = r2.width / 2;\n  r2.halfHeight = r2.height / 2;\n\n  //Calculate the distance vector between the sprites\n  vx = r1.centerX - r2.centerX;\n  vy = r1.centerY - r2.centerY;\n\n  //Figure out the combined half-widths and half-heights\n  combinedHalfWidths = r1.halfWidth + r2.halfWidth;\n  combinedHalfHeights = r1.halfHeight + r2.halfHeight;\n\n  //Check for a collision on the x axis\n  if (Math.abs(vx) < combinedHalfWidths) {\n\n    //A collision might be occurring. Check for a collision on the y axis\n    if (Math.abs(vy) < combinedHalfHeights) {\n\n      //There's definitely a collision happening\n      hit = true;\n    } else {\n\n      //There's no collision on the y axis\n      hit = false;\n    }\n  } else {\n\n    //There's no collision on the x axis\n    hit = false;\n  }\n\n  //`hit` will be either `true` or `false`\n  return hit;\n};\n\n```\n<a id='casestudy'></a>\nCase study: Treasure Hunter\n---------------\n\nI've told you that you now have all the skills you need to start\nmaking games. What? You don't believe me? Let me prove it to you! Let\u2019s take a\nclose at how to make a simple object collection and enemy\navoidance game called **Treasure Hunter**. (You'll find it in the `examples`\nfolder.)\n\n![Treasure Hunter](/examples/images/screenshots/26.png)\n\nTreasure Hunter is a good example of one of the simplest complete\ngames you can make using the tools you've learnt so far. Use the\nkeyboard arrow\nkeys to help the explorer find the treasure and carry it to the exit.\nSix blob monsters move up and down between the dungeon walls, and if\nthey hit the explorer he becomes semi-transparent and the health meter\nat the top right corner shrinks. If all the health is used up, \u201cYou\nLost!\u201d is displayed on the stage; if the explorer reaches the exit with\nthe treasure, \u201cYou Won!\u201d is displayed. Although it\u2019s a basic\nprototype, Treasure Hunter contains most of the elements you\u2019ll find\nin much bigger games: texture atlas graphics, interactivity,\ncollision, and multiple game scenes. Let\u2019s go on a tour of how the\ngame was put together so that you can use it as a starting point for one of your own games.\n\n### The code structure\n\nOpen the `treasureHunter.html` file and you'll see that all the game\ncode is in one big file. Here's a birds-eye view of how all the code is\norganized.\n\n```js\n//Setup Pixi and load the texture atlas files - call the `setup`\n//function when they've loaded\n\nfunction setup() {\n  //Initialize the game sprites, set the game `state` to `play`\n  //and start the 'gameLoop'\n}\n\nfunction gameLoop(delta) {\n  //Runs the current game `state` in a loop and renders the sprites\n}\n\nfunction play(delta) {\n  //All the game logic goes here\n}\n\nfunction end() {\n  //All the code that should run at the end of the game\n}\n\n//The game's helper functions:\n//`keyboard`, `hitTestRectangle`, `contain` and `randomInt`\n```\nUse this as your world map to the game as we look at how each\nsection works.\n\n<a id='initialize'></a>\n### Initialize the game in the setup function\n\nAs soon as the texture atlas images have loaded, the `setup` function\nruns. It only runs once, and lets you perform\none-time setup tasks for your game. It's a great place to create and initialize\nobjects, sprites, game scenes, populate data arrays or parse\nloaded JSON game data.\n\nHere's an abridged view of the `setup` function in Treasure Hunter,\nand the tasks that it performs.\n\n```js\nfunction setup() {\n  //Create the `gameScene` group\n  //Create the `door` sprite\n  //Create the `player` sprite\n  //Create the `treasure` sprite\n  //Make the enemies\n  //Create the health bar\n  //Add some text for the game over message\n  //Create a `gameOverScene` group\n  //Assign the player's keyboard controllers\n\n  //set the game state to `play`\n  state = play;\n\n  //Start the game loop \n  app.ticker.add((delta) => gameLoop(delta));\n}\n\n```\nThe last two lines of code, `state = play;` and `gameLoop()` are perhaps\nthe most important. Adding the `gameLoop` to Pixi's ticker switches on the game's engine,\nand causes the `play` function to be called in a continuous loop. But before we look at how that works, let's see what the\nspecific code inside the `setup` function does.\n\n<a id='gamescene'></a>\n#### Creating the game scenes\n\nThe `setup` function creates two `Container` groups called\n`gameScene` and `gameOverScene`. Each of these are added to the stage.\n```js\ngameScene = new Container();\napp.stage.addChild(gameScene);\n\ngameOverScene = new Container();\napp.stage.addChild(gameOverScene);\n\n```\nAll of the sprites that are part of the main game are added to the\n`gameScene` group. The game over text that should be displayed at the\nend of the game is added to the `gameOverScene` group.\n\n![Displaying text](/examples/images/screenshots/27.png)\n\nAlthough it's created in the `setup` function, the `gameOverScene`\nshouldn't be visible when the game first starts, so its `visible`\nproperty is initialized to `false`.\n```js\ngameOverScene.visible = false;\n```\nYou'll see ahead that, when the game ends, the `gameOverScene`'s `visible`\nproperty will be set to `true` to display the text that appears at the\nend of the game.\n\n<a id='makingdungon'></a>\n#### Making the dungeon, door, explorer and treasure\n\nThe player, exit door, treasure chest and the dungeon background image\nare all sprites made from texture atlas frames. Very importantly,\nthey're all added as children of the `gameScene`.\n```js\n//Create an alias for the texture atlas frame ids\nid = resources[\"images/treasureHunter.json\"].textures;\n\n//Dungeon\ndungeon = new Sprite(id[\"dungeon.png\"]);\ngameScene.addChild(dungeon);\n\n//Door\ndoor = new Sprite(id[\"door.png\"]);\ndoor.position.set(32, 0);\ngameScene.addChild(door);\n\n//Explorer\nexplorer = new Sprite(id[\"explorer.png\"]);\nexplorer.x = 68;\nexplorer.y = gameScene.height / 2 - explorer.height / 2;\nexplorer.vx = 0;\nexplorer.vy = 0;\ngameScene.addChild(explorer);\n\n//Treasure\ntreasure = new Sprite(id[\"treasure.png\"]);\ntreasure.x = gameScene.width - treasure.width - 48;\ntreasure.y = gameScene.height / 2 - treasure.height / 2;\ngameScene.addChild(treasure);\n```\nKeeping them together in the `gameScene` group will make it easy for\nus to hide the `gameScene` and display the `gameOverScene` when the game is finished.\n\n<a id='makingblob'></a>\n#### Making the blob monsters\n\nThe six blob monsters are created in a loop. Each blob is given a\nrandom initial position and velocity. The vertical velocity is\nalternately multiplied by `1` or `-1` for each blob, and that\u2019s what\ncauses each blob to move in the opposite direction to the one next to\nit. Each blob monster that's created is pushed into an array called\n`blobs`.\n```js\nlet numberOfBlobs = 6,\n    spacing = 48,\n    xOffset = 150,\n    speed = 2,\n    direction = 1;\n\n//An array to store all the blob monsters\nblobs = [];\n\n//Make as many blobs as there are `numberOfBlobs`\nfor (let i = 0; i < numberOfBlobs; i++) {\n\n  //Make a blob\n  const blob = new Sprite(id[\"blob.png\"]);\n\n  //Space each blob horizontally according to the `spacing` value.\n  //`xOffset` determines the point from the left of the screen\n  //at which the first blob should be added\n  const x = spacing * i + xOffset;\n\n  //Give the blob a random `y` position\n  const y = randomInt(0, stage.height - blob.height);\n\n  //Set the blob's position\n  blob.x = x;\n  blob.y = y;\n\n  //Set the blob's vertical velocity. `direction` will be either `1` or\n  //`-1`. `1` means the enemy will move down and `-1` means the blob will\n  //move up. Multiplying `direction` by `speed` determines the blob's\n  //vertical direction\n  blob.vy = speed * direction;\n\n  //Reverse the direction for the next blob\n  direction *= -1;\n\n  //Push the blob into the `blobs` array\n  blobs.push(blob);\n\n  //Add the blob to the `gameScene`\n  gameScene.addChild(blob);\n}\n\n```\n<a id='healthbar'></a>\n#### Making the health bar\n\nWhen you play Treasure Hunter you'll notice that when the explorer touches\none of the enemies, the width of the health bar at the top right\ncorner of the screen decreases. How was this health bar made? It's\njust two overlapping rectangles at exactly the same position: a black rectangle behind, and\na red rectangle in front. They're grouped together into a single `healthBar`\ngroup. The `healthBar` is then added to the `gameScene` and positioned\non the stage.\n```js\n//Create the health bar\nconst healthBar = new Container();\nhealthBar.position.set(stage.width - 170, 4);\ngameScene.addChild(healthBar);\n\n//Create the black background rectangle\nconst innerBar = new Graphics();\ninnerBar.beginFill(0x000000);\ninnerBar.drawRect(0, 0, 128, 8);\ninnerBar.endFill();\nhealthBar.addChild(innerBar);\n\n//Create the front red rectangle\nconst outerBar = new Graphics();\nouterBar.beginFill(0xFF3300);\nouterBar.drawRect(0, 0, 128, 8);\nouterBar.endFill();\nhealthBar.addChild(outerBar);\n\nhealthBar.outer = outerBar;\n```\nYou can see that a property called `outer` has been added to the\n`healthBar`. It just references the `outerBar` (the red rectangle) so that it will be convenient to access later.\n```js\nhealthBar.outer = outerBar;\n```\nYou don't have to do this; but, hey why not! It means that if you want\nto control the width of the red `outerBar`, you can write some smooth code that looks like this:\n```js\nhealthBar.outer.width = 30;\n```\nThat's pretty neat and readable, so we'll keep it!\n\n<a id='message'></a>\n#### Making the message text\n\nWhen the game is finished, some text displays \u201cYou won!\u201d or \u201cYou\nlost!\u201d, depending on the outcome of the game. This is made using a\ntext sprite and adding it to the `gameOverScene`. Because the\n`gameOverScene`\u2018s `visible` property is set to `false` when the game\nstarts, you can\u2019t see this text. Here\u2019s the code from the `setup`\nfunction that creates the message text and adds it to the\n`gameOverScene`.\n```js\nconst style = new TextStyle({\n    fontFamily: \"Futura\",\n    fontSize: 64,\n    fill: \"white\"\n  });\nmessage = new Text(\"The End!\", style);\nmessage.x = 120;\nmessage.y = app.stage.height / 2 - 32;\ngameOverScene.addChild(message);\n```\n<a id='playing'></a>\n### Playing the game\n\nAll the game logic and the code that makes the sprites move happens\ninside the `play` function, which runs in a continuous loop. Here's an\noverview of what the `play` function does\n```js\nfunction play(delta) {\n  //Move the explorer and contain it inside the dungeon\n  //Move the blob monsters\n  //Check for a collision between the blobs and the explorer\n  //Check for a collision between the explorer and the treasure\n  //Check for a collision between the treasure and the door\n  //Decide whether the game has been won or lost\n  //Change the game `state` to `end` when the game is finished\n}\n```\nLet's find out how all these features work.\n\n<a id='movingexplorer'></a>\n### Moving the explorer\n\nThe explorer is controlled using the keyboard, and the code that does\nthat is very similar to the keyboard control code you learnt earlier.\nThe `keyboard` objects modify the explorer\u2019s velocity, and that\nvelocity is added to the explorer\u2019s position inside the `play`\nfunction.\n```js\nexplorer.x += explorer.vx;\nexplorer.y += explorer.vy;\n```\n<a id='containingmovement'></a>\n#### Containing movement\n\nBut what's new is that the explorer's movement is contained inside the walls of the\ndungeon. The green outline shows the limits of the explorer's\nmovement.\n\n![Displaying text](/examples/images/screenshots/28.png)\n\nThat's done with the help of a custom function called\n`contain`.\n```js\ncontain(explorer, {x: 28, y: 10, width: 488, height: 480});\n```\n`contain` takes two arguments. The first is the sprite you want to keep\ncontained. The second is any object with `x`, `y`, `width` and\n`height` properties that define a rectangular area. In this example,\nthe containing object defines an area that's just slightly offset\nfrom, and smaller than, the stage. It matches the dimensions of the dungeon\nwalls.\n\nHere's the `contain` function that does all this work. The function checks\nto see if the sprite has crossed the boundaries of the containing\nobject. If it has, the code moves the sprite back into that boundary.\nThe `contain` function also returns a `collision` variable with the\nvalue \"top\", \"right\", \"bottom\" or \"left\", depending on which side of\nthe boundary the sprite hit. (`collision` will be `undefined` if the\nsprite didn't hit any of the boundaries.)\n```js\nfunction contain(sprite, container) {\n\n  let collision = undefined;\n\n  //Left\n  if (sprite.x < container.x) {\n    sprite.x = container.x;\n    collision = \"left\";\n  }\n\n  //Top\n  if (sprite.y < container.y) {\n    sprite.y = container.y;\n    collision = \"top\";\n  }\n\n  //Right\n  if (sprite.x + sprite.width > container.width) {\n    sprite.x = container.width - sprite.width;\n    collision = \"right\";\n  }\n\n  //Bottom\n  if (sprite.y + sprite.height > container.height) {\n    sprite.y = container.height - sprite.height;\n    collision = \"bottom\";\n  }\n\n  //Return the `collision` value\n  return collision;\n}\n```\nYou'll see how the `collision` return value will be used in the code\nahead to make the blob monsters bounce back and forth between the top\nand bottom dungeon walls.\n\n<a id='movingmonsters'></a>\n### Moving the monsters\n\nThe `play` function also moves the blob monsters, keeps them contained\ninside the dungeon walls, and checks each one for a collision with the\nplayer. If a blob bumps into the dungeon\u2019s top or bottom walls, its\ndirection is reversed. All this is done with the help of a `forEach` loop\nwhich iterates through each of `blob` sprites in the `blobs` array on\nevery frame.\n```js\nblobs.forEach(function(blob) {\n\n  //Move the blob\n  blob.y += blob.vy;\n\n  //Check the blob's screen boundaries\n  const blobHitsWall = contain(blob, {x: 28, y: 10, width: 488, height: 480});\n\n  //If the blob hits the top or bottom of the stage, reverse\n  //its direction\n  if (blobHitsWall === \"top\" || blobHitsWall === \"bottom\") {\n    blob.vy *= -1;\n  }\n\n  //Test for a collision. If any of the enemies are touching\n  //the explorer, set `explorerHit` to `true`\n  if (hitTestRectangle(explorer, blob)) {\n    explorerHit = true;\n  }\n});\n\n```\nYou can see in this code above how the return value of the `contain`\nfunction is used to make the blobs bounce off the walls. A variable\ncalled `blobHitsWall` is used to capture the return value:\n```js\nconst blobHitsWall = contain(blob, {x: 28, y: 10, width: 488, height: 480});\n```\n`blobHitsWall` will usually be `undefined`. But if the blob hits the\ntop wall, `blobHitsWall` will have the value \"top\". If the blob hits\nthe bottom wall, `blobHitsWall` will have the value \"bottom\". If\neither of these cases are `true`, you can reverse the blob's direction\nby reversing its velocity. Here's the code that does this:\n```js\nif (blobHitsWall === \"top\" || blobHitsWall === \"bottom\") {\n  blob.vy *= -1;\n}\n```\nMultiplying the blob's `vy` (vertical velocity) value by `-1` will flip\nthe direction of its movement.\n\n<a id='checkingcollisions'></a>\n### Checking for collisions\n\nThe code in the loop above uses `hitTestRectangle` to figure\nout if any of the enemies have touched the explorer.\n```js\nif (hitTestRectangle(explorer, blob)) {\n  explorerHit = true;\n}\n```\nIf `hitTestRectangle` returns `true`, it means there\u2019s been a collision\nand a variable called `explorerHit` is set to `true`. If `explorerHit`\nis `true`, the `play` function makes the explorer semi-transparent\nand reduces the width of the `health` bar by 1 pixel.\n```js\nif (explorerHit) {\n\n  //Make the explorer semi-transparent\n  explorer.alpha = 0.5;\n\n  //Reduce the width of the health bar's inner rectangle by 1 pixel\n  healthBar.outer.width -= 1;\n\n} else {\n\n  //Make the explorer fully opaque (non-transparent) if it hasn't been hit\n  explorer.alpha = 1;\n}\n\n```\nIf `explorerHit` is `false`, the explorer's `alpha` property is\nmaintained at 1, which makes it fully opaque.\n\nThe `play` function also checks for a collision between the treasure\nchest and the explorer. If there\u2019s a hit, the `treasure` is set to the\nexplorer\u2019s position, with a slight offset. This makes it look like the\nexplorer is carrying the treasure.\n\n![Displaying text](/examples/images/screenshots/29.png)\n\nHere's the code that does this:\n\n```js\nif (hitTestRectangle(explorer, treasure)) {\n  treasure.x = explorer.x + 8;\n  treasure.y = explorer.y + 8;\n}\n```\n<a id='reachingexit'></a>\n### Reaching the exit door and ending the game\n\nThere are two ways the game can end: You can win if you carry the\ntreasure to the exit, or you can lose if you run out of health.\n\nTo win the game, the treasure chest just needs to touch the exit door. If\nthat happens, the game `state` is set to `end`, and the `message` text\ndisplays \"You won\".\n```js\nif (hitTestRectangle(treasure, door)) {\n  state = end;\n  message.text = \"You won!\";\n}\n```\nIf you run out of health, you lose the game. The game `state` is also\nset to `end` and the `message` text displays \"You Lost!\"\n```js\nif (healthBar.outer.width < 0) {\n  state = end;\n  message.text = \"You lost!\";\n}\n```\nBut what does this mean?\n```js\nstate = end;\n```\nYou'll remember from earlier examples that the `gameLoop` is constantly updating a function called\n`state` at 60 times per second. Here's the `gameLoop`that does this:\n```js\nfunction gameLoop(delta) {\n\n  //Update the current game state:\n  state(delta);\n}\n```\nYou'll also remember that we initially set the value of\n`state` to `play`, which is why the `play` function runs in a loop.\nBy setting `state` to `end` we're telling the code that we want\nanother function, called `end` to run in a loop. In a bigger game you\ncould have a `tileScene` state, and states for each game level, like\n`leveOne`, `levelTwo` and `levelThree`.\n\nSo what is that `end` function? Here it is!\n```js\nfunction end() {\n  gameScene.visible = false;\n  gameOverScene.visible = true;\n}\n```\nIt just flips the visibility of the game scenes. This is what hides\nthe `gameScene` and displays the `gameOverScene` when the game ends.\n\nThis is a really simple example of how to switch a game's state, but\nyou can have as many game states as you like in your games, and fill them\nwith as much code as you need. Just change the value of `state` to\nwhatever function you want to run in a loop.\n\nAnd that\u2019s really all there is to Treasure Hunter! With a little more work you could turn this simple prototype into a full game \u2013 try it!\n\n<a id='spriteproperties'></a>\nMore about sprites\n-----------------------------\n\nYou've learnt how to use quite a few useful sprite properties so far, like `x`, `y`,\n`visible`, and `rotation` that give you a lot of control over a\nsprite's position and appearance. But Pixi Sprites also have many more\nuseful properties that are fun to play with. [Here's the full list.](http://pixijs.download/v5.3.10/docs/PIXI.Sprite.html)\n\nHow does Pixi\u2019s class inheritance system work? ([What is a **class**\nand what is **inheritance**? Click this link to find out.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_JavaScript)) Pixi\u2019s sprites are\nbuilt on an inheritance model that follows this chain:\n```\nDisplayObject > Container > Sprite\n```\nInheritance just means that the classes later in the chain use\nproperties and methods from classes earlier in the chain. That means that even though `Sprite` is the last class in the chain, has all the same properties as `DisplayObject` and `Container`, in addition to its own unique properties.\nThe most basic class is `DisplayObject`. Anything that\u2019s a\n`DisplayObject` can be rendered on the stage. `Container`\nis the next class in the inheritance chain. It allows `DisplayObject`s\nto act as containers for other `DisplayObject`s. Third up the chain is\nthe `Sprite` class. Sprites can both be displayed on the stage and be containers for other sprites.\n\n<a id='takingitfurther'></a>\nTaking it further\n-----------------\n\nPixi can do a lot, but it can't do everything! If you want to start\nmaking games or complex interactive applications with Pixi, you'll need\nto use some helper libraries:\n\n- [Bump](https://github.com/kittykatattack/bump): A complete suite of 2D collision functions for games.\n- [Tink](https://github.com/kittykatattack/tink): Drag-and-drop, buttons, a universal pointer and other\n  helpful interactivity tools.\n- [Charm](https://github.com/kittykatattack/charm): Easy-to-use tweening animation effects for Pixi sprites.\n- [Dust](https://github.com/kittykatattack/dust): Particle effects for creating things like explosions, fire\n  and magic.\n- [Sprite Utilities](https://github.com/kittykatattack/spriteUtilities): Easier and more intuitive ways to\n  create and use Pixi sprites, as well adding a state machine and\n  animation player. Makes working with Pixi a lot more fun.\n- [Sound.js](https://github.com/kittykatattack/sound.js): A micro-library for loading, controlling and generating\n  sound and music effects. Everything you need to add sound to games.\n- [Smoothie](https://github.com/kittykatattack/smoothie): Ultra-smooth sprite animation using true delta-time interpolation. It also lets you specify the fps (frames-per-second) at which your game or application runs, and completely separates your sprite rendering loop from your application logic loop.\n\nYou can find out how to use all these libraries with Pixi in the book \n[Learn PixiJS](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781484210956).\n\n<a id='hexi'></a>\n### Hexi\n\nDo you want to use all the functionality of those libraries, but don't\nwant the hassle of integrating them yourself? Use **Hexi**: a complete\ndevelopment environment for building games and interactive\napplications:\n\nhttps://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi\n\nIt bundles the best version of Pixi (the latest **stable** one) with all these \nlibraries (and more!) for a simple and fun way to make games. Hexi also\nlets you access the global `PIXI` object directly, so you can write\nlow-level Pixi code directly in a Hexi application, and optionally choose to use as many or\nas few of Hexi's extra conveniences as you need.\n\n<a id='babylonjs'></a>\n### BabylonJS\n\nPixi is great for 2D, but it can't do 3D. When you're ready to step into the third dimension, the most feature rich, easy-to-use 3D game development platform for the web is [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com). It's a great next step for taking your skills further.\n\n<a id='supportingthisproject'></a>\nPlease help to support this project!\n-------------------\n\nBuy the book! Incredibly, someone actually paid me to finish writing this tutorial\nand turn it into a book! \n\n[Learn PixiJS](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781484210956)\n\n(And it's not just some junky \"e-book\", but a real, heavy, paper book, published by Springer,\nthe world's largest publisher! That means you can invite your friends\nover, set it on fire, and roast marshmallows!!) There's 80% more\ncontent than what's in this tutorial, and it's\npacked full of all the essential techniques you need to know to use\nPixi to make all kinds of interactive applications and games.\n\nFind out how to:\n\n- Make animated game characters.\n- Create a full-featured animation state player.\n- Dynamically animate lines and shapes.\n- Use tiling sprites for infinite parallax scrolling.\n- Use blend modes, filters, tinting, masks, video, and render textures.\n- Produce content for multiple resolutions.\n- Create interactive buttons.\n- Create a flexible drag and drop interface for Pixi.\n- Create particle effects.\n- Build a stable software architectural model that will scale to any size.\n- Make complete games.\n\nAnd, as a bonus, all the code is written entirely in the latest version of\nJavaScript: ES6/2015. And, although the book's code is based on Pixi v3.x, it all works just fine with the latest version of Pixi 4.x!\n\nIf you want to support this project, please buy a copy of this book,\nand buy another copy for your mom!\n\nOr, make a generous donation to: http://www.msf.org\n\n"

The code below appears in `/demos/simple/`.  Open `/demos/simple/index.html` to play.\n\nThe HTML below defines a canvas element and loads in Coquette and the game code.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"../../coquette.js\"></script>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"game.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body><canvas id=\"canvas\"></canvas></body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe game code:\n\n```javascript\nvar Game = function() {\n  this.c = new Coquette(this, \"canvas\", 500, 150, \"#000\");\n\n  // paramour\n  this.c.entities.create(Person, { center: { x:250, y:40 }, color:\"#099\" });\n\n  // player\n  this.c.entities.create(Person, { center: { x:256, y:110 }, color:\"#f07\",\n    update: function() {\n      if (this.c.inputter.isDown(this.c.inputter.UP_ARROW)) {\n        this.center.y -= 0.4;\n      }\n    },\n\n    collision: function(other) {\n      other.center.y = this.center.y; // follow the player\n    }\n  });\n};\n\nvar Person = function(game, settings) {\n  this.c = game.c;\n  for (var i in settings) {\n    this[i] = settings[i];\n  }\n\n  this.size = { x:9, y:9 };\n  this.draw = function(ctx) {\n    ctx.fillStyle = settings.color;\n    ctx.fillRect(this.center.x - this.size.x / 2,\n                 this.center.y - this.size.y / 2,\n                 this.size.x,\n                 this.size.y);\n  };\n};\n\nwindow.addEventListener('load', function() {\n  new Game();\n});\n```\n\n## Demos\n\nFive demos are included in this repository:\n\n* `/demos/spinning-shapes` - an example of collisions between rotated entities.\n* `/demos/racecar` - a 2D racing game.\n* `/demos/box2d-physics` - a game that uses the Box2D physics engine.\n* `/demos/leftrightspace` - a complete game.\n* `/demos/simple` - the example at the top of this readme.\n\n## Reference\n\n### Instantiate Coquette\n\nPass in:\n\n* Your main game object.\n* The ID of the canvas element, e.g. `\"canvas\"`.\n* The desired width of the canvas element.\n* The desired height of the canvas element.\n* The background colour of your game, e.g. `\"#000\"`.\n\n```javascript\nvar YourGame = function() {\n  this.c = new Coquette(this, \"canvas\", 150, 150, \"#000\");\n};\n```\n\n### Modules\n\nWhen you instantiate Coquette, you get an object that has some modules. You can use these modules in your game.\n\n#### Entities\n\nKeeps track of all the entities in the game: the player, enemies, obstacles.\n\n##### Define an entity\n\nMost entities will have these attributes:\n\n* `center`: The center of the entity, e.g. `{ x: 10, y: 20 }`\n* `size`: The size of the entity, e.g. `{ x: 50, y: 30 }`\n* `angle`: The orientation of the entity in degrees, e.g. `30`\n\nAnd these methods:\n\n* `update(timeSinceLastTick)`: Called every tick.  You should change the state of the entity in this method.\n* `draw(canvasCtx)`: Called every tick.  You should draw the entity upright in this method.  The drawing will automatically get rotated to the orientation indicated by `angle`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\nvar Block = function(game, settings) {\n  this.game = game;\n  this.center = settings.center;\n  this.size = settings.size;\n  this.angle = 30;\n};\n\nBlock.prototype = {\n  update: function(timeSinceLastTick) {\n    this.center.x += 0.02 * timeSinceLastTick;\n    this.center.y += 0.02 * timeSinceLastTick;\n  },\n\n  draw: function(canvasCtx) {\n    ctx.fillStyle = \"black\";\n    ctx.fillRect(this.center.x - this.size.x / 2,\n                 this.center.y - this.size.y / 2,\n                 this.size.x,\n                 this.size.y);\n  }\n};\n\n```\n\nSee the Collider section for instructions on enabling collision detection.\n\n##### Create an entity\n\nCall `c.entities.create()` with:\n\n* The constructor function of the entity you want to create, e.g. `Block`.\n* An optional settings object that will be passed into the constructor, e.g. `{ center: { x: 5, y: 10 }, size: { x: 10, y: 30 } }`.\n\nReturns the created entity.\n\n```javascript\nvar Block = function(game, settings) {\n  this.game = game;\n  this.center = settings.center;\n  this.size = settings.size;\n  this.angle = 0;\n};\n\nvar myBlock = c.entities.create(Block, {\n  center: { x: 5, y: 10 },\n  size: { x: 10, y: 30 }\n});\n```\n\n##### Destroy an entity\n\nCall `c.entities.destroy()` with:\n\n* The entity you want to destroy, e.g. `myBlock`.\n\n```javascript\nc.entities.destroy(myBlock);\n```\n\n##### Get all the entities in the game\n\n```javascript\nvar all = c.entities.all();\n```\n\n##### Get all the entities of a certain type\n\n```javascript\nvar invaders = c.entities.all(Invader);\n```\n\n#### Inputter\n\nHandles keyboard and mouse input from the player.\n\n##### Find out if a certain key or mouse button is down\n\n```javascript\nvar leftArrowDown = c.inputter.isDown(c.inputter.LEFT_ARROW);\nvar rightMouseDown = c.inputter.isDown(c.inputter.RIGHT_MOUSE);\n```\n\n##### Find out if a certain key or mouse button is pressed\n\nThis returns true for the tick following the key going down.  In subsequent ticks, it returns false until the key is released and pressed down again.\n\n```javascript\nvar leftArrowPressed = c.inputter.isPressed(c.inputter.LEFT_ARROW);\nvar rightMousePressed = c.inputter.isPressed(c.inputter.RIGHT_MOUSE);\n```\n\n##### Run a function every time the mouse is moved\n\n```javascript\nc.inputter.bindMouseMove(function(position) {\n  console.log(\"The mouse is at\", position.x, position.y);\n});\n```\n\n`position` is relative to the game canvas.  If the mouse pointer is in the top left corner, position will be `{ x: 0, y: 0 }`.\n\n##### Get the current mouse position\n\n```javascript\nvar position = c.inputter.getMousePosition();\n```\n\n`position` is relative to the game canvas.  If the mouse pointer is in the top left corner, position will be `{ x: 0, y: 0 }`.\n\n#### Renderer\n\nHolds the canvas drawing context.  Calls `draw()` on the main game object and all the game entities.\n\n##### Draw an entity\n\nSee the Define an Entity sub-section of the Entities section.\n\n##### Get the canvas drawing context\n\n```javascript\n  var ctx = c.renderer.getCtx();\n  ctx.fillStyle = \"#f00\";\n  ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 10, 10);\n```\n\n##### Set the order that entities are drawn\n\nWhen you create your entities, set an integer `zindex` attribute on them.  An entity with a higher `zindex` will get drawn on top of an entity with a lower `zindex`.  The default `zindex` is `0`.\n\n```javascript\n  var BackgroundTile = function() {\n    this.zindex = -1;\n  };\n\n  var Player = function() {\n    this.zindex = 0;\n  };\n\n  c.entities.create(BackgroundTile, {});\n  c.entities.create(Player, {}); // drawn on top\n```\n\n##### Move the view\n\nYou can use `c.renderer.setViewCenter()` to move the view around the world.  For example, to make the view follow a specific object, you could call `setViewCenter(specificObj.center)` in the `update()` function of your game:\n\n```javascript\n  var Game = function() {\n    var c = new Coquette(this, \"canvas\", 500, 500, \"#000\");\n    var specialObject = c.entities.create(SpecialObject, {});\n\n    this.update = function() {\n      c.renderer.setViewCenter(specialObject.center);\n    };\n  };\n```\n\n#### Collider\n\nReports when entities collide.\n\n##### Entity setup\n\nTo make an entity support collisions, put these attributes on it:\n\n* `center`: The center of the entity, e.g. `{ x: 10, y: 20 }`.\n* `size`: The size of the entity, e.g. `{ x: 50, y: 30 }`.\n* `boundingBox`: The shape that best approximates the shape of the entity, either `c.collider.RECTANGLE` or `c.collider.CIRCLE`.\n* `angle`: The orientation of the entity in degrees, e.g. `30`.\n\nAnd, optionally, this method:\n\n* `collision(other)`: Called when the entity collides with another entity.  Takes `other`, the other entity involved in the collision.\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\nvar Player = function() {\n  this.center = { x: 10, y: 20 };\n  this.size = { x: 50, y: 50 };\n  this.boundingBox = c.collider.CIRCLE;\n  this.angle = 0;\n};\n\nPlayer.prototype = {\n  collision: function(other) {\n    console.log(\"Ow,\", other, \"hit me.\");\n  }\n};\n```\n\n## Run the tests\n\nInstall Node.js and npm: https://github.com/isaacs/npm\n\nInstall the node dependencies and run the tests with:\n\n    $ cd path/to/coquette\n    $ npm install --dev\n    $ npm test\n"

  "readme_contents": "# gdx-gamesvcs\n\nFramework and implementations for using Game Services (BaaS) with libGDX.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MrStahlfelge/gdx-gamesvcs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MrStahlfelge/gdx-gamesvcs)\n![Maven Central](http://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/de.golfgl.gdxgamesvcs/gdx-gamesvcs-core/badge.svg)\n\n![Demo app](/assets/gdxgsgpgs.gif?raw=true \"Demo app\")\n\nWith this extension, you can integrate one or more Game Services in your libGDX games with ease.\nYou can choose the wanted Game Service client in your Launcher classes dynamically.\n\n## Supported game services\n\n* [Google Play Games](https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/gdx-gamesvcs/wiki/Google-Play-Games) (Android, Desktop, HTML5)\n* [Apple Game Center](https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/gdx-gamesvcs/wiki/Apple-Game-Center) (iOS RoboVM)\n* [GameJolt](https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/gdx-gamesvcs/wiki/GameJolt) (all platforms)\n* [Huawei Game Service](https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/gdx-gamesvcs/wiki/Huawei-Game-Service) (Android, since 1.1.0)\n* [Amazon GameCircle](https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/gdx-gamesvcs/wiki/Amazon-GameCircle) (Android)\n* [Kongregate](https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/gdx-gamesvcs/wiki/Kongregate) (HTML5)\n\n\n## Basic concept\n\nThe library provides an interface `IGameServiceClient` that you reference in your core code. Your platform-dependant launchers instantiate an actual implementation of the interface.\n\nEvery implemented game service client has its own project you can decide to include or not. So your game won't get blown up with code you don't need.\n\nThere is a no-op implementation `NoGameServiceClient` provided that does absolutely nothing besides logging your calls. Use it to test platform-independant\nor to avoid `null` checks or NPEs.\nFor testing your UI's behaviour on slow callback responses, you can use `MockGameServiceClient`.\n\nSee the corresponding [demo app](https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/gdx-gamesvcs-app) for an example and this project's wiki for further documentation.\n\n## Working demos\n\nReady to play:\n* Google Play Games: my game [Falling Lightblocks](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.golfgl.lightblocks&referrer=utm_source%3Dgh) is using this lib with GPGS on Android. GPGS on HTML is used by [Secret Chronicles Classic Platformer](https://www.kongregate.com/games/MrStahlfelge/secret-chronicles-classic-platformer) on Kongregate.\n* Apple GameCenter: [Falling Lightblocks](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1453041696), again\n* GameJolt: check out the [HTML5 demo app](http://gamejolt.com/games/gdx-gamesvcs-gj/263351), or web version of my game [Falling Lightblocks](https://gamejolt.com/games/lightblocks/259654)\n* [Kongregate HTML5 demo app](http://www.kongregate.com/games/MrStahlfelge/kongregate-api-for-libgdx-example)\n\nSource examples:\n* [Demo app](https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/gdx-gamesvcs-app)\n* [Falling Lightblocks](https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/lightblocks)\n* [Secret Chronicles Classic](https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/SMC-libgdx)\n\n## Installation\n\nThis project is published to the Sonatype Maven repository. You can integrate the lib \ninto your project by just adding the dependencies to your `build.gradle` file.\n\nDefine the version of this API right after the gdxVersion: \n   \n    gdxVersion = '1.9.8'\n    gamesvcsVersion = '1.1.0'\n\nCore:\n\n    api \"de.golfgl.gdxgamesvcs:gdx-gamesvcs-core:$gamesvcsVersion\"\n    \nFor the HTML5 project, you also have to include the sources\n\n    implementation \"de.golfgl.gdxgamesvcs:gdx-gamesvcs-core:$gamesvcsVersion:sources\"\n\nand add a line to `GdxDefinition.gwt.xml` and `GdxDefinitionSuperdev.gwt.xml`:\n\n    <inherits name=\"de.golfgl.gdxgamesvcs.gdx_gamesvcs_gwt\" />\n\nAfter including the dependencies and refreshing, you can use the `NoGameServiceClient` in your project. For using another Gameservice, add its dependencies according to its [wiki page](https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/gdx-gamesvcs/wiki) or implement your own client against `IGameServiceClient`.\n\n### Building from source\nTo build from source, clone or download this repository, then open it in Android Studio. Perform the following command to compile and upload the library in your local repository:\n\n    gradlew clean publishToMavenLocal\n    \nSee `build.gradle` file for current version to use in your dependencies.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Initializing the game service client\n\nYou should be fine by adding the following lines to your game in order to connect to the service:\n\nMain game class:\n\n    public IGameServiceClient gsClient;\n    \n    @Override\n    public void create() {\n        // ...awesome initialization code...\n        \n        if (gsClient == null)\n            gsClient = new NoGameServiceClient();\n\n        // for getting callbacks from the client\n        gsClient.setListener(this);\n\n        // establish a connection to the game service without error messages or login screens\n        gsClient.resumeSession();\n        \n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public void pause() {\n        super.pause();\n\n        gsClient.pauseSession();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void resume() {\n        super.resume();\n\n        gsClient.resumeSession();\n    }\n\nIn the launcher class you instantiate and initialize the GameServiceClient for the service you want to use:\n\n        DesiredGameserviceClient gsClient = new DesiredGameserviceClient();\n\n        gsClient.initialize( game service dependant initialization parameters );\n\n        myGdxGame.gsClient = gsClient;\n\nInitialization depends on the game service; see the [wiki pages](https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/gdx-gamesvcs/wiki) on how to instantiate the included Game Service clients.\n\nAs you see, you assign the game service client dynamically here - so it is no problem to support different game services with only a single build of your game.\n\nIf you want to know if you established a connection to a user session, you can use \n`gsClient.isSessionActive()`, or set a listener and wait for the call to \n`gsOnSessionActive()`. You don't need to check if a user session is active for \nsubmitting scores, events and unlocking achievements, as some game services allow anonymous\nor guest submits. The API client implementations do all needed checks.\n\n### Submitting events and scores, unlocking achievements\n\nYou can feed your players by unlocking achievements and posting scores to leaderboards really easy:\n\n    gsClient.submitToLeaderboard(leaderboardId, score, tag);\n    \n    gsClient.unlockAchievement(achievementId);\n    \nEvents are interesting for you as a developer.     \n    \n    gsClient.submitEvent(eventId, 1);\n\nPlease note: It depends of the game services which calls can be processed without a user session. The API client implementations deal with that so you don't have to.  \n\n### Cloud save\n\nNot every game service and client implementation supports cloud save, check the overview table in the wiki. In your game, you can and must check the availability by calling\n\n    if (gsClient.isFeatureSupported(GameServiceFeature.GameStateStorage))\n\nIf you ensured that cloud save feature is available, use these methods to invoke it:    \n\n    gsClient.loadGameState(fileId, new ILoadGameStateResponseListener() {...});\n\n    gsClient.saveGameState(fileId, gameState, progressValue, \n                           new ISaveGameStateResponseListener() {...});\n\nThe methods perform an ansynchronous operation and call your listener afterwards.\n\n\n### Fetching scores and achievement status\n\nThe interface provides a method for open up an API's default leaderboard or achievment UI:\n\n    gsClient.providesAchievementsUI();\n    gsClient.showAchievements();\n    // same for leaderboards\n\nDefault UI is provided by all game services, so you need to check with `gsClient.isFeatureSupported()` before calling.\n\nFetching scores and achievement status to show in your own UI can be done by calling\n     \n     gsClient.fetchLeaderboardEntries(...)\n     gsClient.fetchAchievements(...)\n     \nafter checking\n    \n     gsClient.isFeatureSupported(GameServiceFeature.FetchLeaderBoardEntries)\n     gsClient.isFeatureSupported(GameServiceFeature.FetchAchievements))\n\nYou give a listener as a parameter which will be called with a list of achievement or leader board \nentries in response. See to the JavaDocs or the demo application for more information.\n\n### Explicit log in and out\nSome game services support user sign in and out, some need the user to log in manually for the first time. Use the game service interface's `logIn()` and `logOut()` methods for doing so. These methods should only be called when the user manually requested an explicit log in/out. \n\nNote: For Google Play Games your game even *must* provide a sign in/out button to be considered Google Play Games Services-compatible.\n\n## News & Community\n\nYou can get help on the [libgdx discord](https://discord.gg/6pgDK9F).\n\n## License\n\nThe project is licensed under the Apache 2 License, meaning you can use it free of charge, without strings attached in commercial and non-commercial projects.

  "readme_contents": "dopresskit\n==========\n\npresskit() - spend time making games, not press.\n\n\nSimple. Fast. Free.\n==========\nDevelopers & press both have the same goal: to bring great games to as many people as possible - after all, a good game is worth nothing if no-one plays it. For the press, finding out about a game but not having access to information & media for the game means that they can't write about it. Of course, developers want to spend their valuable time making games instead of press pages.\n\npresskit() (pronounced 'do presskit') is the solution. Free for everyone, open and easy-to-use for both developers & press. Developers only have to spend an hour or so creating well-laid out press pages with everything the press needs to write to their hearts desire. Everybody wins.\n\n\nWhat is presskit()?\n==========\nBeautiful, optimized and efficient press pages in 30-60 minutes.\nUsable by anyone who knows what FTP, text editing & image editing means.\nFast & painless 'Single File Upload'-installation.\nCreated using feedback of prominent journalists & indie developers.\nOptional, seamless integration with Promoter & Google Analytics\nWhat does beta mean?\n\npresskit() is currently in beta, which means that all functionality is in there, but not everything has been tested. It also means that I officially take no responsibility for your presskit()-installation whatsoever. While I've tested it extensively and presskit() is incapable of damaging, deleting or modifying anything above its root installation directory, it might suddenly stop working, have some rough patches or not do exactly what you want. That's part of the deal.\n\n\nWhat is new in presskit()?\n==========\npresskit() is currently in beta, which means new functions get added every now and then. Since its launch in early May, a lot of functions have been added. The manual has info on anything listed here that is not explained. These functions have been added recently:\n\nEasily monitor who mentions you in the press with Promoter and embed awards and reviews that Promoter finds with a single click.\nIntegrate easily with Google Analytics to keep track of who, when and from where visits to your presskit() are made.\nEnable or disable the press request section of a project by adding a <can-request-press-copy> tag set to FALSE.\nYou have a specific wish, idea or feedback? Get in touch at rami@vlambeer.com or at @tha_rami!\n\n\nWhy is presskit() free?\n==========\nThe goal of creating presskit() was to save myself and the people in the press that want to write about Vlambeer as much time as possible.\n\nAs development of presskit() furthered, an increasing amount of fellow independent game creators asked about how easy it was to implement. This convinced me that this little project could make life easier for a lot more people than just myself.\n\npresskit(), in the spirit of independent developers helping eachother out when it comes to making games or doing business, is completely free for anyone to use.\n\n\npresskit() was only possible thanks to these fine folks!\n==========\n\npresskit() was created in just over a week by Rami Ismail of Dutch independent game studio Vlambeer. Rami does the business & development at Vlambeer and found himself looking for an efficient solution to press kits. presskit() was the result, but it wouldn't have been if it weren't for the following fine folks:\n\nAndreas Zecher - Made by Pixelate - for the original inspiration that made me create this kit.\nJan Willem Nijman - Vlambeer - for starting Vlambeer with me, which eventually led to this thing.\nRuss Frushtick - Polygon - for general feedback from a press-person point-of-view.\nMartin Jonasson - grapefrukt - for challenging me to a race to see who could write the most efficient install script.\nJoram Wolters - JoramWolters.com - for his always sharp critique on game & web design and functionality.\nJan Pieter van Seventer - Dutch Game Garden - for support & feedback.\nAdriaan de Jongh - gameovenstudios.com - for distractions and meaningful Skype-conversations during presskit()s development.\nPhilip Tibitoski - octodadgame.com - for inspiring me to make this publically available.\n\nThe indie community at large for being amazing, open-minded, supportive, creative and interesting people.\nFriends, family & girlfriend for allowing & supporting me to do what I love to do, to pursue my dreams and to make games.\n"

  "readme_contents": "# GamesTestAutomationExample\nExamples and libraries for (Unity3d) mobile game automation testing. This was started as a project for a hack day but the information and unity packages here might be useful for real game projects.\n\n## Purpose\nMobile game automation testing is tricky, the purpose of this project is to provide game developers and QA personel with ideas, examples and libraries which can aid in setting up test automation for a game project.\n\n### Starting point of this project\n- [appium](http://appium.io/) can handle device communication for both Android and iOS\n  - This includes installing apps, screenshotting, sending touch-events and reading logs\n\n### Problem with image recognition\nFor game test automation on mobile, the go-to solution is often to use image recognition (e.g. [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)) to identify captured screenshots or assets are visible on screen. This works in some cases but comes with a lot of problems:\n- Games should be tested during development, the assets of the game keep changing and it is a hassle to keep them up to date.\n- Managing different versions of assets for different versions (Android, iOS, free, paid, HD) will lead to confusion about which version should be used in which test.\n- Mobile devices have different resolutions and screen aspects, so the image comparison needs to deal with scaling\n- Image comparison algorithms are slow for the currently large resolutions of devices\n- Animated assets cause problems\n- Taking screenshots is slow\n- Using a VNC-solution will cause latency and artifacts\n- etc...\n\n### Problem #1 Verifying that something occured in game\nThe easiest way to communicate information from the game to the tests scripts is to read them from log. Logcat for Android or syslog for iOS. In Unity3d you can do this simply by using the [Debug class](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html). If you have a lot of information you need to read from the game to the test-scripts you can use a standard format such as [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). The [itest-niacin](github.com/Applifier/itest-niacin) libraries used in this repository can handle the JSON parsing in your tests scripts.\n\n### Problem #2 Verifying that something is rendered correctly\nImage recognition can be made much more robust for this. For a faster implementation consider using [QR-codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code), there are good, fast QR-code reading libraries which allows you to quickly find if your scene/sprite/object was rendered correctly and visible for the player. Please keep in mind that QR-codes are designed with error correction which enables it to be read even with only a part of the QR-code visible.\nTODO: Examples and libs with QR-codes\n\n### Problem #3 Finding UI-elements and Gameobjects on screen.\nFor native UI-elemnents of both Android and iOS this is solved by the platform and you can use Appium to find elements on screen. For games this gets more difficult as the platform cannot help you find the elements. \nA solution which will work for many cases (especially menus and 2D games) is to instument the game to write positions of the elements/objects into the device log. Once again using a standard format such as JSON is recommended. \n\nSee description below in `Use in your own project` on how to integrate the Unity-asset and test libraries into your game project to implement this.\n\n## Usage\n### To run example tests using the example-app\n- Install [Android Debug Bridge](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html)\n- Install [appium](http://appium.io/) 1.4.16\n- Connect an Android device or use emulator\n- Start appium server\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/UnityTech/GamesTestAutomationExample\ncd GamesTestAutomationExample/tests\n./run-tests-android.sh\n```\n\n### Use in your own project\n![](http://i.imgur.com/Cbos0J9.gif)\n- Download the file `example-unity-project/AutomationHelpers.unitypackage` from this repository and drag to your unity project\n![](http://i.imgur.com/02sruZr.gif)\n- Drag the `ObjectLogger`-prefab from the folder `Assets/AutomationHelpers/Prefabs` into root of your project\n- Open the `ObjectLogger`-Gameobject in inspector and drag the Gameobject you wish to use in your test in appropriate fields\n  - `Logged Objects`-fields should be populated with typical Gameobjects\n  - `Ui menu Object`-field can be populated with a UI-object (unity 5+)\n\n## Contributing to project\n\n### Build .unityproject from command line\n\nExample of building from command line (Mac - you might have to change Unity path).

Make sure your game has mobile support, and does not require a login or registration\n2. Add an API to your game that create a new room/lobby when called\n3. Copy `config/games/_template.ts` and fill it out for your game\n4. ...that's pretty much it. Submit a PR!!! If you'd like more detail, keep reading!\n\n### What's a \"rocket crab\"???\n\nRocketcrab makes it easy for players to discover your game, and easily switch to and from your game without having to manually open a different website and enter a new game code. It accomplishs this by putting your game's page into an `iframe`, which allows any of your cookies, local storage, analytics, and advertising to continue working, while disallowing rocketcrab from manipulating your site. Integrating your game with rocketcrab should be a simple process, but please let me know by opening an issue or joining our Discord if there is any way it could be better!\n\nThe name Rocketcrab is the first thing I could think of that sounded cool, had an available `.com` domain, and could be represented by two emojis. It also does not have an ambigious spelling when spoken out loud (there's only one way to spell \"rocket\" and \"crab\"), which is important when trying to get your whole group to go to the site to play games!\n\nGames are added to rocketcrab via config files located [here](https://github.com/tannerkrewson/rocketcrab/tree/dev/config/games). By looking at the config files of other games, you might be able to understand how other games implement rocketcrab, and how you might integrate rocketcrab into your game. Here's what you need to know:\n\n### Ensuring compatability\n\nRocketcrab works by opening your game in an `iframe` on all of the players' devices. At minimum, for your game to work with rocketcrab, there must be:\n\n-   A way for rocketcrab to generate a new party via either:\n    -   an API that rocketcrab can hit (eg. `https://yourgame.com/api/creategame`, which returns the generated game code, like `abcd`)\n    -   generating a random id that your game will accept as a valid room code\n-   A way to construct a link to join a game using that game code (eg. `https://yourgame.com/abcd` will be opened on every player's browser, resulting in them all being in the same game together)\n\nThat's it! Many existing games already offer these, and can work with rocketcrab without any changes! But, to make the experience of playing your game with rocketcrab even better, you may need to make a few minor changes, explained in the \"The automatic query params\" section below.\n\n### Creating a config file\n\nThe config files, as mentioned above, should be fairly self explanatory. Along with the [config template](https://github.com/tannerkrewson/rocketcrab/blob/dev/config/games/_template.ts), check out the config files of other games to see how they implement rocketcrab. The most important part, which will be explained here, is the `connectToGame` function. This function:\n\n-   is `async`, which will allow you to use `await` to make `GET` or `POST` requests.\n-   needs to return an object with these properties:\n    -   `player` (required) an object with these properties:\n        -   `url` (required) string of the url that should be opened in every player's `iframe`.\n            -   `customQueryParams` (optional) a record of query params in addition to or to replace the automatic query params.\n            -   `afterQueryParams` (optional) string that will be appended to the `player.url` after automatic and custom query params are applied.\n    -   `host` (optional) an object with these properties:\n        -   `url` (optional) string of a url to be opened only in the \"host\" player's `iframe`. If not provided, the `url` from the `player` object will be used.\n            -   `customQueryParams` (optional) same as `player` object, but only applied to the host.\n            -   `afterQueryParams` (optional) same as `player` object, but only applied to the host.\n    -   These properties are explained more in depth in the [config template](https://github.com/tannerkrewson/rocketcrab/blob/dev/config/games/_template.ts).\n\nHere are two examples of different `connectToGame` functions:\n\n-   For [Spyfall](https://github.com/tannerkrewson/rocketcrab/blob/ba2a9f05d9d85af440b603436f6280bc92c0087e/config/games/spyfall.ts#L42-L48), game links are required to take the format `spyfall.tannerkrewson.com/abcd`. So, instead of returning the game code from `connectToGame` in the `code` property, the game code is directly appended to the `player.url` before it is returned from `connectToGame`.\n-   For [Just One](https://github.com/tannerkrewson/rocketcrab/blob/ba2a9f05d9d85af440b603436f6280bc92c0087e/config/games/justone.ts#L33-L40), we can pick our own game code! So, instead of calling to some endpoint to get a game code like Drawphone and Spyfall, the `connectToGame` function can itself generate a code, and we cross our fingers and hope it's unique! \ud83d\ude02 The resulting `player.url` will look something like this: `https://just1.herokuapp.com/room/rocketcrab-d5b30ccdd25855e5`.\n\n### The automatic query params\n\nThe `player.url` returned from `connectToGame` is automatically appended with 3 query params. The resulting `player.url` that is opened in every player's `iframe` will look something like this:\n\n```\nhttps://yourgame.com/?rocketcrab=true&name=Mary&ishost=true\n```\n\n-   `rocketcrab` will always be true, well, if you're using rocketcrab, that is! \ud83d\ude02 You can use this to put your game into a \"rocketcrab\" mode. Here are some ideas for how this could be helpful:\n    -   Rocketcrab itself has it's own game code system, so if your game prominentely displays its own game code, your players may be confused. If `rocketcrab=true`, you should hide any UI in your game that shows the game code!\n    -   You should also hide any \"Play on \ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd80\" buttons (see the next section), because if `rocketcrab=true`, they're already playing with on rocketcrab! \ud83d\ude02\n-   `name` is a string of the name that each player has entered into rocketcrab. Use this instead of asking for your players' names a second time!\n-   `ishost` is `true` for the one player that is the host of the rocketcrab party, and `false` for all other players. A few caveats:\n    -   I included this in case some one needed it, but implementing this in your game could allow any player that knows about it to make themselves host, especially outside of rocketcrab, so I don't recommend it.\n    -   In Drawphone, for example, the first player who joins a party is made the host. So, rocketcrab will load the host's `iframe` first, and will wait a few seconds before opening the `iframe` of the rest of the players. This is not a guaranteed solution, as the `iframe` API does not allow rocketcrab to know when its page has loaded.\n-   There used to be an automatic `code` parameter for the game code. This was removed in favor of using a custom query param, detailed further in the template.\n\n### \ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd80 for your existing players\n\nIf your game already has a player base, our goal is to make rocketcrab just as easy, if not easier, to use than how they already play. Rocketcrab is also a great way for your players to discover new games, which helps developers with no players yet find players for their games! So, we will want to make the process of discovering and jumping into a rocketcrab party from your game's existing lobby as painless as possible! Here's two features of rocketcrab to help:\n\n-   Place a button on the homepage of your game that links to `https://rocketcrab.com/transfer/[your game's id here]/`.\n    -   This will place the user in a new rocketcrab party with your game already selected!\n    -   Your game's ID is the `id` that is set for your game in its config file. For example, Drawphone's [is `drawphone`](https://github.com/tannerkrewson/rocketcrab/blob/00c36ef3b133d01f74969c14d5271461853325fb/config/games/drawphone.ts#L5), so the link would look like `https://rocketcrab.com/transfer/drawphone/`.\n-   Place a button in the party of your game that, when clicked by one player, will transfer all players to `https://rocketcrab.com/transfer/[your game's id here]/[insert a uuid here]`.\n    -   The first time this link is followed, it will create a new rocketcrab party. Any subsequent time it is followed, it will place users into the same rocketcrab party that was created with the same `uuid`.\n    -   Again, for the most seamless experience, when any player clicks the button, your game should automatically redirect all players in the lobby to this link right away.\n    -   The uuid should be unique to each lobby in your game, but the same for each player in the lobby.\n    -   To generate the uuid, [this uuid package](https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid) would be best, but any very long random string will do.\n    -   An example of a link for Drawphone: `https://rocketcrab.com/transfer/drawphone/9b1deb4d-3b7d-4bad-9bdd-2b0d7b3dcb6d/`\n    -   Make sure you hide this button if the players are using you game through rocketcrab, or else they could do [this](https://i.imgur.com/MXanVTG.jpg)!\n\nFor an example of both of these buttons in action, check out [snakeout.tannerkrewson.com](https://snakeout.tannerkrewson.com/). [Here's](https://github.com/tannerkrewson/snakeout/commit/6845cbb199b7269abcc7d7829c63c5c6ac2179f9) what the code looked like for them.\n\n## \ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd80 Behind the scenes\n\nThis is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) using the [`with-typescript-eslint-jest`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/v9.4.4/examples/with-typescript-eslint-jest) template, which includes:\n\n-   [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)\n-   Linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)\n-   Formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)\n-   Linting, typechecking and formatting on by default using [`husky`](https://github.com/typicode/husky) for commit hooks\n-   Testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [`react-testing-library`](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)\n\n### Getting Started\n\nFirst, run the development server:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.\n\nYou can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`.

  "readme_contents": "# How to make money with short web games\n\nHello! A bit of context, I'm Felipe (nyunesu), and I made a living in 2019 out of web games. Here I'll teach you how I did that and how you can do it to.\n\n\n\n## What this isn't about\n\nFirst of all, let me clarify what this isn't about:\n\n- .io games\n- ads\n- multiplayer\n- large games\n\nHere I'll mention what I have experience with so I can guide you through the path I made, and hopefully that will be useful for you.\n\n\n\n## Licensing\n\nLicensing is selling the rights of a website to host your game, usually comes in form of a flat fee.\n\nThere are two types of licensing: exclusive and non-exclusive.\n\nAs the name says one allows you to sell and monetize your games with other websites while the other doesn't. Sometimes the exclusive licensing is referred to as Sponsorship.\n\n\n\n## The right kind of games\n\nThere's no \"right\" or \"wrong\" in here, I'll provide the information I have and the way that I think you can benefit the most from it. Please don't take anything that I say for granted, try it and adapt in a way that will work better for you.\n\nI've reached out to **Cool Math Games** and **Armor Games** and asked them directly about their interests.\n\n### Expectations\n\n- Be clear how to play\n  *Write it in the e-mail or even inside the game -- This should be clear to the curator and also the player*\n- Let them know if there are any strategies that will make the game more enjoyable\n  *Also let them know before they play it*\n- Shouldn't be too difficult in the first two minutes\n  *It's okay to ramp up the difficulty later on, but at least at the start it shouldn't be too challenging*\n\n### Specifics\n\nOne more time, this is just to maximize your revenue from the websites I will list, some of them might be look for some specifics while other doesn't care.  Those tips here are to maximize your reach among all available licensors out there.\n\n- PC-First games\n  *Think of your game controls for PC players before anything else, it's okay to port your controls to reach a mobile later, but they shouldn't be your primary target*\n- Mid-Hardcore games\n  *It doesn't mean that they don't have interest in soft core or hypercasual experiences, it's just that it's not their focus*\n- Skill-based gameplay\n  *Look for something that exercises the player's brain in some sort of level, strategic-thinking, hand-eye coordination, problem-solving and so on...*\n- Uniqueness\n  *Having a clone of a game there is already in their website won't get you anywhere. Make sure if your game has a commonly used mechanic, you have something that tell apart from the other games*\n- Universe\n  *Spend some time thinking about your game's universe, even if there are no text or dialog try to come up with an interesting looking character or setting. The players will fill in the blanks.*\n- Ending\n  *If your game has an end, make it rewarding or at least surprising, completing things is awesome, so congratulate the player for that.*\n- SFW & Violence\n  *Take it easy on the amount of violence, and also make sure you game stays SFW.*\n\n\n\n## Pitching\n\n**The first price you negotiate with a licensor will set your cost as a developer.**\n\nThis is true for you and for them. It'll be hard for them to lower it, as you can say you sold the other games for X and you want the same. It will also be hard for you to increase - unless the games are substantially different - since it's likely that they'll use the same argument with you.\n\nWhen negotiating with Addicting Games for the first time, our conversation was similar to this:\n\n```\nMe: Hey, would be interested in this game for $900?\nAG: Sorry, we only pay $300 for those type of games\nMe: Oh, that's unfortunate, even if I lower it down to $700?\nAG: I can raise the offer for you to $400\nMe: $600?\nAG: Let's me in the middle, $500!\nMe: Deal!\n```\n\nI sent two extra emails for $200, sounds like a great deal to me. More than ever, this was the first negotiation, that means that all my other games were sold for $500, I sold them 4 games so that means I got $800 for 2 emails. That's how important your first negotiation is.\n\n### How to Pitch\n\nIt's not that complicated, all you need is a clear description of your game, a web build that includes and the things mentioned above in **[Expectations]**.\n\nHere's an example of how a first pitching email looks like:\n\n```\nTo: person.or.company@company.com\nSubject: Game Opportunity - [Game Name]\n\nHi [Person or Company],\n\nI've made this new game called [Game Name] and I'd like to know if you'd be interested in bringing this to your platform.\n\nIt's a [Game Genere] in [Context] where you [Something unique about the game].\n\n[--Embeded GIF--]\n\nYou can play it here:\n[Web build URL]\n\nI'd like to know if you'd interested in a [type of licensing you're looking for] deal.\n\n(-- Optional START --)\nI've estimated around $XXX for this game's non-exclusve license. \n(-- Optional END --)\n\nPlease let me know if that would be possible.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n```\n\nIf you prefer to hear their offer first, it's up to you. As long as you're not rude or demanding it's okay to offer the price you think it's fair (maybe a bit above) and then haggle for a bit. The worst answer you're going to get is that the price is too high or out of their budget.\n\nYou can also ask them afterwards if they would be interested in exclusivity or paying more for the game to be release in their website first, some sites do that.\n\n\n\n## Piracy\n\nIt's pretty easy to pirate a game in the web, so you should at least take precautions of shady websites hosting your game without rights to do it.\n\nAll I can provide to you is a Unity script for anti piracy, since that's all I have, but I'm pretty sure you can find more out there.\nYou should not forget to import my \"External.jslib\" file from https://github.com/nyunesu/PNLib/blob/main/Plugins/External.jslib in your project, under the plugins special folder, in order to run my anti piracy script fine.\n\n```cs\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Runtime.InteropServices;\nusing System.Text;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class AntiPiracy : MonoBehaviour\n{\n\t[SerializeField]\n\tprivate string[] allowedHosts =\n\t{\n\t\t\"itch.io\",\n\t\t\"newgrounds.com\",\n\t\t\"ungrounded.net\",\n\t\t\"kongregate.com\",\n\t\t\"konggames.com\",\n\t\t\"itch.zone\",\n\t\t\"v6p9d9t4.ssl.hwcdn.net\",\n\t\t\"file://\",\n\t\t\"localhost\",\n\t\t\"127.0.0.1\",\n\t};\n\n\tprivate const string RedirectURL = \"https://i.giphy.com/media/lgcUUCXgC8mEo/giphy.webp\";\n\n\tprivate void Start()\n\t{\n\t\tif (!Application.isEditor)\n\t\t\tValidateURL();\n\t}\n\n\t[DllImport(\"__Internal\")]\n\tprivate static extern void ExternalEval(string str);\n\n\tprivate void ValidateURL()\n\t{\n\t\tValidateURLWithJavaScript();\n\n\t\tif (IsValidURL(allowedHosts) == false)\n\t\t\tRedirect();\n\t}\n\n\tprivate static void Redirect()\n\t{\n\t\tApplication.OpenURL(RedirectURL);\n\t}\n\n\tprivate static bool IsValidURL(IEnumerable<string> urls)\n\t{\n\t\treturn urls.Any(url => Application.absoluteURL.ToLower().Contains(url));\n\t}\n\n\tprivate static string CompileHosts(IReadOnlyList<string> allowedUrLs)\n\t{\n\t\tStringBuilder urls = new StringBuilder();\n\n\t\tfor (int i = 0; i < allowedUrLs.Count; i++)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\turls.Append(\"(document.location.host.includes('\");\n\t\t\tstring url = allowedUrLs[i];\n\n\t\t\tif (url.IndexOf(\"http://\", StringComparison.Ordinal) == 0)\n\t\t\t\turl = url.Substring(7);\n\t\t\telse if (url.IndexOf(\"https://\", StringComparison.Ordinal) == 0)\n\t\t\t\turl = url.Substring(8);\n\n\t\t\turls.Append(url);\n\t\t\turls.Append(\"'))\");\n\n\t\t\tif (i < (allowedUrLs.Count - 1))\n\t\t\t\turls.Append(\" && \");\n\t\t}\n\n\t\treturn urls.ToString();\n\t}\n\n\tprivate void ValidateURLWithJavaScript()\n\t{\n\t\tStringBuilder javascriptTest = new StringBuilder();\n\t\tjavascriptTest.Append(\"if (\");\n\t\tjavascriptTest.Append(\"(document.location.host != 'localhost') && (document.location.host != '')\");\n\n\t\tif (allowedHosts.Length > 0)\n\t\t\tjavascriptTest.Append(\" && \");\n\n\t\tjavascriptTest.Append(CompileHosts(allowedHosts));\n\t\tjavascriptTest.Append(\"){ document.location='\");\n\t\tjavascriptTest.Append(RedirectURL);\n\t\tjavascriptTest.Append(\"'; }\");\n\t\tExternalEval(javascriptTest.ToString());\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n\n\n## Contacts & Info\n\nThose are the most reliable websites for someone making games in Unity for PC.

This occurs frequently when clients correct for prediction errors and must move a player controller to match the authoritative server's position. Volatile is largely stateless -- very little trajectory data is preserved between frames aside from the position, orientation, and angular/linear velocity of each body.\n- **Individual Object Ticking.** Objects can be ticked individually without forcing a tick on the entire physics world. This is useful for client-side prediction in networked games. Ticking objects individually is more efficient, but may cause duplicate collisions if more than one object is handled this way.\n- **History Tracking.** Volatile can store historical state for dynamic objects and perform tests on an object's past world position. This is useful for lag compensation with raycast weapons in networked shooters.\n- **Simplicity.** Volatile is designed to be simple to read and debug. This library offers as minimal a feature set as possible to keep the total source small and readable.\n\nCaveats:\n- Volatile is designed primarily for *dynamic-static* object collisions (like a character colliding with world geometry). *Dynamic-dynamic* object collisions are supported, but resolving them is difficult to synchronize over any network simulation if each body has a different client owner. Volatile provides no explicit support for synchronizing dynamic object collisions over a network.\n- Volatile has low frame coherence compared to most physics engines due to potential network rollbacks and corrections. Because of this, efficient spatial decomposition techniques are non-trivial, and the engine would benefit less from caching techniques like warm starting. In complex systems, Volatile's convergence will be outperformed by more sophisticated physics solvers, but Volatile should still be sufficient for many game applications.\n- Volatile currently does not use broadphase spatial decomposition (like an octree or dynamic tree). Several implementation attempts exist in the commit history, but these data structures failed to significantly improve performance in evaluation. Spatial decomposition is notably more complicated in Volatile than in other engines due to Volatile's built-in support for storing and querying historical world states.\n\n---\n\nBy default, Volatile builds against the official UnityEngine.dll and uses Unity data structures (like Vector2). Volatile includes a separate \"FakeUnity\" project that emulates Unity's functionality to the extent Volatile needs. You can add this project as a reference and remove the UnityEngine.dll reference to build Volatile as a standalone library. It is safe to delete FakeUnity if you are not interested in using Volatile outside of Unity."

Go into dnSpy, then in the top, select `Debug` -> `Start Debugging` and select `Unity` as the debug engine.\n2. Then, for the executable, select your game's executable\n3. And in the `Arguments` box, add `--melonloader.debug` and any other arguments you want\n4. Finally, to add breakpoints, simply drag and drop the mod you want to debug into dnSpy's Assembly Explorer, then add breakpoints regularly.\n\nYou can read more about attaching the dnSpy debugger in the [MelonLoader wiki](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/modders/debugging).\n\n---\n\n## START SCREEN CUSTOMIZATION:\n\n- After Initial Launch the Start Screen will create a folder under `UserData/MelonStartScreen`\n- Inside this folder it will create a `Themes` folder and a `Config.cfg` file for Customization Settings.\n- You can also place Custom Themes in the created `Themes` folder.\n- Inside `Config.cfg` you can set what Theme folder you would like to use.  \n- If you set your Theme folder to `Random` it will randomly pick and load from existing Themes.  \n\n- For Custom Themes you can place Custom Images in their Theme folder to further customize it.\n- Listed below are the Compatible File Names and Extensions for the Custom Images.\n\n| Compatible File Names |\n| - |\n| Background |\n| Loading |\n| Logo |\n\n| Compatible Extensions |\n| - |\n| .gif |\n| .png |\n| .jpg |\n| .jpeg |\n\n---\n\n## LAUNCH OPTIONS:\n\n- These are additional Launch Options that MelonLoader adds to the Game.\n- These can be used to manipulate how MelonLoader works.\n\n| Argument | Description |\n| - | - |\n| --no-mods | Launches the Game without loading any Plugins or Mods |\n| --quitfix | Fixes the Hanging Process Issue with some Games |\n| --melonloader.consolemode | Changes the Theme Display Mode of the Console [ Default = 0 ] |\n| --melonloader.consoleontop | Forces the Console to always stay on-top of all other Applications |\n| --melonloader.consoledst | Keeps the Console Title as Original |\n| --melonloader.hideconsole | Hides the Console |\n| --melonloader.hidewarnings | Hides Warnings from Displaying |\n| --melonloader.debug | Debug Mode |\n| --melonloader.dab | Debug Analytics Blocker |\n| --melonloader.maxlogs | Max Log Files [ Default: 10 ] [ NoCap: 0 ] |\n| --melonloader.maxwarnings | Max Warnings per Log File [ Default: 100 ] [ NoCap: 0 ] [ Disabled: -1 ] |\n| --melonloader.maxerrors | Max Errors per Log File [ Default: 100 ] [ NoCap: 0 ] [ Disabled: -1 ] |\n| --melonloader.loadmodeplugins | Load Mode for Plugins [ Default: 0 ] |\n| --melonloader.loadmodemods | Load Mode for Mods [ Default: 0 ] |\n| --melonloader.agfoffline | Forces Assembly Generator to Run without Contacting the Remote API |\n| --melonloader.agfregenerate | Forces Regeneration of Assembly |\n| --melonloader.agfvunity | Forces Assembly Generator to use a Specified Version of Unity Dependencies |\n| --melonloader.agfvdumper | Forces Assembly Generator to use a Specified Version of Dumper |\n| --melonloader.agfvunhollower | Forces Assembly Generator to use a Specified Version of Il2CppAssemblyUnhollower |\n| --melonloader.agfregex | Forces Assembly Generator to use a Specified Regex |\n| --melonloader.basedir | Changes the Proxy's Load Directory for the Bootstrap |\n| --melonloader.disablestartscreen | Disable the Start Screen |\n| --melonloader.disableunityclc | Disable Unity Console Log Cleaner | \n\n---\n\n## LOAD MODES:\n\n- Load Mode Launch Options are a way to dictate how you want Mods or Plugins to Load.\n- Below is the Compatible Values and what each of them do.\n\n| Value | Action |\n| - | - |\n| 0 | Load Only if the File doesn't have the \".dev.dll\" Extension |\n| 1 | Load Only if the File has the \".dev.dll\" Extension |\n| 2 | Load All |\n\n---\n\n## CONSOLE DISPLAY MODES:\n\n- Console Display Modes are built in Themes for the Console\n- Below is the Compatible Values and what each of them do.\n\n| Value | Mode |\n| - | - |\n| 0 | Normal |\n| 1 | Magenta |\n| 2 | Rainbow |\n| 3 | Random Rainbow |\n\n---\n\n## PROXIES:\n\n- The Proxy DLL is able to be Renamed to the Compatible File Names below.\n- By Default the Proxy is named as \"version.dll\".\n- For most Unity Games the Default File Name should work perfectly fine.\n- Some Unity Games may have you use a different Proxy File Name depending on the Architecture, Operating System, version of the Unity Engine used by the Game, etc.\n\n| File Names: |\n| - |\n| psapi.dll |\n| version.dll |\n| winhttp.dll |\n| winmm.dll |\n\n---\n\n## LICENSING & CREDITS:\n\nMelonLoader is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

  "readme_contents": "# How to make money with short web games\n\nHello! A bit of context, I'm Felipe (nyunesu), and I made a living in 2019 out of web games. Here I'll teach you how I did that and how you can do it to.\n\n\n\n## What this isn't about\n\nFirst of all, let me clarify what this isn't about:\n\n- .io games\n- ads\n- multiplayer\n- large games\n\nHere I'll mention what I have experience with so I can guide you through the path I made, and hopefully that will be useful for you.\n\n\n\n## Licensing\n\nLicensing is selling the rights of a website to host your game, usually comes in form of a flat fee.\n\nThere are two types of licensing: exclusive and non-exclusive.\n\nAs the name says one allows you to sell and monetize your games with other websites while the other doesn't. Sometimes the exclusive licensing is referred to as Sponsorship.\n\n\n\n## The right kind of games\n\nThere's no \"right\" or \"wrong\" in here, I'll provide the information I have and the way that I think you can benefit the most from it. Please don't take anything that I say for granted, try it and adapt in a way that will work better for you.\n\nI've reached out to **Cool Math Games** and **Armor Games** and asked them directly about their interests.\n\n### Expectations\n\n- Be clear how to play\n  *Write it in the e-mail or even inside the game -- This should be clear to the curator and also the player*\n- Let them know if there are any strategies that will make the game more enjoyable\n  *Also let them know before they play it*\n- Shouldn't be too difficult in the first two minutes\n  *It's okay to ramp up the difficulty later on, but at least at the start it shouldn't be too challenging*\n\n### Specifics\n\nOne more time, this is just to maximize your revenue from the websites I will list, some of them might be look for some specifics while other doesn't care.  Those tips here are to maximize your reach among all available licensors out there.\n\n- PC-First games\n  *Think of your game controls for PC players before anything else, it's okay to port your controls to reach a mobile later, but they shouldn't be your primary target*\n- Mid-Hardcore games\n  *It doesn't mean that they don't have interest in soft core or hypercasual experiences, it's just that it's not their focus*\n- Skill-based gameplay\n  *Look for something that exercises the player's brain in some sort of level, strategic-thinking, hand-eye coordination, problem-solving and so on...*\n- Uniqueness\n  *Having a clone of a game there is already in their website won't get you anywhere. Make sure if your game has a commonly used mechanic, you have something that tell apart from the other games*\n- Universe\n  *Spend some time thinking about your game's universe, even if there are no text or dialog try to come up with an interesting looking character or setting. The players will fill in the blanks.*\n- Ending\n  *If your game has an end, make it rewarding or at least surprising, completing things is awesome, so congratulate the player for that.*\n- SFW & Violence\n  *Take it easy on the amount of violence, and also make sure you game stays SFW.*\n\n\n\n## Pitching\n\n**The first price you negotiate with a licensor will set your cost as a developer.**\n\nThis is true for you and for them. It'll be hard for them to lower it, as you can say you sold the other games for X and you want the same. It will also be hard for you to increase - unless the games are substantially different - since it's likely that they'll use the same argument with you.\n\nWhen negotiating with Addicting Games for the first time, our conversation was similar to this:\n\n```\nMe: Hey, would be interested in this game for $900?\nAG: Sorry, we only pay $300 for those type of games\nMe: Oh, that's unfortunate, even if I lower it down to $700?\nAG: I can raise the offer for you to $400\nMe: $600?\nAG: Let's me in the middle, $500!\nMe: Deal!\n```\n\nI sent two extra emails for $200, sounds like a great deal to me. More than ever, this was the first negotiation, that means that all my other games were sold for $500, I sold them 4 games so that means I got $800 for 2 emails. That's how important your first negotiation is.\n\n### How to Pitch\n\nIt's not that complicated, all you need is a clear description of your game, a web build that includes and the things mentioned above in **[Expectations]**.\n\nHere's an example of how a first pitching email looks like:\n\n```\nTo: person.or.company@company.com\nSubject: Game Opportunity - [Game Name]\n\nHi [Person or Company],\n\nI've made this new game called [Game Name] and I'd like to know if you'd be interested in bringing this to your platform.\n\nIt's a [Game Genere] in [Context] where you [Something unique about the game].\n\n[--Embeded GIF--]\n\nYou can play it here:\n[Web build URL]\n\nI'd like to know if you'd interested in a [type of licensing you're looking for] deal.\n\n(-- Optional START --)\nI've estimated around $XXX for this game's non-exclusve license. \n(-- Optional END --)\n\nPlease let me know if that would be possible.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n```\n\nIf you prefer to hear their offer first, it's up to you. As long as you're not rude or demanding it's okay to offer the price you think it's fair (maybe a bit above) and then haggle for a bit.

This occurs frequently when clients correct for prediction errors and must move a player controller to match the authoritative server's position. Volatile is largely stateless -- very little trajectory data is preserved between frames aside from the position, orientation, and angular/linear velocity of each body.\n- **Individual Object Ticking.** Objects can be ticked individually without forcing a tick on the entire physics world. This is useful for client-side prediction in networked games. Ticking objects individually is more efficient, but may cause duplicate collisions if more than one object is handled this way.\n- **History Tracking.** Volatile can store historical state for dynamic objects and perform tests on an object's past world position. This is useful for lag compensation with raycast weapons in networked shooters.\n- **Simplicity.** Volatile is designed to be simple to read and debug. This library offers as minimal a feature set as possible to keep the total source small and readable.\n\nCaveats:\n- Volatile is designed primarily for *dynamic-static* object collisions (like a character colliding with world geometry). *Dynamic-dynamic* object collisions are supported, but resolving them is difficult to synchronize over any network simulation if each body has a different client owner. Volatile provides no explicit support for synchronizing dynamic object collisions over a network.\n- Volatile has low frame coherence compared to most physics engines due to potential network rollbacks and corrections. Because of this, efficient spatial decomposition techniques are non-trivial, and the engine would benefit less from caching techniques like warm starting. In complex systems, Volatile's convergence will be outperformed by more sophisticated physics solvers, but Volatile should still be sufficient for many game applications.\n- Volatile currently does not use broadphase spatial decomposition (like an octree or dynamic tree). Several implementation attempts exist in the commit history, but these data structures failed to significantly improve performance in evaluation. Spatial decomposition is notably more complicated in Volatile than in other engines due to Volatile's built-in support for storing and querying historical world states.\n\n---\n\nBy default, Volatile builds against the official UnityEngine.dll and uses Unity data structures (like Vector2). Volatile includes a separate \"FakeUnity\" project that emulates Unity's functionality to the extent Volatile needs. You can add this project as a reference and remove the UnityEngine.dll reference to build Volatile as a standalone library. It is safe to delete FakeUnity if you are not interested in using Volatile outside of Unity."

This is where most changes should be made for features, bug fixes, UI, etc.\n* <tt>editions/</tt> - Assembly directories for each \"flavor\" of ScratchJr. These symlink to src for common code, and could diverge in settings and assets.\n  * <tt>free/</tt> - Free edition JavaScript, including all shared code for all releases\n* <tt>android/</tt> - Android port of Scratch Jr. (Java, Android Studio Projects)\n  * <tt>ScratchJr/</tt> - Android Studio Project for ScratchJr Android Application\n* <tt>bin/</tt> - Build scripts and other executables\n* <tt>doc/</tt> - Developer Documentation\n* <tt>ios/</tt> - Xcode project for iOS build. (Make sure to open <tt>ScratchJr.xcworkspace</tt> not <tt>ScratchJr.xcodeproj</tt>)\n\n## Building ScratchJr\n\n### Initial setup\n\nRegardless of whether you are doing iOS development or Android development, you should do these steps.\n\n*These instructions assume you are building both versions on Mac OSX, with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) installed.*\n\n1. Clone or update the code for this repo\n2. Ensure you have node and npm [installed](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).\n3. Run <tt>sudo easy_install pysvg</tt> to install python svg libraries\n4. Run <tt>brew install librsvg</tt> to install commandline `rsvg-convert`\n5. Run <tt>brew install imagemagick</tt> to install commandline `magick`\n6. In the top level of the scratchjr repo directory, install npm dependencies for bundling the JavaScript: <tt>npm install</tt>\n\n### Analytics\nScratchJr uses the Firebase SDK to record analytics for the app. Scratch Team developers should look for\nthe configuration files in the Scratch Devs Vault. If you're not on the Scratch Team, then you'll need to\nset up your own [app analytics](https://firebase.google.com/products/analytics) with Google Firebase. It's free. Firebase will generate the configuration files for you to download.\n\n1. Place the `google-services.json` file in `editions/free/android-resources`\n2.

BitMemory/DoubleMemory/FloatMemory/IntMemory: getIndex(i:Int): memory byte offset for value at index i\n- code style: different 'friend' syntax that ensures strict typing for improved performance (<http://www.weblob.net/2010/01/friend-types-are-slow-really>)\n- modified: Graph: added maxSize() constraint() for debugging\n\n### 1.05 (released 2009-12-24)\n\n- all: interfaces can be accessed in swc files\n- all: parameter names are now available in swc files\n- all: switched from flash.Vector to Array for now because a dynamic array (used in swc files) is faster than a dynamic vector and alchemy memory is much faster than typed number vectors.\n- all: iterators now implement de.polygonal.ds.Itr\\<T\\> (to distinguish between the built-in Iterator typedef)\n- all: iterators can be reused by calling iterator.reset() when typed to ResettableIterator\\<T\\> or Itr\\<T\\>\n- all: enhanced assign(): collection can be filled entirely/partially with elements\n- all: enhanced shuffle(): now accepts external random values so different RNG/PRNG can be used.\n- all: enhanced Collection.toArray() and Collection.toVector()\n- all: minor documentation improvements\n- added:

  "readme_contents": "generator-phaser\n=================\n\nA [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator to create HTML5 games with [Phaser](http://phaser.io/). This generator allows for the creation of Phaser games with best practices. The main generator (`yo phaser`) outputs a basic Phaser game. You can also generate new prefabs (`yo phaser:prefab`) or states (`yo phaser:state`) to add to your project.\n\nYou can view your game in the browser by running `npm start` from the project's root directory and the web page will refresh as you save your files.\n\nWhen you are ready to publish, build your game with `npm run build` and view the output in the `build/` folder. The build process minifies and compresses individual files into one file for faster network downloading, the source code is transpiled to ES5 compatible JavaScript using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS**\n\n+ Install [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org)\n\n+ Install the required npm modules by issuing these commands:\n\n  `npm install -g yo generator-phaser`\n\n+ Create a new directory for your game:\n  + Unix/OSX : `mkdir ~/Desktop/mygame && cd $_`\n  + Windows  : `mkdir %USERPROFILE%\\Desktop\\mygame && cd %USERPROFILE%\\Desktop\\mygame`\n\n+ Invoke the generator:\n\n  `yo phaser`\n\n+ Invoke the state generator (Note: this updates & overwrites `main.js`):\n\n  `yo phaser:state`\n\n+ Invoke the prefab generator:\n\n  `yo phaser:prefab`\n\n+ Invoke the shader generator:\n\n  `yo phaser:shader`\n\n+ Run a local development server (livereload enabled) with this command:\n\n  `npm start`\n\n+ Package your game (i.e. minify css, html and js) with:\n\n  `npm run build`\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe game's `main.js` file will be updated with new states when you run the state generator.\nIt adds in .js files found in the `src/states/` directory.\n\n**CREDITS**\n\n+ [@photonstorm](https://github.com/photonstorm/) for creating\n  [Phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser).\n\n+ The guys behind [yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman).\n\n+ [Gulp.js](http://www.gulpjs.com)\n\n+ [Ben Alman](http://benalman.com/) for [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)\n\n+ [Keney.nl](http://kenney.nl/assets/shooting-gallery) for the default game's images, [erkanozan](https://www.freesound.org/people/erkanozan/sounds/51749/) for gunshot audio,  [iut_Paris8](https://www.freesound.org/people/iut_Paris8/sounds/88243/) for 'ding' audio\n\n+ All other repo contributors\n"

You can use these methods to make almost any\nkind of 2D action or arcade game.\n\n(Important! this library targets Pixi v3.0.11, which is the most stable version of Pixi, and is the only version I can recommend using. This library will eventually be upgraded for Pixi v4 when the v4 branch matures.)\n\n[Setting up](#settingup) <br>\n[Using Bump's collision methods](#using) <br>\n[Hit](#hit): A universal collision detection method <br>\n[hitTestPoint](#hittestpoint): Check whether a point is intersecting a sprite <br>\n[hitTestCircle](#hittestcircle): Check whether 2 circles are touching <br>\n[circleCollision](#circlecollision): Bounce a moving circle against a stationary circle <br>\n[movingCircleCollision](#movingcirclecollision): Bounce two moving circles apart <br>\n[hitTestRectangle](#hittestrectangle): Check whether two rectangular or square sprites are touching <br>\n[rectangleCollision](#rectanglecollision): Prevent two rectangular sprites from intersecting <br>\n[hitTestCircleRectangle](#hittestcirclerectangle): Check whether a rectangular and circular sprite are touching<br>\n[circleRectangleCollision](#circlerectanglecollision): Bounce a circular sprite against a rectangular sprite <br>\n[contain](#contain): Contain a sprite inside the boundaries of another rectangular sprite <br>\n\n<a id=\"settingup\"></a>\nInstalling and setting up Bump\n------------------------------\n\nUse a `<script>` tag to link the `bump.js` file to your HTML document.\n```\n<script src=\"bump.js\"></script>\n```\n(If you prefer, you can load `bump.js` using any JavaScript module\nsystem you might be familiar working with: ES6 modules, SystemJS, AMD or CommonJS.) \nThe Bump source files contain both ES5 and ES6 versions of the\n`bump.js` code. You should probably use the ES5 version for production\ncode.\n\nNext, create a new instance of Bump at the beginning of your program.\nSupply the renderer you want to use in the constructor (the defautl is `PIXI`) like this:\n```\nb = new Bump(PIXI);\n```\nThe variable `b` (for \"bump\", of course!) now represents the running\ninstance of Bump that you can use to access all of Bump\u2019s collision methods.\n\n<a id=\"using\"></a>\nUsing Bump's collision methods\n------------------------------\n\nUsing Bump is just a matter of choosing the collision method you want to\nuse, and applying it based on the examples ahead. Just append `b` (or\nwhatever variable name you chose for the Bump instance) to the\nbeginning of each method, like this:\n```js\nb.hitTestRectangle(spriteOne, spriteTwo);\n```\nHere are all the collision methods you can use:\n\n<a id=\"hit\"></a>\n###`hit`\n\n`hit` is a universal collision function. It automatically detects the\nkinds of sprites that are being used in the collision and chooses the\nappropriate collision function for you. This means that instead of\nhaving to remember which of the many collision functions in Bump's\nlibrary to use, you only need remember one: `hit`.\n\nIn its simplest form, you can use `hit` like this: \n```\nhit(spriteOne, spriteTwo)\n```\nIt will return `true` if the sprites are touching and `false` if they\naren't.\nAnd that\u2019s all you need to know to start making some truly captivating games!\n\nThe sprites can be circles or rectangles. Bump's methods assumes\nthey're rectangular by default. But if you want the methods to\ninterpret a sprite as circular, give it a `circular` property and set\nit to `true`.\n```js\nanySprite.circular = true;\n```\nIf you want the sprites to react to the collision, so that they don\u2019t\nintersect, set the third argument to `true`. \n```js\nhit(spriteOne, spriteTwo, true)\n```\nThis prevents them from overlapping, so it's useful for making walls,\nfloors, or any other kind of solid boundary.\n\nIf you want the sprites to bounce apart, set the fourth argument to `true`. \n```js\nhit(spriteOne, spriteTwo, true, true)\n```\nNow your sprites will bounce!\n\nSetting the fifth argument to `true`  makes the `hit` method  use the\nsprites\u2019 **global coordinates**.\n```\nhit(spriteOne, spriteTwo, true, true, true)\n```\nThe global coordinates are the sprites positions relative to the\ncanvas's top left corner, instead of the top left corner of their\nparent container (their local coordinates.)\n\nIf you want to check a point object for a collision against a sprite, use the point as the first argument,\nlike this:\n```js\nhit({x: 145, y:65}, sprite)\n```\nA point object is just any object with two properties, `x` and `y`, that\ndefine the point's position.\n\nThe `hit` method also lets you check for a collision between a sprite and an array of sprites. Just include\nthe array as the second argument. In this example the array is called\n`bricks.children`:\n```js\nhit(ball, bricks.children, true, true, true);\n```\nYou'll see that `hit` automatically loops through all the sprites in\nthe array for you and checks them against the first sprite. This means\nyou don\u2019t have to write your own `for` loop or `forEach` loop.\n\nThe `hit` function also returns a collision object, with a return\nvalue that matches the kinds of sprites you\u2019re checking. For example, \nif both sprites are rectangles, you could find the side on which the collision occurred like this:\n```js\nlet collision = hit(rectangleOne, rectangleTwo, true);\nmessage.text = \"collision side: \" + collision;\n```\n`collision` will always be `undefined` if there\u2019s no collision.\n\nA final feature is that you can use an optional callback function as\nthe sixth argument. This lets you inject some extra code that should \nrun when the collision occurs. This is especially useful for checking a \ncollision between a single sprite and an array of sprites. If there\u2019s a \ncollision, the callback will run, and you can access both the collision \nreturn value and the sprite involved in the collision. Here\u2019s how you \ncould use this feature to check for a collision between a sprite\ncalled `player` and an array of sprites in an array called `world.platforms`:\n```js\nlet playerVsPlatforms = hit(\n  player, \n  world.platforms, \n  true, false, false, \n  function(collision, platform){\n\n    //`collision` tells you the side on player that the collision occurred on.\n    //`platform` is the sprite from the `world.platforms` array\n    //that the player is colliding with\n  }\n);\n```\nThis is a compact way of doing complex collision checks that gives you a \nlot of information and low-level control but saves you from having to \nmanually loop through all the sprites in the array.\n\nHowever, the `hit` method is just a high-level wrapper for Bump's many\nlower level collision methods. If you prefer to use the lower-level\nmethods, they're all listed next.\n\n<a id=\"hittestpoint\"></a>\n###`hitTestPoint`\n\nThe most basic collision test is to check whether a point is\nintersecting a sprite. `hitTestPoint` will help you to figure this out. \n`hitTestPoint` takes two arguments: a point object with `x` and `y`\nproperties, and a sprite:\n```js\nhitTestPoint(\n  {x: 128, y: 128},  //An object with `x` and `y` properties \n  anySprite          //A sprite\n)\n```\n`hitTestPoint` will return `true` if the point intersects the sprite,\nand `false` if it doesn\u2019t. \n\nThe `hitTestPoint` method works equally well with rectangular and \ncircular sprites. If the sprite has a `radius` property, `hitTestPoint` \nassumes that the sprite is circular and applies a point collision detection \nalgorithm for circles. If the sprite doesn\u2019t have a `radius` property, the \nmethod assumes it is a square. You can give any sprite a `radius`\nproperty. An easy way to do this is to give the sprite a `circular` property and set\nit to `true`.\n```js\nanySprite.circular = true;\n```\nThe sprite will now be interpreted as circular and have a new `radius`\nproperty which is equal to half the sprite's width.\n\n<a id=\"hittestcircle\"></a>\n###`hitTestCircle`\n\nIf you want to check for a collision between two circular sprites, \nuse the `hitTestCircle` method: \n```js\nhitTestCircle(sprite1, sprite2)\n```\nUse it with any sprite that has a `radius` property. It returns `true` \nif the circles are touching, so you can use it with an `if` statement to check for a \ncollision, like this:\n```js\nif (hitTestCircle(sprite1, sprite2)) {\n  //The circles are touching\n}\n```\n\n<a id=\"circlecollision\"></a>\n###`circleCollision`\n\nIf a moving circle hits a non-moving circle, you can create a collision \nreaction using the `circleCollision` method:\n```js\ncircleCollision(circle1, circle2, true);\n```\nThis stops the circles from intersecting.\n\nThe first argument is the moving ball, and the second is the\nnon-moving ball. The third argument is an optional Boolean that\ndetermines whether the first circle should bounce off the second. (The\nBoolean will default to `false` if you leave it out, so if you want the\ncircles to bounce, set it to `true`. You probably want to do this!)\n\nThere's an optional fourth argument that, if you set it to `true`,\nmakes the method use the sprites\u2019 global coordinates. This is important \nif you want to check for collisions between sprites that have different \nparent containers.\n\n<a id=\"movingcirclecollision\"></a>\n###`movingCircleCollision`\n\nYou can create a collision reaction between two moving circles using \nthe `movingCircleCollision` method. Supply two circular sprites as arguments:\n```js\nmovingCircleCollision(circle1, circle2)\n```\nIf the circles have a `mass` property, that value will be used to help \nfigure out the force with which the circles should bounce off each other.\nThe `movingCircleCollision` method makes the sprites bounce apart by default.\nAn important feature of this method is that when two moving circles collide, \nthey transfer their velocities to each other in a way that makes them bounce \napart very realistically. \n\n#### Checking for multiple collisions\n\nIf you have a bunch of moving circles, like marbles,\nyou need to check for a collision between each of them on every frame\nof your game loop. To do this you need to make sure that no pair of marbles \nis checked for collisions with each other more than once. The key to making \nthis work is to use a nested `for` loop and to start the counter of the inner \nloop by one greater than the outer loop. Here\u2019s some example code that\nusing the `movingCircleCollision` method to make an array of marbles bounce off \neach other (the marble sprites are in an array called\n`marbles.children`):\n```js\nfor (let i = 0; i < marbles.children.length; i++) {\n\n  //The first marble to use in the collision check\n  var c1 = marbles.children[i];\n  for (let j = i + 1; j < marbles.children.length; j++) {\n\n    //The second marble to use in the collision check\n    let c2 = marbles.children[j];\n\n    //Check for a collision and bounce the marbles apart if they collide\n    movingCircleCollision(c1, c2);\n  }\n}\n```\nYou can see that the inner loop starts at a number that\u2019s one greater than the outer loop:\n```js\nlet j = i + 1\n```\nThis prevents any pair of objects from being checked for collisions more than once.\n\nThe Bump library also has a convenience method called\n`multipleCircleCollision` that automates this entire nested for loop for you. \nYou can use it in a game loop to check all the sprites in an array with all the \nother sprites in the same array, without duplication. Use it like this:\n```js\nmultipleCircleCollision(marbles.children)\n```\nIt will automatically call `movingCircleCollision` on each pair of sprites to make \nthem bounce off one another. You now know most of the important techniques you need \nto make a wide range of games using circular sprites.\n\n<a id=\"hittestrectangle\"></a>\n###`hitTestRectangle`\n\nTo find out whether two rectangular sprites are overlapping, use a function called \n`hitTestRectangle`:\n```js\nhitTestRectangle(rectangle1, rectangle2)\n```\n`hitTestRectangle` returns `true` if the rectangles overlap, and\n`false` if they don't. You can use it in a simple collision test like\nthis:\n```js\nif (hitTestRectangle(rectangle1, rectangle2)) {\n  //The rectangles are touching\n} else {\n  //They're not touching\n}\n```\n\n<a id=\"rectanglecollision\"></a>\n###`rectangleCollision`\n\n`rectangleCollision` make the rectangles behave as though they have\nsolid mass. It prevents any of the rectangular sprites in its first \ntwo arguments from overlapping:\n```js\nrectangleCollision(rectangle1, rectangle2)\n```\n`rectangleCollision` also returns a string, whose value may be \"left\", \n\"right\", \"top\", or \"bottom\", that tells you which side of the first \nrectangle touched the second rectangle. You can assign the return \nvalue to a variable and use the information in your game. Here\u2019s how:\n```js\nlet collision = rectangleCollision(rectangle1, rectangle2);\n\n//On which side of rectangle1 is the collision occuring?\nswitch (collision) {\n  case \"left\":\n    message.text = \"Collision on left\";\n    break;\n  case \"right\":\n    message.text = \"Collision on right\";\n    break;\n  case \"top\":\n    message.text = \"Collision on top\";\n    break;\n  case \"bottom\":\n    message.text = \"Collision on bottom\";\n    break;\n  default:\n    message.text = \"No collision...\";\n}\n```\n`collision` has a default value of `undefined`.\nThis example code will prevent the rectangles from overlapping and\ndisplays the collision side in a text sprite called `message`.\n\nThe `rectangleCollision` method has a very useful side effect. \nThe second sprite in the argument has the ability to push the first \nsprite out of the way. If you need to add a block-pushing or \ntile-sliding feature to a game, use this feature.\n\n`rectangleCollision` has a third, optional Boolean argument, `bounce`: \n```js\nrectangleCollision(rectangle1, rectangle2, true)\n```\nIf `bounce` is `true`, it makes the first sprite bounce off the second \nsprite when they collide. Its default value is `false`. (As with the all \nthe other collision methods, you should set the final optional argument, \n`global`, to `true` if you want to use the sprites\u2019 global coordinates.)\n\n<a id=\"hittestcirclerectangle\"></a>\n###`hitTestCircleRectangle`\n\n`hitTestCircleRectangle` checks for a collision between a circular and\nrectangular sprite. The first argument is the circular sprite, and the \nsecond is the rectangular sprite:\n```js\nlet collision = hitTestCircleRectangle(ball, box);\n```\nIf they\u2019re touching, the return value (collision) will tell you where \nthe circle is hitting the rectangle. It can have the value \"topLeft\", \n\"topMiddle\", \"topRight\", \"leftMiddle\", \"rightMiddle\", \"bottomLeft\", \n\"bottomMiddle\", or \"bottomRight\". If there\u2019s no collision it will be\n`undefined`.\n\n<a id=\"circlerectanglecollision\"></a>\n###`circleRectangleCollision`\n\nUse `circleRectangleCollision` to make a circle bounce off a square\u2019s sides or corners:\n```js\ncircleRectangleCollision(ball, box, true);\n```\nSetting the optional third argument to `true` makes the sprites bounce apart, \nand setting the fourth argument to `true` tells the method to use the \nsprites\u2019 global coordinates.\n\n<a id=\"contain\"></a>\n###`contain`\n\n`contain` can be used to contain a sprite with `x` and\n`y` properties inside a rectangular area.\n\nThe `contain` function takes four arguments: a sprite with `x` and `y`\nproperties, an object literal with `x`, `y`, `width` and `height` properties. The \nthird argument is a Boolean (true/false) value that determines if the sprite\nshould bounce when it hits the edge of the container. The fourth argument\nis an extra user-defined callback function that you can call when the\nsprite hits the container. (Only the first two arguments are required.)\n```js\ncontain(anySprite, {x: 0, y: 0, width: 512, height: 512}, true, callbackFunction);\n```\nThe code above will contain the sprite's position inside the 512 by\n512 pixel area defined by the object. If the sprite hits the edges of\nthe container, it will bounce. The `callBackFunction` will run if \nthere's a collision.\n\nAn additional feature of the `contain` method is that if the sprite\nhas a `mass` property, that value will be used to dampen the sprite's bounce\nin a natural looking way.\n\nIf the sprite bumps into any of the containing object's boundaries,\nthe `contain` function will return a Set of string values that tells you which side\nthe sprite bumped into: \u201cleft\u201d, \u201ctop\u201d, \u201cright\u201d or \u201cbottom\u201d. Here's how\nyou could keep the sprite contained and also find out which boundary\nit hit:\n```js\n//Contain the sprite and find the collision value\nlet collision = contain(anySprite, {x: 0, y: 0, width: 512, height: 512});\n\n//If there's a collision, display the boundary that the collision happened on\nif(collision) {\n  if collision.has(\"left\") console.log(\"The sprite hit the left\");  \n  if collision.has(\"top\") console.log(\"The sprite hit the top\");  \n  if collision.has(\"right\") console.log(\"The sprite hit the right\");  \n  if collision.has(\"bottom\") console.log(\"The sprite hit the bottom\");  \n}\n```\nIf the sprite doesn't hit a boundary, the value of\n`collision` will be `undefined`. \n\n\n"

However, my intent is that it should eventually become stable enough for use as a reliable substitute for a model-predictive control backend.\n\n## Paper\nFor a full description of the algorithm itself and examples of how it can be applied in collision-avoidance problems, please refer to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04694), which was presented at ICRA 2020.\n\nIf you find this repository useful, please do cite the paper:\n```\n@inproceedings{fridovich2020efficient,\n  title={Efficient iterative linear-quadratic approximations for nonlinear multi-player general-sum differential games},\n  author={Fridovich-Keil, David and Ratner, Ellis and Peters, Lasse and Dragan, Anca D and Tomlin, Claire J},\n  booktitle={2020 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)},\n  pages={1475--1481},\n  year={2020},\n  organization={IEEE}\n}\n```\nIf you are interested in the feedback linearized version of this algorithm, please also refer to that [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00681), which is also published at ICRA 2020:\n```\n@inproceedings{fridovich2020iterative,\n  title={An iterative quadratic method for general-sum differential games with feedback linearizable dynamics},\n  author={Fridovich-Keil, David and Rubies-Royo, Vicenc and Tomlin, Claire J},\n  booktitle={2020 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)},\n  pages={2216--2222},\n  year={2020},\n  organization={IEEE}\n}\n```\n\n## Primary contributor\nThe primary contributor is [David Fridovich-Keil](https://dfridovi.github.io), a recent PhD grad from Claire Tomlin's group in the EECS department at UC Berkeley. David is currently an assistant professor at UT Austin. The best way to contact David is by email, _dfk at utexas dot edu_, or if you have specific questions about this repository, please post an [issue](https://github.com/HJReachability/ilqgames/issues).\n\n## Documentation\nDocumentation is automatically generated by a continuous integration service with each push to the `master` branch, and it may be found [here](https://HJReachability.github.io/ilqgames/documentation/html/). Additionally, a more high-level form of documentation is available in PDF form [here](https://github.com/HJReachability/ilqgames/blob/master/ILQGames_Documentation.pdf).\n\n## Language\nAn early version of the iterative linear-quadratic game algorithm was implemented in Python; it is now deprecated and stored in the `python/` directory. Ongoing and future development will proceed primarily in C++, although a colleague has built a standalone version in Julia [here](https://github.com/lassepe/iLQGames.jl)\n\n## Dependencies\n*ilqgames* has been tested both in OS X and Ubuntu. Depending on your version of Ubuntu, you may notice a linker error related to `aclocal-XX`, which may be fixed by symlinking Ubuntu's native `aclocal` to the desired executable `aclocal-XX`. Otherwise, external dependencies are standard:\n\n* `glog` (Google's logging tools)\n* `gflags` (Google's command line flag tools)\n* `opengl`, `glut` (graphics tools)\n* `eigen3` (linear algebra library)\n\n## Getting started\nThis repository uses the `cmake` build system and may be compiled following standard cmake protocols:\n```\nmkdir build && cd build\ncmake ..\nmake -j8\n```\n\nExecutables will be stored in the `bin/` directory, with the exception of `build/run_tests`, which runs unit tests. To run unit tests from the build directory, simply execute:\n```\n./run_tests\n```\n\nTo run a particular example from the `bin/` directory, e.g., the three-player intersection:\n```\n./three_player_intersection\n```\n\nWith any executable, a full explanation of command line arguments can be found by running:\n```\n./<name-of-executable> --help\n```\n\n## Extending *ilqgames*\n### New examples\nAll specific examples, e.g. the three-player intersection, inherit from the base class `Problem`. This base class provides a number of utilities, such as warm starting, and also wraps the solver. To inherit, simply write a constructor which instantiates the appropriate solver with costs, and also set the initial state, operating point, and strategies. To see an example, consult the [ThreePlayerIntersectionExample](https://github.com/HJReachability/ilqgames/blob/master/src/three_player_intersection_example.cpp) class.\n\n### ROS\nThere is a companion ROS extension under development, which may be found [here](https://github.com/HJReachability/ilqgames_ros). It is currently still marked private, but rest assured that the usage of the *ilqgames* toolbox in ROS is straightforward! If you want to implement this yourself for a custom application it is not too hard.\n\n### GUI\nThe native *ilqgames* graphical user interface can be a very useful tool in debugging algorithm changes, new costs, etc. Currently, it supports so-called `TopDownRenderableProblem` games, where the state encodes x-y position and (potentially) heading information. To extend the GUI to other types of games, simply write a custom renderer, e.g. mirroring the `TopDownRenderer` class. All GUI functionality is based on the [DearImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) library, a copy of which is maintained locally in the `external/` directory.\n"

And, most important, describe the install mechanics in more detail.\n\n- **Install**: create a decent `setup.py`, possibly uploading to Pypi\n\n- **Classes**: convert the games and bundles dictionaries to classes with attributes and methods. `HumbleBundle.get_game()` would return a `Game` instance, methods `.install()`, `.download()` etc would be there and not on the \"main\" HumbleBundle class.\n\nIf you find a bug or have any enhancement request, please to open a [new issue](https://github.com/MestreLion/humblebundle/issues/new)\n\n\nWritten by\n----------\n\nRodrigo Silva (MestreLion) <linux@rodrigosilva.com>\n\nLicenses and Copyright\n----------------------\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 Rodrigo Silva (MestreLion) <linux@rodrigosilva.com>.\n\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>.\n\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\n\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\n"

What does that mean?**\nTransparent compression means that files can still be used normally on the computer as if nothing had happened - they don't get repackaged like Zip and Rar files do. \n\n**How is this different from the built-in compression in older versions of Windows?**\nThis is similar to the NTFS-LZNT1 compression built-in to Windows (Right click > Properties > Compress to save space) however the newer algorithms introduced in Windows 10+ are far superior, resulting in greater compression ratios with almost no performance impact.Those with older HDDs may even see a decent performance gain in the form of reduced loading times as the smaller files means it takes less time to read programs and games into RAM.

With any modern CPU (I have tested as old as an i3-370M from 2010 with negligible impact), this added load is hardly noticed, and the space savings are of most use on those with smaller SSDs. \n\nAs program folders and games can be shrunk by up to 60%, this has the added bonus of potentially reducing load times - especially on slower HDDs. \n\nMore information on the inbuilt Windows function can be found [here](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-au/library/bb490884.aspx) and [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh920921(v=vs.85).aspx) or by typing `compact /q` into the commandline\n\nThis tool is intentionally designed to only compress folders and files. Whole drives and entire Windows installations cannot be modified from within CompactGUI - users seeking that functionality should use `compact /compactOS` from the commandline. \n\nThe compression is fully transparent - programs, games and files can still be accessed as normal, and show up in Explorer as they normally would \u2014 they'll just be decompressed into RAM at runtime, staying compressed on disk.\n\n## Options\nBy default, the program runs Compact with the `XPRESS8K` algorithm active. This provides a good balance between compression speed and size reduction. The default that Windows uses is `XPRESS4K` which is faster but compresses less. \nThe options available are: \n- XPRESS4K: Fastest, but weakest\n- XPRESS8K: Reasonable balance between speed and compression\n- XPRESS16K: Slower, but stronger\n- LZX: Slowest, but strongest - note it has a higher overhead, so use it on programs/games only if your CPU is reasonably strong or the program/game is older. \n\n \n -----\n ### Like this project?\n Please consider leaving a tip on Ko-Fi :) \n \n <p align=\"center\"><a href='https://ko-fi.com/iridiumio' target='_blank'><img height='42' style='border:0px;height:42px;' src='https://cdn.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi3.png?v=3' border='0' alt='Buy Me a Coffee at ko-fi.com' /></a></p>\n  \n"

First, ensure you have a C compiler and the `cmake` and `luajit` or `lua51-luajit` (for openSUSE) packages installed, as well as `libluajit-5.1-dev` (for Ubuntu/Debian), `luajit-devel` (for Fedora), or `lua51-luajit-devel` (for openSUSE) if your distro has one of these packages.\n2. Create a new folder next to `love-nuklear` called `love-nuklear-build`.\n3. Open a terminal inside `love-nuklear-build`.\n4. Compile the library with\n```sh\n$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../love-nuklear\n$ make\n```\n5. Locate `nuklear.so` in the build folder.\n\n#### Via GNU Guix\n\nL\u00d6VE-Nuklear is also available as a [Guix](http://guix.gnu.org/) package, and can thus be directly downloaded and built via:\n```\n$ guix package --install love-nuklear\n```\n\n### Compiling with CMake and MinGW on Windows\n\n1. Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) and [MinGW](http://mingw.org/) or [MinGW-w64](https://mingw-w64.org/doku.php).\n2. Download the source code for [LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/download.html).\n3. Open a command window inside the LuaJIT folder (the one that contains \"README\").\n4. Compile LuaJIT with\n```sh\n$ mingw32-make\n```\n5. Remember the path to `lua51.dll` inside the LuaJIT `src` folder.\n6. Run the CMake GUI.\n7. Click \"Browse Source\" at the top right, then select the `love-nuklear` folder.\n8. Enter a path for the build folder. It should be separate from the source folder.\n9. Press \"Configure\" at the bottom.\n10. Select \"MinGW Makefiles\" from the generator drop list, then click \"Finish\".\n11. You should receive an error. This is normal.\n12. Open the LUA tree by clicking the triangle on the left.\n13. Replace \"LUA_INCLUDE_DIR-NOTFOUND\" with the path to the LuaJIT `src` folder.\n14. Replace \"LUA_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND\" with the path to `lua51.dll` inside the LuaJIT `src` folder.\n15. Click \"Generate\" at the bottom.\n16. Open a command window inside the build folder.\n17. Compile with\n```sh\n$ mingw32-make\n```\n18. Locate `nuklear.dll` inside the build folder.\n\n### Compiling with CMake and MSVC on Windows\n\n1. Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).\nCommunity or Express edition is sufficient.\n2. Download the source code for [LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/download.html).\n3. Open a Visual Studio Command Prompt (x86 or x64 depending on what architecture you need)\nand set the current directory to the LuaJIT folder (the one that contains \"README\"). Also\nremember this path.\n4. At the VS Command Prompt, set your current directory to `src` then\nexecute `msvcbuild.bat`. This will create lua51.dll, lua51.lib, and luajit.exe\n5. Now open new command prompt window inside the `love-nuklear` folder.\n6. Type `set \"LUA_DIR=<path to directory at step 3>\"`\n7. Then type `cmake -Bbuild -H. -A Win32 -DLUA_INCLUDE_DIR=%LUA_DIR%\\src -DLUA_LIBRARY=%LUA_DIR%\\src\\lua51.lib -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%CD%\\install`.\nIf you previously compile LuaJIT using x64 VS command prompt, replace `Win32` with `x64` at above command.\n8. Then type `cmake --build build --config Release --target install` and you'll found `nuklear.dll` inside \"install\" folder.\n\n## Documentation\n\nA complete description of all functions and style properties, alongside additional examples, is available at the [L\u00d6VE-Nuklear wiki](https://github.com/keharriso/love-nuklear/wiki).\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Kevin Harrison, released under the MIT License (see LICENSE for details).\n"

Nobody, well, almost nobody because it amuses me. That said I understand very well that most players do not want to spend time installing their games, they should not have to do it. The ideal would be to play Linux as a console, we start the game and it plays immediately, no settings or hacks. Lutris allows Linux players to get closer to this goal: once the installation of the scripted game, click on \"Install\" then on \"Play\" and play! No need to have advanced computer skills to make a game work. Former user of PlayOnLinux, I am migrating my list of games to Lutris and I decided to share my scripts with you. It's ridiculous to spend each one of your own time trying to play Linux games when someone has already done so in an automatic way.\n\nWhen I write a script, here are my guidelines:\n\n- minimum interaction with the player, the game installed must be immediately operational without additional settings or hacks.\n- include the latest updates and patches that improve gameplay.\n- multilanguage when possible.\n- maintain the script and improve it if needed.\n- the code must remain simple to understand so that neophytes can reuse it.\n\nYou can here declare a bug or propose a modification for one of my installation scripts.\n\n## FR\nQui veut passer des heures, voir des journ\u00e9es enti\u00e8res \u00e0 installer des vieux jeux DOS/Windows sous Linux avant de pouvoir enfin y jouer? Personne, enfin presque personne puisque moi cela m'amuse. Ceci dit je comprends tr\u00e8s bien que la plupart des joueurs ne souhaitent pas passer du temps \u00e0 installer leurs jeux, ils ne devraient d'ailleurs pas avoir \u00e0 le faire. L'id\u00e9al serait de jouer sous Linux comme sur une console, on lance le jeu et on y joue aussit\u00f4t, pas de r\u00e9glages ni de bidouilles. Lutris permet justement aux joueurs sous Linux de se rapprocher de cet objectif: une fois l'installation du jeu script\u00e9e, cliquez sur \"Install\" puis sur \"Play\" et jouez! Plus besoin d'avoir des connaissances pouss\u00e9es en informatique pour faire fonctionner un jeu. Ancien utilisateur de PlayOnLinux, je suis en train de migrer ma liste de jeux vers Lutris et j'ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de partager mes scripts avec vous. C'est ridicule de passer chacun dans son coin des heures \u00e0 essayer de faire fonctionner ses jeux sous Linux alors qu'une personne l'a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait et de mani\u00e8re automatis\u00e9e.\n\nLorsque j'\u00e9cris un script, voici mes lignes directrices:\n- minimum d'interaction avec le joueur, le jeu install\u00e9 doit \u00eatre de suite op\u00e9rationnel sans r\u00e9glages ni bidouilles suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n- inclures les derni\u00e8res mises \u00e0 jour et des patchs qui am\u00e9liorent la jouabilit\u00e9.\n- multilangage quand c'est possible.\n- maintenir le script et l'am\u00e9liorer si besoin.\n- le code doit rester simple \u00e0 comprendre pour que d'autres n\u00e9ophytes puissent le r\u00e9utiliser.\n\nVous pouvez ici d\u00e9clarer un bug ou proposer une modification pour l'un de mes scripts d'installation.\n\n## Supported Linux distributions (>= GLIBC 2.7)\nall scripts tested and should be compatible on \n\n- Ubuntu 20.04\n- Arch (Manjaro 21, Arcolinux...)\n- OpenSUSE Tumbleweed\n\nand superior version.\n"

Users of the engine should be able to build any kind of game without limitations, in an efficient manner and with an end product that performs optimally when loading and during play.\n\nTo achieve this target the Turbulenz team followed these rules when writing code:\n\n**Modularity**\n\n- Users should be able to pick what they want and replace what they don't.\n- When possible new functionality should be orthogonal to existing one.\n\n**High performance**\n\n- Strict coding standards to keep code efficient.\n- Keep memory allocations to minimum, reuse existing objects or arrays whenever possible, use scratch pads, combine multiple separate objects into a single one.\n- Use most efficient storage for each data, Typed Arrays when possible.\n- Reduce function calls when possible: write functions that handle arrays of objects instead of loops that make a function call per element, games rarely do a single thing to a single object.\n- Be aware of performance differences between browsers.\n- Profile often.\n\n**Asynchronous loading**\n\n- No API should block waiting for a response from the server, avoid polling whenever possible, use callbacks or Promises, to notify of data availability.\n\n**Data driven**\n\n- The target should be to make the game a simple dumb player of data, all functionality defined by simple data files.\n\n**Simple well documented file formats**\n\n- Define simple, easy to create asset formats that can trivially be connected to any tool chain.\n\n**Scalability**\n\n- Design interfaces that can be implemented with different level of detail or quality settings in order to scale from mobile to desktops.\n\n**Power without control is nothing**\n\n- Make sure users can do exactly what they want, with a helper layer put on top if required, document performance implications at every level.\n\n**Fault tolerant**\n\n- The engine should keep going even if any type of asset fails to load. The application is able to provide sensible defaults for all asset types making it easier to stay productive and diagnose issues.\n\n**Fast loading**\n\n- Reduce amount of data to be downloaded, compress data efficiently.\n- Use the browser cache efficiently, use unique file names based on content and tell the browser to cache forever.\n\n**Maintainability**\n\n- Strict coding standards to keep code readable, easy to maintain and debug.\n- Write unit tests, samples and documentation for every new code path.\n\n**Targeted**\n\n- This is a game engine, for games.\n\n\nHistory\n=======\n\nThe Engine was created and is maintained by `Turbulenz Limited <http://biz.turbulenz.com>`__ and was open sourced\nin April 2013.\n\nThe latest release is 1.3.2 which is tagged in the repository or a tarball/zip can be can be downloaded from\n`here <https://github.com/turbulenz/turbulenz_engine/archive/release_1.3.2.tar.gz>`__\n\nA full history of changes can be found in the `Changelog <docs/source/changelog.rst>`__\n\n\nPre-Requisites\n==============\n\nThe pre-requisites for the open source version of the Turbulenz Engine allowing you to use the various\ncommands are\n\n- Python 2.7.x.\n\n  - For Windows we recommend a 32bit install of Python.\n  - If you have multiple Python versions installed e.g. 3.x you may need to run commands with ``python2.7``\n  - On Windows if you didn't add Python to your path in the installer you may need to run ``C:\\Python27\\python.exe``\n  You can check your version with\n  ::\n\n        $ python --version\n        Python 2.7.3\n\n- VirtualEnv - version 1.9.1 or higher recommended\n  You can check your version with\n  ::\n\n        $ virtualenv --version\n        1.9.1\n\n- UglifyJS, turbulenz_build, DefinitelyTyped and NvTriStrip which are included via Git submodules contained\n  within the Turbulenz Engine repository.\n\n- Additional Python packages which will be automatically installed during the initial environment creation\n  using a Python package manager.\n\nPre-requisites for building the tools cgfx2json and NvTriStrip via ``python manage.py tools``\n\n- Compiler Toolchain\n\n  - Windows : Any one of\n\n    - Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 with SP1\n    - Microsoft Visual Studio 2010\n    - Visual C++ 2010 Express\n    - Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 with update 2\n    - Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows Desktop with update 2\n\n  - Mac OSX : Xcode with the command line tools\n\n  - Linux : GCC 4.6.x or higher\n\n- `NVIDIA CgToolkit <https://developer.nvidia.com/cg-toolkit>`__ version 3.1 or higher.

For\n  debian based linux distributions the libgl1-mesa-dev package will provide the required files (e.g. ``sudo\n  apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev``), for other linux distributions find the package supplying GL/gl.h and libGL.so\n\n\nSetup Guide\n===========\n\nThere are two ways to get up and running with the Turbulenz Engine, you can downloaded a packaged fully QA'd\nsnapshot release from the `Turbulenz Hub <https://hub.turbulenz.com>`__. These installers are available for\nWindows, Mac OSX and Linux and will install all the required packages and dependencies to get started,\na full guide can be found at `<http://docs.turbulenz.com/installing.html>`__\n\n*Note: SDK versions prior to 0.26.0 were released under a non open source license.*\n\nIf you want to run with the latest version or would like to contribute to the open source project the steps for\ngetting setup are included below. Use of the open source repository is tested against Windows, Mac OSX and Linux\nbut may also work on other unix-like operating systems.\n\nSetup\n-----\n\n1. Clone the repository `<http://github.com/turbulenz/turbulenz_engine>`__ (or if you wish you can fork the repository\n   on GitHub and clone that). To clone the repository maintained by Turbulenz use\n   ::\n\n        $ git clone git://github.com/turbulenz/turbulenz_engine.git\n\n2. The Turbulenz Engine submodules the following technology in the external folder\n\n   + tzbuild: https://github.com/turbulenz/turbulenz_build\n   + DefinitelyTyped: https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped\n   + UglifyJS: https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS.git\n\n   Initialize the Git submodules with\n   ::\n\n        $ git submodule update --init\n\n3. Check you have the `pre-requisites`_ installed\n\n4. From the cloned repository create a VirtualEnv environment to install the required Python packages and NodeJS,\n   allowing you to use all the features of the Turbulenz Engine. Note if Python is not on your shell's path you\n   will need to specify the full path for this first command.\n   ::\n\n        $ python manage.py env\n\n5. Activate the environment in your shell.\n   ::\n\n        $ source env/bin/activate - for bash and similar shells\n        > env\\scripts\\activate.bat - for Windows\n\n6. If you want to move onto the API tutorial section next then your final command is to build the JavaScript sources\n   from the TypeScript sources. The next section will detail some of the additional actions you can perform or you\n   can move onto `Getting Started With The API`_\n   ::\n\n        $ python manage.py jslib\n\nWorking With The Open Source Project\n------------------------------------\n\nThe manage.py script at the top level of the repository provides a set of commands for managing the Engine, the\nscript should be run as ``python manage.py command`` on Windows but can usually be shortcut to ``./manage.py command``\non unix shells. Running the script with ``--help`` will give a list of commands available, most of these are\ndescribed below. All the commands other than the env command expect to have the VirtualEnv environment activated\nas described in the setup section.\n\n- **JavaScript Sources** - The Turbulenz Engine source is written in TypeScript. To generate the JavaScript version\n  of the engine source run the command\n  ::\n\n    $ python manage.py jslib\n\n- **Tools** - The Turbulenz Engine includes a number of Python tools which are installed during the env command.\n  In addition the Engine includes a CGFX shader conversion tool which can be built with the following command.\n  See the `pre-requisites`_ section for details of required compiler toolchains.\n  ::\n\n    $ python manage.py tools\n\n- **Documentation** - The Turbulenz Engine documentation is based on restructured text sources. To build the html\n  documentation run the command\n  ::\n\n    $ python manage.py docs\n\n- **Samples** - Various samples are included with the Turbulenz Engine. These can be built from their TypeScript\n  sources with the command below. This generates a set of html files, JavaScript and asset JSON files which can\n  be served with a web server such as the Turbulenz Local Development Server.\n  ::\n\n    $ python manage.py samples\n\n- **Applications** - The Turbulenz Engine project includes a few larger applications and some templates for building\n  your own application. These can be found in the apps folder, and can be built with the command\n  ::\n\n    $ python manage.py apps\n\n  You can also build individual apps by specifying their name e.g.\n  ::\n\n    $ python manage.py apps multiworm\n\n- **Command Line Tools** - Various command line tools for processing code and assets are installed as part of the\n  virtual environment. These are available at the command line e.g. running ``dae2json`` will execute the dae2json\n  tool used to convert Collada assets to a Turbulenz Engine JSON asset format. See the\n  `tools <http://docs.turbulenz.com/tools/index.html>`__ section in the documentation for more details on the tools.\n\n- **Local Development Server** - Setting up the environment also includes a locally hosted web server which can be\n  used for development of HTML5 games and applications. See the\n  `Local Server <https://github.com/turbulenz/turbulenz_local>`__ repository for more details.\n\n\nGetting Started With The API\n============================\n\nTo try the Turbulenz APIs requires only a text editor and a browser such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.\nCreate an HTML file with the following content and place it in the root of the Turbulenz directory::\n\n    <html>\n    <head>\n        <title>Turbulenz - API - Clear Screen Example</title>\n        <script src=\"jslib/debug.js\"></script>\n        <script src=\"jslib/webgl/turbulenzengine.js\"></script>\n        <script src=\"jslib/webgl/graphicsdevice.js\"></script>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <canvas id=\"canvas\" width=\"640px\" height=\"480px\"/>\n        <script>\n            TurbulenzEngine = WebGLTurbulenzEngine.create({\n                canvas: document.getElementById(\"canvas\")\n            });\n            var graphicsDevice = TurbulenzEngine.createGraphicsDevice({});\n\n            var bgColor = [1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0];\n\n            function update() {\n                if (graphicsDevice.beginFrame()) {\n                    graphicsDevice.clear(bgColor, 1.0);\n                    graphicsDevice.endFrame();\n                }\n            }\n\n            TurbulenzEngine.setInterval(update, 1000 / 60);\n        </script>\n    </body>\n    </html>\n\nAfter defining a <canvas> element of 640x480 pixels, this code will create the TurbulenzEngine and request the GraphicDevice module.\nUsing an update function called at a frequency of 60fps, the GraphicsDevice will clear the screen yellow.\nTo run the example, open the HTML file in your browser.\nYou should see a yellow rectangle.\n\nTo use assets such as images you will need to host a HTML file and assets on a webserver.\nAny webserver will work, a quick way to try is to activate the Turbulenz environment in the root of the Turbulenz directory and run::\n\n    python -m SimpleHTTPServer\n\nThis command will host the contents of the Turbulenz directory on your machine as a webserver.\n\nTo demonstrate loading an asset you can try loading an image file and drawing it as a textured sprite using the Draw2D API.\nCreate another HTML file with the following content and also place it in the root of the Turbulenz directory::\n\n    <html>\n    <head>\n        <title>Turbulenz - API - Textured Sprite Example</title>\n        <script src=\"jslib/debug.js\"></script>\n        <script src=\"jslib/webgl/turbulenzengine.js\"></script>\n        <script src=\"jslib/webgl/graphicsdevice.js\"></script>\n        <script src=\"jslib/draw2d.js\"></script>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <canvas id=\"canvas\" width=\"640px\" height=\"480px\"/>\n        <script>\n            TurbulenzEngine = WebGLTurbulenzEngine.create({\n                canvas: document.getElementById(\"canvas\")\n            });\n            var graphicsDevice = TurbulenzEngine.createGraphicsDevice({});\n            var draw2D = Draw2D.create({\n                graphicsDevice: graphicsDevice\n            });\n\n            var bgColor = [1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0];\n\n            var sprite = Draw2DSprite.create({\n                width: 100,\n                height: 100,\n                x: graphicsDevice.width / 2,\n                y: graphicsDevice.height / 2,\n                color: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0],\n                rotation: Math.PI / 4\n            });\n\n            var texture = graphicsDevice.createTexture({\n                src: \"assets/textures/crate.jpg\",\n                mipmaps: true,\n                onload: function (texture)\n                {\n                    if (texture)\n                    {\n                        sprite.setTexture(texture);\n                        sprite.setTextureRectangle([0, 0, texture.width, texture.height]);\n                    }\n                }\n            });\n\n            var PI2 = Math.PI * 2;\n            var rotateAngle = PI2 / 360; // 1 deg per frame\n\n            function update() {\n\n                sprite.rotation += rotateAngle;\n                sprite.rotation %= PI2; // Wrap rotation at PI * 2\n\n                if (graphicsDevice.beginFrame()) {\n                    graphicsDevice.clear(bgColor, 1.0);\n\n                    draw2D.begin();\n                    draw2D.drawSprite(sprite);\n                    draw2D.end();\n\n                    graphicsDevice.endFrame();\n                }\n            }\n\n            TurbulenzEngine.setInterval(update, 1000 / 60);\n        </script>\n    </body>\n    </html>\n\nThis time, instead of opening the file in the browser, navigate your browser to *http://127.0.0.1:8000* or *http://localhost:8000* and select the HTML file you created.\nYou should see a spinning textured box in the middle of a yellow rectangle.\n\nThe next step is render a simple textured mesh in 3D.\nTo do this you will need to build some assets from their source files.\nMake sure you have run the *tools* command to build the tools for your platform::\n\n    $ python manage.py tools\n\n*Note: The requirements for building the tools is different per platform. See the* `Pre-Requisites`_ *section.*\n\nFor this example you should use the `Protolib <http://docs.turbulenz.com/protolib/protolib_api.html>`__ library, which is ideal for prototyping games using Turbulenz.\nYou will need these assets::\n\n    - models/duck.dae\n    - textures/duck.png\n    - textures/default_light.png\n    - shaders/shadowmapping.cgfx\n    - shaders/zonly.cgfx\n    - shaders/forwardrendering.cgfx\n    - shaders/forwardrenderingshadows.cgfx\n    - shaders/debug.cgfx\n    - shaders/font.cgfx\n    - shaders/simplesprite.cgfx\n    - fonts/opensans-8.fnt\n    - fonts/opensans-16.fnt\n    - fonts/opensans-32.fnt\n    - fonts/opensans-64.fnt\n    - fonts/opensans-128.fnt\n    - textures/opensans-8_0.png\n    - textures/opensans-16_0.png\n    - textures/opensans-32_0.png\n    - textures/opensans-64_0.png\n    - textures/opensans-128_0.png\n\nCopy this text into a file called \"deps.yaml\" and place it in the root of the Turbulenz directory.\nHaving built the tools you can now run this command with the Turbulenz environment activated::\n\n    $ python scripts/buildassets.py --root . --assets-path assets\n\nThis will build the assets listed in the deps.yaml and output a \"staticmax\" directory and \"mapping_table.json\" file containing the processed assets and a mapping to them for the webserver.\nWhen a library tries to request one of these files, it will be able to find it in the staticmax directory.\nNow you can create the mesh example HTML file and place it at the root of the Turbulenz directory::\n\n    <html>\n

duck with a yellow texture on a white background and lit by a static point light.\n\nFor more information on how to build your own assets see the `assets section

Introduction](#1-introduction)\n- [2. Building](#2-building)\n- [3. Run](#3-run)\n- [4. Docker](#4-run-in-docker)\n\n<!-- /TOC -->\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nWeb3Games is a new generation gaming ecosystem built on Substrate.\n\n## 2. Building\n\nInstall Rust:\n\n```bash\ncurl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh\n```\n\nInitialize your Wasm Build environment:\n\n```bash\n./scripts/init.sh\n```\n\nBuild Wasm and native code:\n\n```bash\ncargo build --release\n```\n\n## 3. Run\n\n### Single Node Development Chain\n\nPurge any existing developer chain state:\n\n```bash\n./target/release/web3games-node purge-chain --dev\n```\n\nStart a development chain with:\n\n```bash\n./target/release/web3games-node --dev\n```\n\nDetailed logs may be shown by running the node with the following environment variables set: `RUST_LOG=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run -- --dev`.\n\n### Multi-Node Local Testnet\n\nIf you want to see the multi-node consensus algorithm in action locally, then you can create a local testnet with two validator nodes for Alice and Bob, who are the initial authorities of the genesis chain that have been endowed with testnet units.\n\nOptionally, give each node a name and expose them so they are listed on the Polkadot [telemetry site](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#/Local%20Testnet).\n\nYou'll need two terminal windows open.\n\nWe'll start Alice's substrate node first on default TCP port 30333 with her chain database stored locally at `/tmp/alice`. The bootnode ID of her node is `QmRpheLN4JWdAnY7HGJfWFNbfkQCb6tFf4vvA6hgjMZKrR`, which is generated from the `--node-key` value that we specify below:\n\n```bash\ncargo run -- \\\n  --base-path /tmp/alice \\\n  --chain=local \\\n  --alice \\\n  --node-key 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 \\\n  --telemetry-url 'wss://telemetry.polkadot.io/submit/ 0' \\\n  --validator\n```\n\nIn the second terminal, we'll start Bob's substrate node on a different TCP port of 30334, and with his chain database stored locally at `/tmp/bob`. We'll specify a value for the `--bootnodes` option that will connect his node to Alice's bootnode ID on TCP port 30333:\n\n```bash\ncargo run -- \\\n  --base-path /tmp/bob \\\n  --bootnodes /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/30333/p2p/QmRpheLN4JWdAnY7HGJfWFNbfkQCb6tFf4vvA6hgjMZKrR \\\n  --chain=local \\\n  --bob \\\n  --port 30334 \\\n  --telemetry-url 'wss://telemetry.polkadot.io/submit/ 0' \\\n  --validator\n```\n\n## 4. Run in Docker\n\nFirst, install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and\n[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).\n\nThen run the following command to start a single node development chain.\n\n```bash\n./scripts/docker_run.sh\n```\n\nThis command will firstly compile your code, and then start a local development network. You can\nalso replace the default command\n(`cargo build --release && ./target/release/web3games-node --dev --ws-external`)\nby appending your own. A few useful ones are as follow.\n\n```bash\n# Run Substrate node without re-compiling\n./scripts/docker_run.sh ./target/release/web3games-node --dev --ws-external\n\n# Purge the local dev chain\n./scripts/docker_run.sh ./target/release/web3games-node purge-chain --dev\n\n# Check whether the code is compilable\n./scripts/docker_run.sh cargo check\n```\n\n## License\n\nWeb3Games is released under the [GPL v3.0 License](LICENSE).\n"

in other words, even if written in C++, Trees are _not_ hard-coded.\n\n- You can statically link your custom TreeNodes or convert them into __plugins__\nwhich can be loaded at run-time.\n\n- It provides a type-safe and flexible mechanism to do __Dataflow__ between\n  Nodes of the Tree.\n\n- It includes a __logging/profiling__ infrastructure that allows the user \nto visualize, record, replay and analyze state transitions.\n\n- Last but not least: it is well [documented](https://www.behaviortree.dev/)!\n\n## Documentation\n\nYou can learn about the main concepts, the API and the tutorials here: https://www.behaviortree.dev/\n\nTo find more details about the conceptual ideas that make this implementation different from others,\nyou can read the [final deliverable of the project MOOD2Be](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/blob/master/MOOD2Be_final_report.pdf).\n\n## Forum and Community\n\nIf the documentation doesn't answer your questions and/or you want to\nconnect with the other **BT.CPP** users, visit https://discourse.behaviortree.dev/\n\n## Commercial support\n\nAre you using BT.CPP in your commercial product and you need technical support / consulting?\nYou can get in touch at dfaconti@aurynrobotics.com and we will happy to discuss your use case and needs.\n\n# Design principles\n\nThe main goal of this project is to create a Behavior Tree implementation\nthat uses the principles of Model Driven Development to separate the role \nof the __Component Developer__ from the __Behavior Designer__.\n\nIn practice, this means that:\n\n- Custom TreeNodes must be reusable building blocks. \n You should be able to implement them once and reuse them to build many behaviors.\n\n- To build a Behavior Tree out of TreeNodes, the Behavior Designer must \nnot need to read nor modify the C++ source code of a given TreeNode.\n\n- Complex Behaviours must be composable using Subtrees\n\nMany of the features and, sometimes, the apparent limitations of this library, might be a consequence \nof this design principle. \n\nFor instance, having a scoped BlackBoard, visible only in a portion of the tree, is particularly important \nto avoid \"name pollution\" and allow the creation of large scale trees.\n\n# GUI Editor\n\nEditing a BehaviorTree is as simple as editing a XML file in your favourite text editor.\n\nIf you are looking for a more fancy graphical user interface (and I know you do) check \n[Groot](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/Groot) out.\n\n![Groot screenshot](docs/groot-screenshot.png)\n\n## Watch Groot and BehaviorTree.CPP in action\n\nClick on the following image to see a short video of how the C++ library and\nthe graphic user interface are used to design and monitor a Behavior Tree.\n\n[![MOOD2Be](docs/video_MOOD2Be.png)](https://vimeo.com/304651183)\n\n# How to compile (plain old cmake)\n\nOn Ubuntu, you are encourage to install the following dependencies:\n\n     sudo apt-get install libzmq3-dev libboost-dev\n     \nOther dependencies are already included in the __3rdparty__ folder.\n\nTo compile and install the library, from the BehaviorTree.CPP folder, execute:\n\n     mkdir build; cd build\n     cmake ..\n     make\n     sudo make install\n\nIf you want to use BT.CPp in your application a typical **CMakeLists.txt** file \nwill look like this:\n\n```cmake\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)\n\nproject(hello_BT)\n\nset(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)\nset(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)\nfind_package(BehaviorTreeV3)\n\nadd_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} \"hello_BT.cpp\")\ntarget_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} BT::behaviortree_cpp_v3)\n```\n\n## ROS1 or ROS2 users (Catkin/Ament)\n\nYou can easily install the package with the command\n\n      sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-behaviortree-cpp-v3\n      \nIf you want to compile it with catkin, you __must__ include this package \nto your catkin workspace.\n\n# Acknowledgement\n\nThis library was initially developed at  **Eurecat - https://eurecat.org/en/** (main author, Davide Faconti) in a joint effort\nwith the **Italian Institute of Technology** (Michele Colledanchise).\n\nThis software is one of the main components of [MOOD2Be](https://eurecat.org/en/portfolio-items/mood2be/),\nwhich is one of the six **Integrated Technical Projects (ITPs)** selected from the\n[RobMoSys first open call](https://robmosys.eu/itp/).

  "readme_contents": "# PixelCamera2D\nA Pixel Perfect Camera for 2D Games in Unity.\n\n##### This is an early work in progress. Please report any issues you find. Also, feel free to contribute fixes or additions.\n\n## Why Should I Use PixelCamera2D?\n\nUnity is a great engine, but it isn't perfect for 2D games that use pixel art. This can become evident when you try to rotate sprites or move sprites. Rotating sprites often results in perfectly diagonal edges that leave the pixel grid. Moving sprites can have a similar problem where pixels don't line up as expected. Check out the [GIFs](#demo) below in the [Demo](#demo) section to see examples with and without PixelCamera2D.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe setup used in `PixelCamera2D` uses two camera's, a quad, and a render texture to display your game. The first camera renders an image to a render texture which is sized according to the `Base Width` and `Base Height` values. The second camera renders its child quad whose texture is the render texture mentioned above. This child quad is resized and scaled account to the screen width and height. \n\nThis method makes pixel art games more consistant by removing perfectly straight diagonal lines and providing better scaling and letterboxing options.\n\n## Installation\n\nCopy the `PixelCamera2D` folder into your `Assets` folder.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Drag the `PixelCamera2D` prefab from the `PixelCamera2D/Prefabs` folder into your scene. This prefab contains the pixel camera, render camera, and rendered quad.\n2. Set the Camera component's `Size` value if necessary.\n3. Set the `Base Width` and `Base Height` to a value that your pixel art was designed for. This is used to determine how many pixels wide and high your game should be. This is used when determining best fit and scaling sizes.\n4. Click the `Create RenderTexture Asset` button and choose a location to save the new render texture. This is created using the given `Base Width` and `Base Height`, so anytime those change you should use this button. If you have an existing render texture that is the correct size from another scene, you can simply drop that into the camera's `Base Texture` value in the inspector.\n\n## Inspector Options\n\n- Base Height: The height of your game view.\n- Base Width: The width of your game view.\n- Behaviour: The type of view scaling behaviour to use. There are two options currently.\n  - Best Pixel Perfect Fit: Scales your view by pixel perfect increments like 1x, 2x, 3x, etc. This ensures equal pixel sizes. For example for a base size of 200x200, view size will be fixed to sizes like 200x200, 400x400, etc depending on screen size.\n  - Scale To Fit: Scales the view to fill the screen as much as possible while maintaining aspect ratio. This fills most of the screen, but may results in some rendering artifacts because of uneven pixel sizes.\n- Quad: The quad the camera will render to. This shouldn't have to be changed.\n\n## Notes\n\n- To change your letterbox color just change the background color on the `PixelCamera2DRenderer` object.\n\n## Demo\n\nThis project contains a demo in the `PixelCamera2DDemo` folder. This includes an example of static sprites, moving sprites, and a line renderer to show how each behaves. It also includes a button in play mode to enable and disable `PixelCamera2D` so that you can compare what your game would like with or without it.\n\n<a name=\"gifs\"></a>\n\n#### Without PixelCamera2D\n\n![Without PixelCamera2D](http://i.imgur.com/I6kZml0.gif)\n\nNotice the differently sized pixels and smooth diagonal edges on the sprites and line.\n\n#### With PixelCamera2D\n\n![With PixelCamera2D](http://i.imgur.com/aTETXV0.gif)\n\nThe pixels are now of equal size and the diagonal lines have been pixelated.\n\n\n"

**Internal**: Usually used when your target is inject dll into game process.\n    - It's generate functions and funtction params. without `ReadAsMe`/`WriteAsMe` function.\n    - You can directly cast/write block of memory as your class/struct.\n  - **External**: Usually used when your target is write or read game process memory from your process.\n    - Support read as object (class/struct) with `ReadAsMe` function in **every** class/struct.\n    - Support write as object (class/struct) with `WriteAsMe` function in **every** class/struct.\n    - It's useful to read/write block of memory as class/struct.\n    - No functions generaterd for external for now. maybe later i will support call function from external.\n    - To support `ReadAsMe`/`WriteAsMe` in your project, you need to edit **settings** file.\n    - Good example for `read` function [here](https://github.com/CorrM/Unreal-Finder-Tool/blob/ebc7abfd28b2a5a3df19baffc485770f982d102d/UnrealFinderTool/Memory.h#L24), for write function same as `read` but `WriteProcessMemory`.\n- Some Optimization.\n\n##### 28-05-2019\n- Add UI.\n- Some changes to `SDK Generator` and `Instance Logger`.\n- Let GObject address getted form `GObject Finder` be valid to use directly.\n  -

  "readme_contents": "[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)\n\nAfter working on a [Perlin-noise-based map\ngenerator](http://simblob.blogspot.com/2010/01/simple-map-generation.html)\nI had wanted something with islands and rivers and volcanoes and\nlava. However, I had a lot of trouble getting that map generator to\ngenerate any more than what it did at first. This project was my\nexploration of several different techniques for map generation.\n\nThe goal is to make continent/island style maps (surrounded by water)\nthat can be used by a variety of games. I had originally intended to\nwrite a reusable C++ library but ended up writing the code in\nActionscript.\n\nThe most important features I want are nice island/continent\ncoastlines, mountains, and rivers. Non goals include impassable areas\n(except for the ocean), maze-like structures, or realistic height\nmaps. The high level approach is to\n\n  1. Make a coastline.\n  2. Set elevation to distance from coastline. Mountains are farthest from the coast.\n  3. Create rivers in valleys, flowing down to the coast.\n\nThe implementation generates a vector map with roughly 1,000 polygons,\ninstead of a tile/grid map with roughly 1,000,000 tiles.  In games the\npolygons can be used for distinct areas with their own story and\npersonality, places for towns and resources, quest locations,\nconquerable territory, etc.  Polygon boundaries are used for\nrivers. Polygon-to-polygon routes are used for roads. Forests, oceans,\nrivers, swamps, etc. can be named. Polygons are rendered into a bitmap\nto produce the tile map, but the underlying polygon structure is still\navailable.\n\nThe [full process is described here](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/).\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n*   I started out with C++ code that used mountains, soil erosion, water flow, water erosion, water evaporation, volanoes, lava flow, and other physical processes to sculpt terrain expressed in a 2d array of tiles. However as described [in this blog post](http://simblob.blogspot.com/2010/06/teleological-vs-ontogenetic-map.html) I decided to abandon this approach.\n\n*   Since my initial approach failed, I wrote several small prototypes to figure out how to make rivers, coastlines, and mountains. These are the key features I want to support. I will then figure out how to combine them into a map.\n\n*   The voronoi_set.as prototype worked well and I continued adding to it (instead of converting to C++). It supports terrain types: ocean, land, beach, lake, forest, swamp, desert, ice, rocky, grassland, savannah. It has rivers and roads. I decided not to convert it to C++ for now. Instead, I've refactored it into the core map generation (Map.as), display and GUI (mapgen2.as), graph representation (graph/*.as), decorative elements (Roads.as, Lava.as), and noisy edge generation (NoisyEdges.as).\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nThese third-party requirements have been added to the ``third-party`` directory:\n\n* [as3delaunay](https://github.com/nodename/as3delaunay) for the Voronoi algorithm\n* [as3corelib](https://github.com/mikechambers/as3corelib) for PNG export\n* The AS3 version of [de.polygonal.math.PM_PRNG.as](http://lab.polygonal.de/2007/04/21/a-good-pseudo-random-number-generator-prng/) for consistent random numbers\n\nMake sure you run ``git submodule update --init`` to check out the third-party libraries.\n\nCompiling\n---------\n\nTo compile ``mapgen2.as`` to ``mapgen2.swf``, use the following command:\n\n    mxmlc -source-path+=third-party/PM_PRNG -source-path+=third-party/as3delaunay/src -source-path+=third-party/as3corelib/src mapgen2.as\n\n"

You can specify a different folder name like this:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/ourcade/phaser3-parcel-template.git my-folder-name\n```\n\nGo into your new project folder and install dependencies:\n\n```bash\ncd phaser3-parcel-template # or 'my-folder-name'\nnpm install\n```\n\nStart development server:\n\n```\nnpm run start\n```\n\nTo create a production build:\n\n```\nnpm run build\n```\n\nProduction files will be placed in the `dist` folder. Then upload those files to a web server. \ud83c\udf89\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\n    .\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 dist\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 node_modules\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 public\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 src\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 scenes\n    \u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 HelloWorldScene.js\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.html\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.js\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 package.json\n```\n\nThe contents of this template is the basic [Phaser3 getting started example](http://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3/part5).\n\nThis template assumes you will want to organize your code into multiple files and use modern JavaScript (or TypeScript).\n\nJavaScript files are intended for the `src` folder. `main.js` is the entry point referenced by `index.html`.\n\nOther than that there is no opinion on how you should structure your project. There is a `scenes` folder in `src` where the `HelloWorldScene.js` lives but you can do whatever you want.\n\n## Static Assets\n\nAny static assets like images or audio files should be placed in the `public` folder. It'll then be served at http://localhost:8000/images/my-image.png\n\nExample `public` structure:\n\n```\n    public\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 images\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 my-image.png\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 music\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 ...\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 sfx\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 ...\n```\n\nThey can then be loaded by Phaser with `this.image.load('my-image', 'images/my-image.png')`.\n\n## Class Properties Support\n\nThis template includes class property support out of the box using `@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties`.\n\nA `.babelrc` is included as well as the use of `babel-eslint` as the parser for ESLint.\n\n# ESLint\n\nThis template uses a basic `eslint` set up for code linting to help you find and fix common problems in your JavaScript code.\n\nIt does not aim to be opinionated.\n\n[See here for rules to turn on or off](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/).\n\n## TypeScript\n\nCheck out the [phaser3-typescript-parcel-template](https://github.com/ourcade/phaser3-typescript-parcel-template) for a ready-to-use version of this template in TypeScript!\n\n## Dev Server Port\n\nYou can change the dev server's port number by modifying the `start` script in `package.json`. We use Parcel's `-p` option to specify the port number.\n\nThe script looks like this:\n\n```\nparcel src/index.html -p 8000\n```\n\nChange 8000 to whatever you want.\n\n## Other Notes\n\n[parcel-plugin-clean-easy](https://github.com/lifuzhao100/parcel-plugin-clean-easy) is used to ensure only the latest files are in the `dist` folder. You can modify this behavior by changing `parcelCleanPaths` in `package.json`.\n\n[parcel-plugin-static-files](https://github.com/elwin013/parcel-plugin-static-files-copy#readme) is used to copy static files from `public` into the output directory and serve it. You can add additional paths by modifying `staticFiles` in `package.json`.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT License](https://github.com/ourcade/phaser3-parcel-template/blob/master/LICENSE)\n"

  "readme_contents": "# \u03bcniverse [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/unixpickle/muniverse?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/unixpickle/muniverse)\n\n\u03bcniverse is my attempt to wrap a bunch of HTML5 games in a single API. This is similar to [openai/universe](https://github.com/openai/universe), except that it avoids Flash and VNC. For more on this, see [Advantages over Universe](#advantages-over-universe)\n\nThis is a work in progress. See [Roadmap](#roadmap) for more details.\n\n# Getting Started\n\n\u00b5niverse depends on a few software projects. It requires fairly new versions, so package managers like `apt-get` may not be suitable. Here are the packages and links to downloads:\n\n * [Docker >= 17.03](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#time-based-release-schedule)\n * [Go >= 1.8](https://golang.org/dl/)\n\nInstalling Go is particularly involved, as you will want to create a `GOPATH`. See [here](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) for details on that.\n\nOnce you have Go and Docker, you can download \u00b5niverse in one easy step:\n\n```\ngo get github.com/unixpickle/muniverse\n```\n\nThe first time you use \u00b5niverse, it will pull a somewhat large Docker container. I recommend you do this manually before you use \u00b5niverse:\n\n```\ndocker pull unixpickle/muniverse:0.115.0\n```\n\nOnce you have \u00b5niverse installed, you may want to install [bindings](bindings) for other languages such as Python. If you want to use \u00b5niverse from Go, [muniverse-agent](https://github.com/unixpickle/muniverse-agent) might serve as a good starting point. You may also want to checkout the [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/unixpickle/muniverse) for API details.\n\n# Advantages over Universe\n\nCompared to OpenAI Universe, \u03bcniverse will give the following advantages:\n\n * No need to play games in real-time.\n   * No \"falling behind\" on slower computers\n   * Play games faster than real-time on fast machines.\n * No need for a neural network to read scores from screenshots.\n * Fewer [glitches](https://github.com/openai/universe/issues/187) due to menu automation.\n * No unsafe actions (e.g. pressing the Main Menu button).\n * No Docker containers without accompanying source code\n   * All code to generate containers is included\n   * Open source scripts to download & package games\n\nMost of the above advantages come from focusing on HTML5 games rather than Flash games.\n\n# Contents\n\n * **this directory** - high-level Go API for controlling environments\n * [chrome/](chrome) - Go API for controlling a headless Chrome instance\n * [games/](games) - scripts for downloading & packaging games\n * [container/](container) - build files for the Docker container\n * [codegen/](codegen) - small program to auto-generate Go games registry\n * [util/](util) - small tools which come in handy while using \u00b5niverse.\n * [bindings/](bindings) - bindings for other programming languages.\n\n# Roadmap\n\nHere's what is done so far:\n\n * Go API for interfacing with headless Chrome.\n * Mechanism for downloading & packaging games.\n * JavaScript interface for controlling time (timers, Date, etc.)\n * Docker container for running headless Chrome.\n * Go API for controlling Docker containers.\n * Simple interface for gym-like environment control.\n * Python bindings\n\nHere's a (non-exhaustive) to-do list:\n\n * Get more games.\n * Gym integration.\n * Get WebGL to work without occasional failures.\n * Better way to verify connection to keep-alive socket.\n * Rewrite download script in Go:\n   * Faster (jq is slow)\n   * Support absolute paths? (how to specify destination...)\n * Cleaner Windows IP address lookups\n\n# License\n\nThis is under a BSD 2-clause license. See [LICENSE](LICENSE).\n"

  "language": "C#",
  "readme_contents": "**No longer maintained.** You can find an active fork at [Depressurizer/Depressurizer](https://github.com/Depressurizer/Depressurizer).\n\n----\n\n**This is a continuation of [rallion](https://github.com/rallion)'s [Depressurizer](https://github.com/rallion/depressurizer)**.\n\n----\n\n### Depressurizer\nfor v0.7.4.2\n\n----\n\n![Main Window](http://i.imgur.com/2K70Jog.jpg)\n\n\n### Summary\n\nDepressurizer is a program aimed at making it a bit easier to manage large Steam game libraries. It can auto-categorize your games for you. Currently, it does so based on data from that games' Steam store pages. It can use genres, Steam flags (like \"Single-Player\" and \"Steam Cloud\"), Steam tags, Developer & Publisher info, How Long to Beat times, year, and/or Steam review user scores.  Auto-categorizing can be done manually or automatically via shortcut.\n\nIn addition to providing a way to quickly and easily modify games' assigned categories, it also lets you mark them as Favorites or as Hidden.\n\nIt also saves your configuration information independently of Steam, providing an automatic backup in the event that Steam loses your configuration.\n\n----\n\n### Requirements\n\n - Depressurizer requires the .NET Framework 4.7.\n\n - It must be run on the same computer on which you use Steam, or one one of the computers on which you use Steam.\n\n----\n\n### Usage guide\n\n#### Getting started\n\nDownload the latest version of Depressurizer from the project's [release page](../../releases) .\n\nThe first time you run Depressurizer, it will ask you for your Steam directory. If it is not automatically and correctly detected, fill this in.\n\nNext, it will ask you to set up a profile. The easiest thing to do here is to simply select your profile from the \"Select User\" list and click OK.\n\nAfter a moment, you should see the game list fill up with all your games. You can now categorize them as you wish.\n\nWhen you are ready to save your changes, **you must first completely close Steam**. You can this by clicking on Steam > Exit in the client, or by right clicking the Steam icon in your system tray and clicking Exit.\n\nOnce Steam is closed, all you need to do is click on File > Save in Depressurizer. This will save your profile and, if you haven't changed any settings, will also automatically update your Steam config files with your changes. When you re-open Steam, your games should be organized.\n\nBy default, Depressurizer will automatically load and update your profile the next time you launch the program.\n\n#### Manual categorization\n\nThere are several ways to manually modify your games within Depressurizer.\n\n- **The Game Panel**\n\n  Changes made to the checkboxes at the bottom of the screen will automatically apply to ALL selected games. The checkboxes will update to reflect the current categories of the selected games.\n\n- **Drag and Drop**\n\n  If you select games in the list, and drag them to a category in the list on the left, you can add them to the selected category. You can drag them to \"favorites\" to set them as favorites, or to Uncategorized to clear their categories.\n \n  If you hold `Ctrl` when you drag items, you can remove them from the selected category instead of adding them.\n\n- **Context menu**\n\n  If you right click on the game list, there are options to add categories, remove categories, or alter the Favorite setting for the selected games.\n\n#### Game Filtering\n\nThere are a few ways to filter your game list.\n\n- **Simple Filter**\n\n  You can use simple category filter, which lets you select a category and view all games in that category. You can also view all games, all \"favorite\" games, or all games not assigned to any category.\n\n- **Column-based Filter**\n\n  You can right click on any of the columns titles on the game list to filter games based on the data displayed on the selected column.\n\n- **Advanced Filter**\n\n  You can also use advanced filter, which lets you view games based on combinations of categories. In order for a game to be displayed, it must match the criteria that you specify.\n\n  - **Allowed** is indicated by a green check-mark (\u2713). If any categories are Allowed, then only games that are in *at least one* of these categories will be displayed. It's not necessary to allow categories all the time: if no categories are set to allowed, then the filtering ignores this criteria.\n  - **Required** is indicated by a blue circle (\u25cb). Only games that are in *all* Required categories are displayed.\n  - **Excluded** is indicated by a red cross (\u2573). Only games that are in *no* Excluded categories are displayed.\n \n  This advanced filter can be useful to find games that are not categorized the way that you want. You can use it to find games that are in two categories that should be mutually exclusive by setting them both to Required. If you have a set of categories where all your games should be in at least one, you can set all of them to Excluded to find games that are in none of them.\n\n  *New with v.0.7.0*: you can now save Advanced Filters and apply them as needed. Advanced Filters can now also be applied to AutoCats to greater control the auto-categorization process.\n\n- **Search Filter**\n\n  Finally, you can always type into the Search box to find games with particular names. It will filter your current view to only games which have names that contain your search term.\n\n#### Auto-categorization\n\nAuto-categorization in Depressurizer is based around different schemes that determine what categories to add to (or remove from) each game. These schemes are configurable, and are referred to as \"AutoCats\".\n\nYou can auto-categorize your games by clicking the Auto-categorize button below the game list. This will apply any AutoCats selected in the list above the button, to the displayed list of games.  AutoCats are applied in the order listed.\n\nYou can auto-categorize all games by using the \"AutoCat All\" item in the Tools menu.\n\nTo modify, delete or create new AutoCats, click the \"Edit AutoCats...\" item in the Profile menu.  You can also double-click on any AutoCat, or use the context menu.\n\nThere are currently nine types of AutoCat:\n\n - **Genre:** This type autocategorizes games based on the genres it is assigned in the Steam store. It has several configuration options.\n\n   - *Prefix (optional):* This is just a text prefix added to the beginning of all category names assigned by this scheme.\n\n   - *Max Categories:* This is the maximum number of categories that will be assigned to each game. If a particular game has more categories, they will be ignored. 0 indicates no maximum.\n\n   - *Remove Existing Genre Categories:* This will remove other categories ONLY if they could potentially be added by this scheme. If a game already belongs to a category that has the name of a genre, with the Prefix, it will be removed before new categories are added to it.\n\n   - *Use Tags if no genres are set:* Some games in the Steam store do not have any actual genres set, but they do generally still have tags. This will use those tags if no genres exist. It will only assign categories that match the names of Steam store genres.\n  \n   - *Ignored Genres:* If you don't want a particular genre to be added as a category, select it here.\n\n - **Flags:** This refers to the items on the right-hand side of the Steam Store pages that indicate certain features. For example, all games with the \"Local Co-op\" feature listed will be placed into a \"Local Co-op\" category.\n\n   - *Prefix (optional):* This is just a text prefix added to the beginning of all genre names assigned by this scheme.\n\n   - *Included Flags:* Only the items selected in this list will be used.\n\n - **Tags:** This refers to the user-created tags. There are many more tags than there are genres or flags, so there are some options here to limit the ones you have to deal with.\n\n   - *Prefix (optional):* This is just a text prefix added to the beginning of all category names assigned by this scheme.\n\n   - *Max categories per game:* This is the maximum number of categories that will be assigned to each game. 0 indicates no maximum.\n\n   - *Included tags:* These are the tags you can have added to your games as categories. Only the checked tags will be used. These tags are obtained by scanning the built-in game database. Each tag has a popularity score, shown in brackets after the name.  Click the \">\" button to slide out a panel showing all selected tags.\n\n   - *List options:* These options affect the tags that show up in the list, and the order that they show up in. Click \"Rebuild\" to update the list with the new settings. These settings will not affect which categories are actually added to games when the autocategorization is performed, but they may limit the tags that you have to choose from. They aim to mitigate the difficulty of dealing with a huge list of tags.\n\n   - *Minimum tag score:* Any tags with a lower score than this value will not appear in the list. Each tag's score may depend on the other options in this section.\n\n   - *Weighting factor:* This determines how the tags' popularity scores are calculated. With this set to 1.0, each tag's score is simply the number of times the tag appears across your library. With higher weighting factor values, tags that appear earlier in games' tag list will be given higher scores. There is a detailed example of exactly how this works in the FAQ at the bottom of this readme.\n\n   - *Tags per game:* The number of tags to scan in per game. 0 tells the program to scan all tags for each game. Limiting this can hide some infrequently-applied tags.\n\n   - *Exclude genres:* Remove Steam genre names (Action, Indie, Strategy, etc.) from the tag list.\n\n   - *Owned Only:* Only scan the games that you own. Recommended. With this turned off, you will see all tags for every game in the database.\n   \n - **Release Year:** This lets you assign categories to games based on their release date. You can assign categories for individual years, decades, or half-decades.\n\t\t\n - **User Score:** This lets you categorize games based on user recommendations on the Steam store. To use this method, you must create a set of categories to assign, and define the criteria for a game to be placed in that category. Each game will only be assigned to the category for the first rule that matches it. If a game does not match any rules, it will not be assigned to a category.\n \n - **HLTB:** This lets you categorize games based on the times from http://howlongtobeat.com/ which indicate how long it takes to beat a game. To use this method, you must create a set of categories to assign, and define the criteria for a game to be placed in that category. Each game will only be assigned to the category for the first rule that matches it. If a game does not match any rules, it will not be assigned to a category.\n \n - **DevPub:** Categorize games based on their Developers and/or Publishers.\n \n - **Manual:** Manual manipulation of categories.  For example, use a Filter to gather the subset of games in categories Pool, Football, Baseball & Golf. Add all of those categories to the Remove list, and then add Sports to the Add list.  Running the AutoCat will remove the individual sports categories and place them all in a generic Sports category.\n \n - **Group:**  Place and order multiple AutoCats into a single AutoCat.  Any Filter applied to a group will take precedence over a Filter applied to an AutoCat.\n\n#### Automatic Mode \n\nAutomatic mode lets you run a predetermined set of autocat operations on your game library through the command line or by running a shortcut, without having to use the full Depressurizer interface. You still have to use the full interface to manage the autocat rules themselves. \nFor more information check Tools->Auto Mode Helper.\n \n#### Definitions of Terms and Procedures\n\nWhen you **update** your game list, the program is updating your library of owned games. It will do this either by accessing local Steam config files or by going to your Steam Community profile site, depending on your settings. This does not alter any categories, it only adds games to your list.\n\nWhen you **import** from Steam, the program is loading category and other information from your Steam config file. This is not guaranteed to have entries for all your games, but it includes data for any game that is currently categorized, favorited, or hidden. Note that if Steam is running, the imported data may not be up to date. This step is also where your non-Steam games are loaded, if you have them enabled.\n\nWhen you **save**, you are saving your Depressurizer profile data. By default, this also exports to Steam, but this can be disabled in your profile settings.\n\nWhen you **export**, you are manually pushing your data to Steam. You should close Steam before doing this.\n\n----\n\n### FAQ / Troubleshooting\n\n##### Will this mess up my Steam / get me VAC banned?\n\nNo. The only things that Depressurizer does is to write to your configuration files, and it doesn't do anything that you couldn't do using the client itself.\n\n##### Why does my profile need to be public?\n\nIf you are using the local update option in the profile settings, it does not. If you are only using the web update, the program needs your profile to be public in order to access your game list.\n\n##### Why are some of my games missing, even after I updated my game list?\n\nIt is difficult to precisely determine the exact set of games that show up in the Steam client. The program does the best job I've been able to get it to do so far. If a game is (for some reason) in your game list without your account having a relevant license assigned to it, the local update will not pick it up. If the game does not show up on your community profile page, the web update will not pick it up. If a game is marked as DLC (or anything non-game-like) in the database, it will not get picked up by either of these methods.\n\nTo get unlisted games to show up in the program, you can add them manually by clicking the \"Add Game\" button.\n\nYou can also add them to any category within Steam, then close Steam, then do an Import in Depressurizer. Depending on the problem, this may only work if the \"Bypass auto-ignore...\" option in the profile options screen is enabled.\n\n##### Why do I have extra things like DLC in my game list?\n\nThe program relies on its database to filter out non-game entries. If that database is wrong, extra items might show up. You might also have \"Don't ignore unknown apps\" in the profile settings \"Ignored Games\" tab checked, which can let in a lot of extra stuff.\n\nThe program trusts that any game that it finds in your Steam config file should be there, so if something gets in there (this can easily happen with games that are only in your library temporarily for any reason) it will show up in Depressurizer after an import.\n\nTo remove a specific item, just select it and click \"Delete Game\". This will remove it from your list and (by default) ignore it going forward.\n\n##### Why do some of my games not auto-categorize at all?\n\nThe program database might be out of date. Also, the program relies on the Steam Store data for autocategorization info. Sometimes, a game that is on your account might not HAVE a Store page any more, so the database won't have any data on it.\n\n##### How do I update the database myself?\n\nClick on Tools > Database Editor. Click \"Update App Info\" to pull the latest information from the local Steam cache file (by default this is done on program start anyway). Click \"Fetch List\" to get a list of all Steam apps. Then, click \"Scrape Unscraped\". This might take some time. If you click Stop (NOT CANCEL) it will save what you've gotten so far and you can come back later. Click File > Save to save your changes. \n\n##### What exactly does the weighting factor on the tags autocat dialog do?\n\nOkay. The tag scanner runs through all of your games, and for each game it runs through all of your tags. As it goes, it makes a list of the tags it finds, and for each one, it keeps track of its \"popularity score.\" Each time it sees a tag, it adds a value to its popularity score. If the weighting factor is set to 1.0, this value is always 1, so the score is just the number of times the scan encountered that tag.\n\nHowever, the first tags assigned to a game are the more popular ones, so you might want to give them more weight by increasing the weighting factor. The first tag for each game will always add the weighting factor to that tag's popularity score, and the last tag will always add 1. The tags in the middle add scores that linearly decrease before those values. For example, if a game has five tags (A, B, C, D, E), and the weight factor is set to 3, the scores added to each of those five tags will be: 3.0, 2.5, 2.0, 1.5, 1.0.\n"

  "language": "Python",
  "readme_contents": "PodSixNet - lightweight multiplayer networking library for Python games\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPodSixNet is a lightweight network layer designed to make it easy to write multiplayer games in Python. It uses Python's built in asyncore library and rencode.py (included) to asynchronously serialise network events and arbitrary data structures, and deliver them to your high level classes through simple callback methods.\n\nEach class within your game client which wants to receive network events, subclasses the ConnectionListener class and then implements `Network_*` methods to catch specific user-defined events from the server. You don't have to wait for buffers to fill, or check sockets for waiting data or anything like that, just do `connection.Pump()` once per game loop and the library will handle everything else for you, passing off events to all classes that are listening. Sending data back to the server is just as easy, using `connection.Send(mydata)`. Likewise on the server side, events are propagated to `Network_*` method callbacks and data is sent back to clients with the `client.Send(mydata)` method.\n\nThe [PodSixNet mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/podsixnet) is good for getting help from other users.\n\nFor users of the Construct game making environment for Windows, there is a tutorial on doing multiplayer networking with PodSixNet, [here](http://www.scirra.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=6299). Thanks to Dave Chabo for contributing this tutorial.\n\nHere is [another tutorial by Julian Meyer](http://www.raywenderlich.com/38732/multiplayer-game-programming-for-teens-with-python).\n\nInstall\n-------\n\n`pip install PodSixNet`\n\nor\n\n`easy_install PodSixNet`\n\n\n### From source\n\nFirst make sure you have [Python](http://python.org/) 2.4 or greater installed (python 3 also works).\n\nNext you'll want to get the PodSixNet source.\n\nThe module is found inside a subdirectory called PodSixNet within the top level folder. There's an `__init__.py` inside there, so you can just copy or symlink the PodSixNet sub-directory into your own project and then do `import PodSixNet`, or else you can run `sudo python setup.py install` to install PodSixNet into your Python path. Use `sudo python setup.py develop` if you want to stay up to date with the cutting edge and still be able to svn/bzr up every now and then.\n\nBy default PodSixNet uses a binary encoder to transfer data over the network, but it can optionally use the [JSON](http://json.org/) format or other formats supported by a serialiser which has 'dumps' and 'loads' methods. If you want to serialise your data using JSON you can change the first line of Channel.py to 'from simplejson import dumps, loads' or use the built-in json library in Python 2.6 or higher. This will allow you to write game clients in languages that can't read the 'rencode' binary format, such as Javascript.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nChat example:\n\n * `python examples/ChatServer.py`\n * and a couple of instances of `python examples/ChatClient.py`\n\nWhiteboard example:\n\n * `python examples/WhiteboardServer.py`\n * and a couple of instances of `python examples/WhiteboardClient.py`\n\nLagTime example (measures round-trip time from the server to the client):\n\n * `python examples/LagTimeServer.py`\n * and a couple of instances of `python examples/LagTimeClient.py`\n\nQuick start - Server\n--------------------\n\nYou will need to subclass two classes in order to make your own server. Each time a client connects, a new Channel based class will be created, so you should subclass Channel to make your own server-representation-of-a-client class like this:\n\n```python\nfrom PodSixNet.Channel import Channel\n\nclass ClientChannel(Channel):\n\n    def Network(self, data):\n        print data\n\n    def Network_myaction(self, data):\n        print \"myaction:\", data\n```\n\nWhenever the client does `connection.Send(mydata)`, the `Network()` method will be called. The method `Network_myaction()` will only be called if your data has a key called 'action' with a value of \"myaction\". In other words if it looks something like this:\n\n```python\ndata = {\"action\": \"myaction\", \"blah\": 123, ... }\n```\n\nNext you need to subclass the Server class like this:\n\n```python\n    from PodSixNet.Server import Server\n    \n    class MyServer(Server):\n        \n        channelClass = ClientChannel\n        \n        def Connected(self, channel, addr):\n            print 'new connection:', channel\n```\n\nSet `channelClass` to the channel class that you created above. The method `Connected()` will be called whenever a new client connects to your server. See the example servers for an idea of what you might do each time a client connects. You need to call `Server.Pump()` every now and then, probably once per game loop. For example:\n\n```python\n    myserver = MyServer()\n    while True:\n        myserver.Pump()\n        sleep(0.0001)\n```\n\nWhen you want to send data to a specific client/channel, use the Send method of the Channel class:\n\n```python\nchannel.Send({\"action\": \"hello\", \"message\": \"hello client!\"})\n```\n\nQuick start - Client\n--------------------\n\nTo have a client connect to your new server, you should use the Connection module. See `pydoc Connection` for more details, but here's a summary:\n\n`Connection.connection` is a singleton Channel which connects to the server. You'll only have one of these in your game code, and you'll use it to connect to the server and send messages to the server.\n\n```python\nfrom PodSixNet.Connection import connection\n\n# connect to the server - optionally pass hostname and port like: (\"mccormick.cx\", 31425)\nconnection.Connect()\n\nconnection.Send({\"action\": \"myaction\", \"blah\": 123, \"things\": [3, 4, 3, 4, 7]})\n```\n\nYou'll also need to put the following code once somewhere in your game loop:\n\n```python\nconnection.Pump()\n```\n\nAny time you have an object in your game which you want to receive messages from the server, subclass `ConnectionListener`. For example:\n\n```python\n    from PodSixNet.Connection import ConnectionListener\n    \n    class MyNetworkListener(ConnectionListener):\n    \n        def Network(self, data):\n            print 'network data:', data\n        \n        def Network_connected(self, data):\n            print \"connected to the server\"\n        \n        def Network_error(self, data):\n            print \"error:\", data['error'][1]\n        \n        def Network_disconnected(self, data):\n            print \"disconnected from the server\"\n        \n        def Network_myaction(data):\n            print \"myaction:\", data\n```\n\nJust like in the server case, the network events are received by `Network_*` callback methods, where you should replace '*' with the value in the 'action' key you want to catch. You can implement as many or as few of the above as you like. For example, NetworkGUI would probably only want to listen for the `_connected`, `_disconnected`, and `_error` network events. The data for `_error` always comes in the form of network exceptions, like (111, 'Connection refused') - these are passed straight from the socket layer and are standard socket errors.\n\nAnother class might implement custom methods like `Network_myaction()`, which will receive any data that gets sent from the server with an 'action' key that has the name 'myaction'. For example, the server might send a message with the number of players currently connected like so:\n\n```python\nchannel.Send({\"action\": \"numplayers\", \"players\": 10})\n```\n\nAnd the listener would look like this:\n\n```python\n    from PodSixNet.Connection import ConnectionListener\n    \n    class MyPlayerListener(ConnectionListener):\n    \n        def Network_numplayers(data):\n            # update gui element displaying the number of currently connected players\n            print data['players']\n```\n\nYou can subclass `ConnectionListener` as many times as you like in your application, and every class you make which subclasses it will receive the network events via named Network callbacks. You should call the `Pump()` method on each object you instantiate once per game loop:\n\n```python\n    gui = MyPlayerListener()\n    while 1:\n        connection.Pump()\n        gui.Pump()\n```\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright [Chris McCormick](http://mccormick.cx/), 2009-2015.\n\nPodSixNet is licensed under the terms of the LGPL v3.0 or higher. See the file called [COPYING](COPYING) for details.\n\nThis basically means that you can use it in most types of projects (commercial or otherwise), but if you make changes to the PodSixNet code you must make the modified code available with the distribution of your software. Hopefully you'll tell us about it so we can incorporate your changes. I am not a lawyer, so please read the license carefully to understand your rights with respect to this code.\n\nWhy not use Twisted instead?\n---------------------------\n\nTwisted is a fantastic library for writing robust network code. I have used it in several projects in the past, and it was quite nice to work with. That said, Twisted:\n\n* wants to steal the mainloop\n* is bloated not KISS (it implements many many different protocols)\n* has a weird template launching language when Python should do just fine\n* is not written 100% for the specfic use-case of multiplayer games\n\nThese are some of the reasons why I decided to write a library that is lightweight, has no dependencies except Python, and is dedicated 100% to the task of multiplayer game networking.\n\n"

It's currently calculated this way: [((AspectRatio) / (4.0 / 3.0)) \\* 2.5](<https://www.google.com/search?q=((2560/1080)+/+(4.0+/+3.0))+*+2.5>). Find out what that value is for your resolution using this [link](<https://www.google.com/search?q=((2560/1080)+/+(4.0+/+3.0))+*+2.5>) (e.g. for `2560x1080`, `CameraZoomFactor = 4.44`) and set `CameraZoomFactor` to anything less than that (e.g. for `2560x1080`, `CameraZoomFactor = 3.8`).\n\n[Download](http://thirteenag.github.io/wfp#gta2)\n|\n[Source](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/WidescreenFixesPack/blob/master/source/GTA2.WidescreenFix/dllmain.cpp)\n|\n[Default INI

Supports standard and **Mono** builds!\n\n## Contents\n- [How it works](#how-it-works)\n- [Setting Up Export Presets](#setting-up-export-presets)\n- [Workflow Configuration](#workflow-configuration)\n  - [Example Configuration](#example-configuration)\n  - [Mono Builds](#mono-builds)\n  - [Android Builds](#android-builds)\n- [Custom Editor Settings](#custom-editor-settings)\n- [Tips](#tips)\n  - [Supply custom editor settings](#supplying-a-custom-editor-settings-file)\n  - [Setup Windows Icons](#setup-windows-icons)\n- [Example Projects](#example-projects)\n\n## How it Works\n\nThis action automatically reads your `export_presets.cfg` file to determine which builds to make. Whenever this action runs each of your defined exports will run. The resulting executables can then be optionally attached to a release. See [the example configuration](#example-configuration).\n\n## Setting Up Export Presets\nDefine at least 1 export preset by going to `Project -> Export` in the Godot editor and creating a configuration. Set the file name in the \"Export Path\" box. This is how the action knows how to name your binary. Notice how the below image has \"win.exe\" in the \"Export Path\" for my windows export. Your executables can be named however you like, as long as they include the appropriate extension `.exe`, `.x86_64`, etc.\n![](docs/exports.png)\n\n**NOTE**: The file extension for the Mac OSX export must be anything but `.zip` for versions of Godot before 3.2. If the Mac OSX export file extension is `.zip` for a Godot version earlier than 3.2, then your project source files will be exported instead of a Mac application. [This was a known issue with the Godot command line export](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/23073). For reference, I used a `.z` file extension to make it work for my Mac OSX builds.\n\n## Workflow Configuration\n\n### Action Inputs\n\n| Input Name                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Type      | Default | Required |\n| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- | ------- | -------- |\n| `godot_executable_download_url`       | The **Linux Headless** version of Godot that you want to use to export your project.

This example workflow could be defined in `.github/workflows/main.yml`. For more information about defining workflows see [the workflow docs](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/configuring-a-workflow).\n\nThis workflow will export your game when a tag is pushed, archive the files, and create a release containing the archives.\n\n```yml\n# Whenever a tag push matching pattern \"v*\" then run the job\non: \n  push:\n    tags:\n      - \"v*\"\n\njobs:\n  # job id, can be anything\n  export_game:\n    # Always use ubuntu-latest for this action\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    # Job name, can be anything\n    name: Export Game\n    steps:\n      # Always include the checkout step so that \n      # your project is available for Godot to export\n    - name: checkout\n      uses: actions/checkout@v3.0.2\n      # Ensure that you get the entire project history\n      with:\n        fetch-depth: 0\n  \n    # Automatically stores the tag name for later use\n    - name: get tag from version\n        id: tag_version\n        run: |\n          echo ::set-output name=TAG_VERSION::${GITHUB_REF#refs/tags/v}\n  \n    - name: export game\n      id: export\n      # Use latest version (see releases for all versions)\n      uses: firebelley/godot-export@v4.1.0\n      with:\n        # Defining all the required inputs\n        godot_executable_download_url: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases/download/3.4.4-stable/Godot_v3.4.4-stable_linux_headless.64.zip\n        godot_export_templates_download_url: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases/download/3.4.4-stable/Godot_v3.4.4-stable_export_templates.tpz\n        relative_project_path: ./\n        archive_output: true\n\n      # This release action has worked well for me. However, you can most likely use any release action of your choosing.\n      # https://github.com/softprops/action-gh-release\n    - name: create release\n      uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v0.1.14\n      with:\n        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        generate_release_notes: true\n        tag_name: ${{ steps.tag_version.outputs.TAG_VERSION }}\n        files: ${{ steps.export.outputs.archive_directory }}/*\n```\n\n## Custom Editor Settings\nSome Godot configurations are editor-based and not project-based. This includes items like Android paths. This repository provides a [base editor settings](./dist/editor_settings-3.tres) that will be used by default when exporting your games. However, you can supply a custom editor settings configuration file by simply copying your custom editor settings file to `~/.config/godot/editor_settings-3.tres` _before_ this action runs. This action will not overwrite an existing `editor_settings-3.tres` file.\n\n## Mono Builds\nMono builds do not require additional configuration. However, if you want to change the build tool that is used (currently defaults to `dotnet cli`) then you need to [supply your own editor settings](#custom-editor-settings) with the line `mono/builds/build_tool`. This value corresponds to the build tool dropdown in the editor settings window at `Editor Settings -> Mono -> Builds -> Build Tool`. You can look at your local `editor_settings-3.tres` to see what this value should be if you want to match the build tool used during local development.\n\n## Android Builds\nFor Android builds, use the [setup-android](https://github.com/android-actions/setup-android) action before this one in your workflow. [The default editor settings file](./dist/editor_settings-3.tres) used by this action already provides a default path to the Android SDK. If your path is different then [supply your own editor settings file](#custom-editor-settings).\n\n\n## Tips\n\n### Supplying a Custom Editor Settings File\nInclude the following step before this action. For example:\n```yml\n# Above this line is the workflow job setup\n- name: use custom editor settings\n  run: |\n    mkdir -p ~/.config/godot\n    cp ~/path/to/my/editor_settings-3.tres ~/.config/godot/\n# Note that you can use ${{ github.workspace }} to get the default location of your checked-out repository\n# Use firebelley/godot-export sometime after the above step\n```\n\n### Setup Windows Icons\nIn order to configure this action to update your game's Windows exe icon, include the following configuration:\n```yml\n- name: install wine\n  id: wine_install\n  run: |\n    sudo apt install wine64\n    echo ::set-output name=WINE_PATH::$(which wine64)\n\n# Any other intermediate steps can go here\n\n- name: export game\n  uses: firebelley/godot-export@v4.1.0\n  with:\n    # ...supply your other options here\n    wine_path: ${{ steps.wine_install.outputs.WINE_PATH }} # set the wine path here which is the output of the wine_install step\n```\n\n### Example Projects\nSee the [example projects](./examples/README.md) for more info.\n"

further testing needed, example devmania2012veh pre 2012-10-12\n\nweb api available:\n* if (love.web) then ... end\n* love.web.javascript(\"jsfun()\")\n* if (string.find(love.web.getAgent(),\"MSIE\")) then ...mp3... else ...ogg... end\n* love.web.setMaxFPS(99) -- default 60, stepper interval\n* love.web.showPreCompiledJS(\"map.lua\") -- shows a html textbox with the lua file converted to javascript, useful for loading big (several mb) files in firefox without parser hang, see ludumdare201204 for example\n* if (love.web.browserIsFirefox() or love.web.browserIsChrome()) then ... end\n"

That means that you can use it straight in those engines, without need to save files and open files and so on. It's directly integratedin their workflow!\n\n- Gdevelop : A full-featured, open-source game development software, allowing to create HTML5 and native games without any knowledge in a specific programming language. All the game logic is built up using an intuitive and powerful event-based system.\nhttps://github.com/4ian/GDevelop\n\n\n# \ud83e\udde0 Yarn runtimes\nThe runtime is a library that allows your game engine to parse the files that yarn creates. There are a couple of popular ones that you can use. If you have created a runtime, you are working on one or want to get one included with your game engine, these can be of some use to you\n\n- YarnSpinner : A C# library for interactive dialogue in games! Ideal  if you are using Unity3d or another C# game engine!\nhttps://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner\n\n- Bondagejs : A Javascript-based parser for the Yarn dialogue tree markup language. Ideal if your game engine uses html5 technologies to run (Gdevelop and ctjs use it).\nhttps://github.com/hylyh/bondage.js\n\n- GDYarn : A Yarn runtime for Godot engine - completely written in Gdscript\nhttps://github.com/kyperbelt/GDYarn\n\n- Chatterbox : Yarn runtime implementation for Game maker 2+\nhttps://github.com/JujuAdams/Chatterbox\n\n# Other implementations of Yarn Editor\n- Crochet : Fork of YarnEditor\nhttps://github.com/FaultyFunctions/Crochet/\n\n- YarnSpinner Loom vscode extension : implementation of YarnEditor as a vscode extension\nhttps://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TranquilMarmot.yarn-spinner-loom\n\n# \ud83d\udc2c Features \ud83e\udd84\n\n### Portability\n- Yarn Classic has PWA version you can install and run when offline, which has a much smaller footprint than other editors using electron.\n- The pwa can run on mobile devices with smaller screens - you can use it on your phone and it's much easier to install.\n- There is of course also an electron version of the editor, which is slower on updates but more stable\n\n### BBcode and HTML-ish markup styling in editor, Spellchecking, Autocompletion, and more!\n- Optional syntax autocompletion (autoclose tags)\n- preview of bbcode/html tag effects and goto in trimmed nodes\n- optional word guessing and autocompletion\n- optional preview bbcode in editor mode\n- a color picker (using spectrum.js) to set font color in bbcode\n- emoji picker to insert emojis\n- nodelink suggestions as you type in the right places\n- Night mode - Toggling it will invert all the light colors which the editor currently uses\n- A context menu command to visit other nodes via their links in the editor and even create new ones\n- Button to go back to the previous edited node. If there is no previous - save and close the current one\n![yarn-0 3 5-newfeatures](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6495061/50045609-b646e900-008d-11e9-9f17-2ac6b01908f6.gif)\n\n### Language, writing and debugging tools built right into it (Yarn and Ink)\n- Ability to playtest [Yarn](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner) and [Ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink) stories you are working on - straight inside the editor\n![Screenshot](doc/inkPlaytest.gif)\n- Spellchecking of words (supported for different languages too)\n- misspelled word suggestions in the new context menu - if you have selected a misspelled word\n- Similar word suggestion for highlighted words (supported for english only)\n- Transcribe text - ability to \"talk\" to yarn without using hands :o (multi-language supported)\n- Yarn can also talk to you - tell you what is written (multi-language supported)\n- Support for compilation and debugging of ink files via the wasm port inklecate. It catches the error and opens the knot containing it when exporting or testing!\n![Screenshot](doc/inkErrorReporting.gif)\n\n### Load and Save your yarns from your computer, github gists or anything you can send it to on your tablet/phone\n- A variety of export formats supported - yarn, json yarn, twee, twee2, xml\n- When used from a mobile device, yarn can send its data to any other app, including to google drive\n- Ability to store and load all your yarns using a github gist - private or public, doesn't matter ;)\n\n### Customization!\n- Support for different themes (you can make your own too)\n\n# Electron Builds\nWin64, Linux and MacOS builds available at: https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnEditor/releases/latest\n\n# \u2699\ufe0f Compile and run web app on localhost:\nMake sure you have nodejs installed.

Don't forget to `chmod +x` it on Linux/macOS.\n\nThe Windows .exe and Linux/macOS executable were created with PyInstaller and will run standalone even without python being installed.\nNote that on Linux glibc >= 2.25 is required, so older distributions such as Ubuntu 16.04 or Debian stretch will not work.\n\n### Python Package (any)\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\nTo prevent problems with permissions during installation, please upgrade your `pip` by running `python -m pip install -U pip --user`. \n\n> **Tip:** You may need to replace `python` in the above command with `python3` on Linux/macOS, or `py -3` on Windows.\n\n#### Installation from PyPI (recommended)\n\nLegendary is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/legendary-gl/), to install simply run:\n\n```bash\npip install legendary-gl\n```\n\nOptionally if logging in via an embedded web view is desired also run\n```bash\npip install legendary-gl[webview]\n```\nOn Linux this may also require installing a supported web engine and its python bindings.  \nUbunutu example:\n```bash\nsudo apt install python3-gi-cairo\npip install legendary-gl[webview]\n```\n\nAlternatively `pip install legendary-gl[webview_gtk]` or `pip install pywebview[gtk]` will work\nbut may require manually installing dependencies needed to build `PyGObject`.\n\n**Note:** Using pywebview's Qt engine may not work correctly. Using pywebview is currently unsupported on macOS.\n\n#### Manually from the repo\n\n- Install python3.9, setuptools, wheel, and requests\n- Clone the git repository and cd into it\n- Run `pip install .`\n\n#### Ubuntu 20.04 example\n\nUbuntu 20.04's standard repositories include everything needed to install legendary:\n````bash\nsudo apt install python3 python3-requests python3-setuptools-git\ngit clone https://github.com/derrod/legendary.git\ncd legendary\npip install .\n````\n\nIf the `legendary` executable is not available after installation, you may need to configure your `PATH` correctly. You can do this by running the command: \n\n```bash\necho 'export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin' >> ~/.profile && source ~/.profile\n```\n\n### Directly from the repo (for dev/testing)\n\n- Install python3.9 and requests (optionally in a venv)\n- cd into the repository\n- Run `pip install -e .`\n\nThis installs `legendary` in \"editable\" mode - any changes to the source code will take effect next time the `legendary` executable runs.\n\n## Quickstart\n\n**Tip:** When using PowerShell with the standalone executable, you may need to replace `legendary` with `.\\legendary` in the commands below.\n\nTo log in:\n````\nlegendary auth\n````\nWhen using the prebuilt Windows executables of version 0.20.14 or higher this should open a new window with the Epic Login.\n\nOtherwise, authentication is a little finicky since we have to go through the Epic website and manually copy a code.\nThe login page should open in your browser and after logging in you should be presented with a JSON response that contains a code (\"sid\"), just copy the code into the terminal and hit enter.\n\nAlternatively you can use the `--import` flag to import the authentication from the Epic Games Launcher (manually specifying the used WINE prefix may be required on Linux).\nNote that this will log you out of the Epic Launcher.\n\nListing your games\n````\nlegendary list\n````\nThis will fetch a list of games available on your account, the first time may take a while depending on how many games you have.\n\nInstalling a game\n````\nlegendary install Anemone\n````\n**Note:** the name used here is generally the game's \"app name\" as seen in the games list rather than its title, but as of 0.20.12 legendary will try to match game names or abbreviations thereof as well. In this case `legendary install world of goo` or `legendary install wog` would also work!\n\nList installed games and check for updates\n````\nlegendary list-installed --check-updates\n````\n\nLaunch (run) a game with online authentication\n````\nlegendary launch \"world of goo\"\n````\n**Tip:** most games will run fine offline (`--offline`), and thus won't require launching through legendary for online authentication.\nYou can run `legendary launch <App Name> --offline --dry-run` to get a command line that will launch the game with all parameters that would be used by the Epic Launcher.\nThese can then be entered into any other game launcher (e.g. Lutris/Steam) if the game requires them.\n\nImporting a previously installed game\n````\nlegendary import Anemone /mnt/games/Epic/WorldOfGoo\n````\n**Note:** Importing will require a full verification so Legendary can correctly update the game later.  \n**Note 2:** In order to use an alias here you may have to put it into quotes if if contains more than one word, e.g. `legendary import-game \"world of goo\" /mnt/games/Epic/WorldOfGoo`.\n\nSync savegames with the Epic Cloud\n````\nlegendary sync-saves\n````\n**Note:** When this command is run the first time after a supported game has been installed it will ask you to confirm or provide the path to where the savegame is located.\n\nAutomatically sync all games with the Epic Games Launcher\n````\nlegendary -y egl-sync\n````\n\n## Usage\n\n````\nusage: legendary [-h] [-H] [-v] [-y] [-V] [-J] [-A <seconds>] <command>

  "readme_contents": "[![crates.io](http://meritbadge.herokuapp.com/ultraviolet)](https://crates.io/crates/ultraviolet)\n[![docs.rs](https://docs.rs/ultraviolet/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/ultraviolet)\n\n# `ultraviolet`\n\nThis is a crate to computer-graphics and games-related linear and geometric algebra, but *fast*, both in terms\nof productivity and in terms of runtime performance.\n\nIn terms of productivity, ultraviolet uses no generics and is designed to be as straightforward\nof an interface as possible, resulting in fast compilation times and clear code. In addition, the\nlack of generics and Rust type-system \"hacks\" result in clear and concise errors that are easy to\nparse and fix for the user.\n\nIn terms of runtime performance, ultraviolet was designed from the start with performance in mind.\nTo do so, we provide two separate kinds of each type, each with nearly identical functionality,\none with usual scalar f32 values, and the other a 'wide' type which uses SIMD f32x4 vectors for\neach value. This design is clear and explicit in intent, and it also allows code to\ntake full advantage of SIMD.\n\nThe 'wide' types use an \"SoA\" (Structure of Arrays) architecture\nsuch that each wide data structure actually contains the data for 4 or 8 of its associated data type and will do any operation\non all of the simd 'lanes' at the same time. For example, a `Vec3x8` is equivalent to 8 `Vec3`s all bundled together into one\ndata structure.\n\nDoing this is potentially *much* (factor of 10) faster than an standard \"AoS\" (Array of Structs) layout,\nthough it does depend on your workload and algorithm requirements. Algorithms must be carefully architected to take full advantage\nof this, and doing so can be easier said than done, especially if your algorithm involves significant branching.\n\n`ultraviolet` was the first Rust math library to be designed in this \"AoSoA\" manner, though\n`nalgebra` now supports it for several of their data structures as well.\n\n## Benchmarks\n\nSee [`mathbench-rs`](https://github.com/bitshifter/mathbench-rs) for latest benchmarks (may not be fully up-to-date with git master).\n\n## Cargo Features\n\nTo help further improve build times, `ultraviolet` puts various functionality under feature flags. For example, the 2d and 3d projective geometric algebras\nas well as f64 and integer types are disabled by default. In order to enable them, enable the corresponding crate feature flags in your `Cargo.toml`. For example:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nultraviolet = { version = \"0.6\", features = [ \"f64\", \"int\" ] }\n```\n\nWill enable the `f64` and `int` features. Here's a list of the available features:\n\n* `f64` - Enable f64 bit wide floating point support. Naming convention is `D[Type]`, such as `DVec3x4` would be a collection of 4 3d vectors with f64 precision each.\n* `int` - Enable integer vector types.\n* `serde` - Enable Serialize and Deserialize implementations for many scalar types.\n* `mint` - Enable interoperation with other math libraries through the `mint` interface\n* `bytemuck` - Enable casting of many types to byte arrays, for use with graphics APIs.\n\n## Crate Features\n\nThis crate is currently being dogfooded in my ray tracer [`rayn`](https://github.com/termhn/rayn),\nand is being used by various independent Rust game developers for various projects.\nIt does what those users have currently needed it to do.\n\nThere are a couple relatively unique/novel features in this library, the most important being the use of the Geometric Algebra.\n\nInstead of implementing complex number algebra (for 2d rotations) and Quaternion algebra (for 3d rotations), we use\nRotors, a concept taken from Geometric Algebra, to represent 2d and 3d rotations.\n\nWhat this means for the programmer is that you will be using the `Rotor3` type in place of\na Quaternion, though you can expect it to do basically all the same things that a Quaternion does. In fact, Quaternions\nare directly isomorphic to Rotors (meaning they are in essense the same thing, just formulated differently). The reason this decision was made was twofold:\nfirst, the derivation of the math is actually quite simple to understand. All the derivations for the code implemented in the Rotor structs in this\nlibrary are written out in the `derivations` folder of the GitHub repo; I derived them manually as part of the implementation.\n\nOn the other hand, Quaternions are often basically just seen as black boxes that we programmers use to do rotations because\nthey have some nice properties, but that we don't really understand. You can use Rotors this same way, but you can also easily\nunderstand them. Second is that in some sense they can be seen as 'more correct' than Quaternions. Specifically, they\nfacilitate a more proper understanding of rotation as being something that occurs *within a plane* rather than something\nthat occurs *around an axis*, as it is generally thought. Finally, Rotors also generalize to 4 and even higher dimensions,\nand if someone wants to they could implement a Rotor4 which retains all the properties of a Rotor3/Quaternion but does rotation\nin 4 dimensions instead, something which simply is not possible to do with Quaternions.\n\nIf it's missing something you need it to do, bug me on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/termhn/ultraviolet/issues) and/or Rust community discord server\n(I'm Fusha there) and I'll try to add it for you, if I believe it fits with the vision of the lib :)\n\n## Examples\n\n### Euler Integration\n\n[Euler Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method) is a method for numerically solving ordinary differential equations. If that sounds complicated, don't worry! The details of the method don't matter if you're not looking to implement any kind of physics simulation but this method is common in games. Keep reading for the code below!\n\nThe point is that if you are doing the same basic math operations on multiple floating point values with no conditionals (no `if`s), porting to wide data types and parallel processing is quite simple.\n\nHere is the scalar example of Euler Integration:\n\n```rust\nfn integrate(\n    pos: &mut [uv::Vec3],\n    vel: &mut [uv::Vec3],\n    acc: &[uv::Vec3],\n    dt: f32,\n) {\n    for ((position, velocity), acceleration) in pos.iter_mut().zip(vel).zip(acc) {\n        *velocity = *velocity + *acceleration * dt;\n        *position = *position + *velocity * dt;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe code loops over each set of corresponding position, velocity, and acceleration vectors. It first adjusts the velocity by the acceleration scaled by the amount of time that has passed and then adjusts the position by the velocity scaled by the amount of time that has passed.\n\nThese are all multiplication, addition, and assignment operators that need to be applied in the same way to all of the variables in question.\n\nTo port this function to wide data types and parallel processing, all we have to do is change the data types and we're done! The new function looks like this:\n\n```rust\nfn integrate_x8(\n    pos: &mut [uv::Vec3x8],\n    vel: &mut [uv::Vec3x8],\n    acc: &[uv::Vec3x8],\n    dt: f32x8,\n) {\n    for ((position, velocity), acceleration) in pos.iter_mut().zip(vel).zip(acc) {\n        *velocity = *velocity + *acceleration * dt;\n        *position = *position + *velocity * dt;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis function now processes 8 sets of vectors in parallel and brings significant speed gains!\n\nThe only caveat is that the calling code that creates the slices of vectors needs to be modified to populate these wide data types with 8 sets of values instead of just one. The scalar code for that looks like this:\n\n```rust\nlet mut pos: Vec<uv::Vec3> = Vec::with_capacity(100);\nlet mut vel: Vec<uv::Vec3> = Vec::with_capacity(100);\nlet mut acc: Vec<uv::Vec3> = Vec::with_capacity(100);\n\n// You would probably write these constant values in-line but\n// they are here for illustrative purposes\nlet pos_x = 1.0f32;\nlet pos_y = 2.0f32;\nlet pos_z = 3.0f32;\n\nlet vel_x = 4.0f32;\nlet vel_y = 5.0f32;\nlet vel_z = 6.0f32;\n\nlet acc_x = 7.0f32;\nlet acc_y = 8.0f32;\nlet acc_z = 9.0f32;\n\nfor ((position, velocity), acceleration) in pos.iter_mut().zip(vel).zip(acc) {\n    pos.push(uv::Vec3::new(pos_x, pos_y, pos_z));\n    vel.push(uv::Vec3::new(vel_x, vel_y, vel_z));\n    acc.push(uv::Vec3::new(acc_x, acc_y, acc_z));\n}\n```\n\nWhereas to populate the same for the 8-lane wide `Vec3x8` data type, the code could look like this:\n\n```rust\nlet mut pos: Vec<uv::Vec3x8> = Vec::with_capacity(100 / 8 + 1);\nlet mut vel: Vec<uv::Vec3x8> = Vec::with_capacity(100 / 8 + 1);\nlet mut acc: Vec<uv::Vec3x8> = Vec::with_capacity(100 / 8 + 1);\n\nlet pos_x = uv::f32x8::splat(1.0f32);\nlet pos_y = uv::f32x8::splat(2.0f32);\nlet pos_z = uv::f32x8::splat(3.0f32);\n\nlet vel_x = uv::f32x8::splat(4.0f32);\nlet vel_y = uv::f32x8::splat(5.0f32);\nlet vel_z = uv::f32x8::splat(6.0f32);\n\nlet acc_x = uv::f32x8::splat(7.0f32);\nlet acc_y = uv::f32x8::splat(8.0f32);\nlet acc_z = uv::f32x8::splat(9.0f32);\n\nfor ((position, velocity), acceleration) in pos.iter_mut().zip(vel).zip(acc) {\n    pos.push(uv::Vec3x8::new(pos_x, pos_y, pos_z));\n    vel.push(uv::Vec3x8::new(vel_x, vel_y, vel_z));\n    acc.push(uv::Vec3x8::new(acc_x, acc_y, acc_z));\n}\n```\n\nNote that `100 / 8` in maths terms would be `12.5`, but we can't conveniently have a half-sized `Vec3x8`.\n\nThere are various ways to handle these 'remainder' vectors. You could fall back to scalar code, or progressively fall back to narrower wide types, such as `Vec3x4`, or you can just consider whether the cost of calculating a few additional vectors that you won't use is worth adding complexity to your code.\n\n### Ray-Sphere Intersection\n\nScalar code that operates on a single value at a time needs some restructuring to take advantage of SIMD and the 4-/8-wide data types.\n\nBelow is an example of scalar ray-sphere instersection code using `Vec3` for points and vectors:\n\n```rust\nfn ray_sphere_intersect(\n    ray_o: uv::Vec3,\n    ray_d: uv::Vec3,\n    sphere_o: uv::Vec3,\n    sphere_r_sq: f32,\n) -> f32 {\n    let oc = ray_o - sphere_o;\n    let b = oc.dot(ray_d);\n    let c = oc.mag_sq() - sphere_r_sq;\n    let descrim = b * b - c;\n\n    if descrim > 0.0 {\n        let desc_sqrt = descrim.sqrt();\n\n        let t1 = -b - desc_sqrt;\n        if t1 > 0.0 {\n            t1\n        } else {\n            let t2 = -b + desc_sqrt;\n            if t2 > 0.0 {\n                t2\n            } else {\n                f32::MAX\n            }\n        }\n    } else {\n        f32::MAX\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis porting guide will not discuss the details of the algorithm, but will focus on how to convert the code to apply parallel SIMD operations on wide data types.\n\nThe first thing to do is to convert the parameter and return types from scalar `Vec3` to wide `Vec3x8` and `f32x8`:\n\n```rust\nfn ray_sphere_intersect_x8(\n    ray_o: uv::Vec3x8,\n    ray_d: uv::Vec3x8,\n    sphere_o: uv::Vec3x8,\n    sphere_r_sq: uv::f32x8,\n) -> uv::f32x8 {\n```\n\nEach call to the function will process 8 ray-sphere intersections in parallel. The first four lines of the function remain the same:\n\n```rust\n    let oc = ray_o - sphere_o;\n    let b = oc.dot(ray_d);\n    let c = oc.mag_sq() - sphere_r_sq;\n    let descrim = b * b - c;\n```\n\nDespite this code being the same, the calculations for 8 rays and spheres will be carried out at the same time!\n\nThe next line of the scalar code tests the value of `descrim` to see if it is greater than `0.0`. When operating on 8 values at a time, the code cannot branch along two separate paths because the value of `descrim` for each of the 8 values may cause branching to different sets of operations. To support this we would need to convert back to scalar code and then we lose all the performance benefits of parallel processing.\n\nSo, how do we convert this? We have a tradeoff to consider depending on the frequency of divergence, that is depending on how often the branch will follow one or the other path. If it is very likely for the given data and algorithm that the majority of branches will take one path, we can check whether all lanes take that path and then branch based on that. Such a bias toward one branch path is relatively rare, and in the case of this algorithm it is common to branch either way so this approach would produce slower code.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the results for both branches for all 8 lanes, and then filter the results with masks that select the correct values from the possibilities at the end.\n\nTo create the mask for 8 lanes of `descrim` values with `0.0`:\n\n```rust\n    let desc_pos = descrim.cmp_gt(uv::f32x8::splat(0.0));\n```\n\nIn the true case of the original scalar version, we then have more arithmetic operations that end up looking the exact same when we do them on the vectorized version:\n\n```rust\n    let desc_sqrt = descrim.sqrt();\n\n    let t1 = -b - desc_sqrt;\n```\n\nAnd now in the scalar code we have another branch based on `t1 > 0.0`, so we apply the same technique, with a little bit extra:\n\n```rust\n    let t1_valid = t1.cmp_gt(uv::f32x8::splat(0.0)) & desc_pos;\n```\n\nThe `& desc_pos` at the end does a bitwise and operation to combine the masks that say whether each of the lanes of `t1 > 0.0` are true or false, with those of whether each of the lanes of `descrim > 0.0` were true or false, and if both are true for a lane, then the mask value will be true for that lane in `t1_mask`, otherwise the value for the lane will be `false`. This is combining the nested logic.\n\nThe true case of the `t1 > 0.0` condition just returns `t1`, but the false case has some more calculation and branching that can be ported in a similar way:\n\n```rust\n    let t2 = -b + desc_sqrt;\n    let t2_valid = t2.cmp_gt(uv::f32x8::splat(0.0)) & desc_pos;\n```\n\nThis may sound like it could be slower than scalar code because this algorithm being applied to wide data types is doing all the calculations for both branches regardless of which is true, and you would be right!\n\nThis approach is indeed a tradeoff and depends on the likelihood of branching one way or the other, and the cost of calculation of the branches. However, even with an algorithm that is particularly branch-heavy like the ray-sphere intersection we're analyzing here, in practice, the benefits of being able to calculate multiple pieces of data simultaneously often results in a net win! As with all optimization, measurement tells the truth.\n\nAt this point, we have ported almost the entire algorithm. We have values for `t1` and `t2` for each of the 8 lanes. We have mask values in `t1_valid` that indicate whether both `descrim > 0.0 && t1 > 0.0` for each lane. And we have `t2_valid` with values indicating exactly `descrim > 0.0 && t2 > 0.0`. When the scalar code does not return `t1` or `t2`, it returns `f32::MAX`. How do we now select the correct return value for each of the lanes?\n\n`ultraviolet` has a `blend` function on the mask types that uses the true or false values for each of the lanes to select from the calculated values for the true and false cases. So if `a` were a wide vector of values that would be calculated in the true case of a branch, and `b` were for the false case, with a mask `m` we could select from `a` and `b` based on `m` by calling `m.blend(a, b)` and the result would be the desired output values!\n\nLet's try to apply that to the scalar code by looking just at its logical control flow:\n\n```rust\n    if descrim > 0.0 {\n        if t1 > 0.0 {\n            t1\n        } else {\n            if t2 > 0.0 {\n                t2\n            } else {\n                f32::MAX\n            }\n        }\n    } else {\n        f32::MAX\n    }\n```\n\nSo if we take the outer-most if condition..\n\n```rust\n   let t = t1_valid.blend(t1, ???);\n```\n\nWhat is the value for false case of the `descrim > 0.0 && t1 > 0.0` test? There are two possibilities - either `descrim <= 0.0`, which is the false case of the `descrim > 0.0` condition, or `descrim > 0.0 && t1 <= 0.0` which is the else case where we handle `t2`. This looks complicated. Let's try looking at the `descrim > 0.0 && t2 > 0.0` case in the scalar code and try `blend`ing that:\n\n```rust\n    let t = t2_valid.blend(t2, uv::f32x8::splat(std::f32::MAX));\n```\n\nSo `descrim > 0.0 && t2 > 0.0` has two false cases, either `descrim <= 0.0` and we want to return `f32::MAX`, or `descrim > 0.0 && t2 <= 0.0` and we want to return `f32::MAX`, so we can `blend` to select the correct values here to cover the false case of the scalar `descrim > 0.0` condition, and the false case of the `t1 > 0.0` condition, that leaves only the true case of the `t1 > 0.0` condition left to resolve...\n\nAnd that is exactly what `t1_valid.blend(t1, ???)` would select! So we can combine the two blends like this:\n\n```rust\n    let t = t2_valid.blend(t2, uv::f32x8::splat(std::f32::MAX));\n    let t = t1_valid.blend(t1, t);\n```\n\n`t` now contains `t1`, `t2` or `f32::MAX` as appropriate for each of the lanes! We have completed the port of the scalar algorithm code to leverage SIMD operations on 8-lane wide data types to calculate 8 ray-sphere intersections in parallel!\n\nBelow is the full example of the same ray-sphere intersection algorithm implemented using the wide `Vec3x8` type:\n\n```rust\nfn ray_sphere_intersect_x8(\n    sphere_o: uv::Vec3x8,\n    sphere_r_sq: uv::f32x8,\n    ray_o: uv::Vec3x8,\n    ray_d: uv::Vec3x8,\n) -> uv::f32x8 {\n    let oc = ray_o - sphere_o;\n    let b = oc.dot(ray_d);\n    let c = oc.mag_sq() - sphere_r_sq;\n    let descrim = b * b - c;\n\n    let desc_pos = descrim.cmp_gt(uv::f32x8::splat(0.0));\n\n    let desc_sqrt = descrim.sqrt();\n\n    let t1 = -b - desc_sqrt;\n    let t1_valid = t1.cmp_gt(uv::f32x8::splat(0.0)) & desc_pos;\n\n    let t2 = -b + desc_sqrt;\n    let t2_valid = t2.cmp_gt(uv::f32x8::splat(0.0)) & desc_pos;\n\n    let t = t2_valid.blend(t2, uv::f32x8::splat(std::f32::MAX));\n    let t = t1_valid.blend(t1, t);\n\n    t\n}\n```\n"

Suddenly, a creature jumped from behind an ice bush, there\nwas a flash, and Tux fell asleep!\n\nWhen Tux wakes up, he finds that Penny is missing. Where she lay\nbefore now lies a letter:\n>Tux, my arch enemy! I have captured your beautiful Penny and have\n>taken her to my fortress. The path to my fortress is littered with my\n>minions. Give up on the thought of trying to reclaim her, you haven't\n>got a chance!\n>\n>-Nolok\n\nTux looks and sees Nolok's fortress in the distance. Determined to\nsave his beloved Penny, he begins his journey.\n\n## Installation\n\nFor major platforms, stable releases are built and available for download from\n[supertux.org](https://www.supertux.org/download.html) or alternatively directly\nfrom [GitHub](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/releases). You should be able\nto install these using default tools provided by your platform. On macOS, when\nGatekeeper is enabled (default) it will refuse to open SuperTux. This is due to\nthe lack of a signature on the application. If you wish to open SuperTux anyway\nwithout disabling the Gatekeeper feature entirely, you can open the application\nfrom the context menu (control click on the icon). macOS will then remember your\nchoice the next time.\n\n## Documentation\n\nImportant documentation for SuperTux is contained in multiple files.\nPlease see them:\n\n* `INSTALL.md` - Requirements, compiling and installing.\n* `README.md` - This file\n* `NEWS.md` - Changes since the previous versions of SuperTux.\n* `LICENSE.txt` - The GNU General Public License, under whose terms SuperTux is\nlicensed. (Most of the data subdirectory is also licensed under\nCC-by-SA)\n* `data/credits.stxt` - Credits for people that contributed to the creation of\nSuperTux. (You can view these in the game menu as well.)\n\n\n## Playing the game\n\nBoth keyboards and joysticks/gamepads are supported. You can change\nthe controls via the Options menu. Basically, the only keys you will\nneed to use in-game are to do the following actions: jump, duck,\nright, left, action and 'P' to pause/unpause the game. There isn't much\nto tell about the first few, but the \"action\" key allows you to pick\nup objects and use any powerup you got. For instance, with the fire\nflower, you can shoot fireballs, or with the ice flower fire ice pellets.\n\nOther useful keys include the Esc key, which is used to go to the menu\nor to go up a level in the menu. The menu can be navigated using the\narrow keys or the mouse.\n\nIn the worldmap, the arrow keys are used to navigate and Enter to\nenter the current level.\n\n## Community\n\nIn case you need help, feel free to reach out using the following means:\n\n* **IRC:** [#supertux](ircs://irc.libera.chat/#supertux) on\n  [Libera Chat](https://libera.chat) hosts most of the discussions between\n  developers. Also, real-time support can be provided here. If you don't know\n  how to use an IRC client, you access the channel using a web-based\n  [client](https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/irc.libera.chat:+6697/?nick=Guest?#supertux).\n  Please stay around after asking questions, otherwise you will be disconnected\n  and might miss potential answers.\n* **Matrix:** [#supertux:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#supertux:matrix.org)\n  is bridged to our IRC room.\n* **[Forum](https://forum.freegamedev.net/viewforum.php?f=66):** The SuperTux\n  community is very active on the forum, the discussion ranges from feature\n  proposals to support questions. In particular, most community-contributed\n  add-ons are published there first, so this is worth checking.\n* **Mailing Lists:** The\n  [supertux-devel](http://lists.lethargik.org/listinfo.cgi/supertux-devel-lethargik.org)\n  mailing list is dead. Here is the [archive](https://github.com/supertux-community/supertux-devel-maillist).\n* **Social Media:** Mostly on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/supertux_team) at\n  the moment.\n* **Discord:** Also, you can join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/AcvtHWz) to get in touch with us.\n\n## Development status\n\nAs of now, with the release of SuperTux 0.6.3 (December 2021), the Forest World is almost\nfinished, since the ghost forest section has been included. However, some levels, especially\nthe Ghostree Level, are considered to be placeholders, because for the next version (0.7.0) a\ngreat overhaul is planned with new features like reworked boss fights, graphics, and worlds.\nIf you have some Constructive Feedback, Contributions or ideas to share, don't hestitate\nto contact us with one of the possibilities given above.\n"

  "readme_contents": "README for bsd-games\n====================\n\nThis is the bsd-games package for Linux (and GNU Hurd), containing\nports of all the games from NetBSD-current that are free in the usual\n(DFSG/OSD) sense (i.e. modified and unmodified versions can be freely\ndistributed, including for profit).  NetBSD-current contains two other\ngames, rogue and larn.  Rogue has a standard BSD licence, but with an\nadditional contradictory licence that does not allow for-profit\ndistribution; larn has no licence at all, only a notice that \"Copying\nfor Profit is Prohibited\".  If you want rogue, get the\nbsd-games-non-free package (which should be on sunsite, but not\ntsx-11), and read the README.non-free that it contains: rogue is being\ndistributed separately, and larn not distributed at all in this Linux\nport, in the absence of definite confirmation of what licences really\napply to rogue and larn.  A game not from NetBSD, paranoia, was in\nearlier versions of bsd-games-non-free (and bsd-games 1.2 and 1.3) but\nhas been removed because of the lack of a clear licence.\n\nThe games are mostly not enhanced from the NetBSD versions, but many\nbugs are fixed.\n\nFor installation instructions and details of prerequisites, see the\nfile \"INSTALL\".\n\nThe statement of year 2000 issues associated with bsd-games and\nbsd-games-non-free is in the file \"YEAR2000\".\n\nThe copyrights and licence terms for the games, as best as I can\ndetermine them, are in \"COPYING\".\n\nThis package contains cryptographic software (caesar and rot13).  In\nsome jurisdictions, use or distribution of these utilities may be\nrestricted, whether under export control regulations or because these\ncryptosystems have been used as technical protection measures to\nrestrict access to and copying of copyright works.\n\nThis package contains the following games:\n\nadventure:\tthe original adventure by Crowther and Woods\narithmetic:\tarithmetic quiz/speed test\natc:\t\tair traffic control\nbackgammon:\tbackgammon\nbanner:\t\tdisplay a message in big letters\nbattlestar:\tadventure game on a battlestar\nbcd:\t\toutputs text in an antique form\nboggle:\t\tboggle\ncaesar:\t\treads fortunes from the game fortune, also some internet posts\ncanfield:\tcurses-based solitaire\ncountmail:\ttell you how much new mail you have\ncribbage:\tcribbage\ndab:\t\tdots and boxes\ndm:\t\tdungeon master, regulates games playing\nfactor:\t\tfactor a number\nfish:\t\tgo fish\nfortune:\tdisplays a random silly message\ngomoku:\t\tgomoku\nhack:\t\texploring the Dungeons of Doom\nhangman:\tguess the word before it is too late\nhunt:\t\thunt each other in a maze (multiplayer -- great)\nmille:\t\tmille borne against the computer\nmonop:\t\tmonopoly\nmorse:\t\toutput morse code\nnumber:\t\toutput the English text for a number\nphantasia:\tinterterminal fantasy game\npig:\t\toutput text in Pig Latin\npom:\t\tdisplay the phase of the moon\nppt:\t\toutputs text in another antique form\nprimes:\t\tgenerate primes\nquiz:\t\trandom knowledge tests\nrain:\t\tattempts to create a rain drop effect (best at 9600 baud)\nrandom:\t\trandom lines from a file or random numbers\nrobots:\t\twell... avoid the robots\nsail:\t\tsail your ship into battle\nsnake:\t\tgrab the cash and avoid the snake and exit\ntetris:\t\ttetris\ntrek:\t\tWe come in peace, shoot to kill.

Bug reports should state the\nversions of ncurses and libc used, unless clearly not relevant (e.g.,\nbugs in data files, or where you have an analysis and patch).  If you\nwant to be informed by email of new releases when they come out,\nplease let me know.\n\nKnown bugs are listed in the file BUGS; please do not send bug reports\nfor bugs listed there, but patches that fix them are welcome.\n\nFor patches, I prefer unidiffs (use \"diff -u OLD NEW\", or \"diff -ruN\nOLD-DIRECTORY NEW-DIRECTORY\"), but if your diff cannot produce them\nthen context diffs are OK.  Please remember to include details of the\nbug and your analysis of the problem if you are sending a patch; I\nhave ported the code from NetBSD to Linux, but may not be familiar\nwith the workings of any particular program, whereas you will be if\nyou have been tracing and fixing a bug.  The GCC info manual contains\na discussion of how to produce good bug reports.\n\nNotes on specific games:\n\nboggle: by default this game compiles with certain Linux improvements;\nif you want the original BSD behaviour, remove -DNEW_STYLE from the\nboggle_boggle_DEFS in boggle/boggle/Makefrag.  Defining NEW_STYLE will\nprovide a more intuitive way of quitting or playing a new game after\ntime has run out.\n\ndm: the \"dungeon master\", a program that allows you to control when\nusers can play games.  (Note that this does not control any private\ncopies of games they may have.)  I do not claim that this program is\nactually useful, but it is included in bsd-games since it is in\nNetBSD.  Add -DLOG to the DEFS in dm/Makefrag if you want logging of\ngames playing (not regularly tested).\n\nfortune: Another enhanced version is available from\n<ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/games/amusements/fortune/fortune-mod-9708.tar.gz>.\nunstr is not installed by default.  If you want to install it,\nuncomment the relevant lines (installation command and definition of\nfortune_unstr_DIRS) in fortune/unstr/Makefrag before doing the top\nlevel \"make install\".\n\nhunt: may well be unreliable or broken in various ways.  There is some\nlocal configuration possible in hunt/Makeconfig but changing this may\nwell break things.\n\nJoseph S. Myers\njsm@polyomino.org.uk\n\n\n\f\nLocal Variables:\nmode: text\nEnd:\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Rcade\n\nThe goal of `Rcade` is to provide access to games in order to waste some times in RStudio. You can play 2048, Tetris, Mario, Pacman, Spider Solitaire and others.\n\n## Installation\n\nThis package will never be released on CRAN.  \nYou can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:\n\n``` r\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github('RLesur/Rcade')\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### List available games\n\n``` r\nRcade::games\n```\n\n### Play a game\n\nThe first time you launch a game, you will be asked for installation.  \nPlaying a game is quite easy. Here are some examples:\n\n``` r\nRcade::games$`2048`\n```\n\n``` r\nRcade::games$Pacman\n```\n\n## Motivation\n\n*I always read the `Motivation` section first. Packages should always have a `Motivation` section in their `README` files.*  \n\nSo, what is the motivation behind this useless package?  \nMy first motivation was to test the RStudio viewer and I had this stupid idea to try some `HTML5` games. Why? I don't know.  \nSome folks loved the idea of playing in RStudio. So, I took some times to develop this package. That's all.\n\n## How to contribute\n\n### Try a new game \n\nThere are hundreds of `HTML5` games on [GitHub](https://github.com/). You can try a new game with the non exported `R6` constructor `Rcade:::HTML5Game`.\n\nHere's an example with the following repo: https://github.com/Zolmeister/pond\n\n``` r\nPond <- Rcade:::HTML5Game$new(name = \"pond\", \n                              github = \"Zolmeister/pond\", \n                              need_servr = FALSE, \n                              path = \"index.html\")\n```\n\nTherefore, you can try to launch the game with:\n\n``` r\nPond\n```\n\nIf you get some troubles with a game, you may try with a `HTTP` server:\n\n``` r\nPond$play(TRUE)\n```\n\n### Do a pull request\n\nGames metadata are stored in [`games.yml` file](https://github.com/RLesur/Rcade/blob/master/inst/games/games.yml) (under `inst/games` directory). You only have to add extra games to this file. Here's [an example](https://github.com/RLesur/Rcade/pull/2/files).\n\n## Credits\n\nThis package includes some non exported functions of the [`webshot` package](https://github.com/wch/webshot).  \n`webshot` package author: Winston Chang  \n`webshot` package contributors: Yihui Xie, Francois Guillem, Barret Schloerke  \nLicense: GPL-2\n\n"

The old version (1.3) still resides on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/p/rptools/svn/HEAD/tree/) but will not be updated going forward.\n\nSo what is MapTool? \n-------------------\n\nMapTool is intended for use in supporting table-top role playing games, such as D&D.\n\nIncluded are not only powerful tools for the creation of detailed maps, but also a chat function, detailed token management (allowing you to track properties of the units placed on the map and display health and status information), and an initiative tracker. Functions not being used can be hidden out of sight. These features enable your computer screen to function as a virtual table-top, fulfilling the role of battlemats and dry-erase markers and providing for infinitely scrollable maps and the ability to use a large-screen TV or video projector.  It is _game system agnostic_, meaning that while MapTool has special support for some game systems (like hexes for GURPS or square templates for D&D 4E) there is no requirement for you to use these features.\n\nThe best part is all this isn't limited to a single PC. You can utilize the integrated server function to connect to players wherever there's an Internet connection. Miss your buddy in Singapore? Not a problem. Roll up that character, and then your sleeves.\n\nAnd we don't stop there! Not content with just emulating the tabletop, we seek to improve upon the tabletop experience. This, truly, is where MapTool shines. A set of \"topology\" and vision features enable the GM to limit the view of his players, revealing the map as they explore it. Walls and other objects can prevent players from seeing what lies behind them. Darkness can be made to fall, blinding players who lack a light. Lights can be set on objects or on tokens that illuminate however much of the map you wish. If the GM wishes, s/he can limit the view of players to what their specific token sees, adding a whole new level to the experience of splitting up the party.  Woe be to the character who can't see around the corner of a wall but steps out into the view of the enemy!\n\nFor Users\n------------\nThere are several tutorials on the [MapTool wiki](https://wiki.rptools.info/index.php/Main_Page) on getting started using MapTool.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n- MapTool from version 1.9+ requires [Java 16](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK) and the RPTools builds use AdoptOpenJDK. Installers for MapTool include an embedded JRE that will install along with MapTool\n- Building MapTool requires the corresponding Java Development Kit (JDK): [How To Install JDK](doc/How_To_Install_JDK.md)\n\nVersion Numbers\n---------------\n\nOur plan to start using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) more closely from 1.6.0 and up.\n\nAll the exciting new features will be happening in the development builds.  Major bugs or security fixes will be ported between the stable and development branches so that they are available in both.\n\nResources\n---------\n\n - **Website:** http://rptools.net/ \n - **Forums:**  http://forums.rptools.net \n - **Wiki:**    https://wiki.rptools.info/index.php/Main_Page\n - **Discord:** https://discord.gg/gevEtpC\n - **Reddit:**  https://www.reddit.com/r/MapTool/\n - **Crowdin:** https://crowdin.com/project/maptool\n\nConfiguration Steps Prior to Building MapTool\n---------------------------------------------\n\nSee [the Contributor Setup page](https://github.com/RPTools/maptool/wiki/Contributor-Setup-Instructions-For-MapTool) for instructions on building MapTool and contributing to the project.\n\n\nRecommended IDE\n----------------\nWe currently recommend [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) as our editor of choice although Eclipse and other IDE's should work just fine as well. For IntelliJ IDEA, simply open the project folder and it will detect it as a Gradle project and you should be ready to go with minimal effort.\n\n\nCode Commits and Pull Requests\n--------------------------------\nWe follow GitFlow process for the most part so please work all issues off of our `develop` branch. If you code changes are substantial, me may repoint the pull request to it's own feature branch for testing and further development.\n\nWe prefer all pull requests to be preceded and reference an Issue before we accept and merge. If there is not currently an open issue, please create one and leave a comment if you plan to work on the issue. When you commit your code, please reference the issue, e.g. `fixes #1234` in addition to any other comments.\n\n\nOptional\n--------\n\n- [How To Setup User Interface (UI) Tools for MapTool](doc/How_To_Setup_UI_Tools.md)\n"

  "language": "Java",
  "readme_contents": "\u26a0\ufe0f This is deprecated. Please use [Games Services](https://github.com/Abedalkareem/games_services) instead.\n\n# play_games\n\nUse Google Play Games Services on your Flutter app; this allows for signin and achievements so far, but more additions are very welcome. If you like it, give us a star and feel free to help and contribute.\n\nThis is android only for now but iOS is gracefully handled so you can define what happens.\n\n## Part 1: Sign In\n\nCall the sign in method to sign in; you must check if the login was successufully.\n\n```dart\n    SigninResult result = await PlayGames.signIn();\n    if (result.success) {\n        await PlayGames.setPopupOptions();\n        this.account = result.account;\n    } else {\n        this.error = result.message;\n    }\n    this.loading = false;\n```\n\nBut don't think it will be that easy! Actually, GPGS signin is quite a hassle to do, but [this](doc/signin.md) tutorial should help you out with this nefarious task.\n\nReasons for failure will be specified in the error property. Otherwhise, you can access the account property to get the account.\n\n## Part 2: Achievements\n\nYou can both award achievements (unlock/increment) and show the Achievements screen in your game.\n\nIn order to unlock or increment an achievement, use the provided APIs:\n\n```dart\n  PlayGames.unlockAchievementByName(name);\n```\n\nThis is async and you wait for the return if desired. The name is the name in your `games-ids.xml` file, you can also call the by id method.\n\nAlso, there is a method to display a popup with your achievements:\n\n```dart\n    PlayGames.showAchievements();\n```\n\nAgain, this is async and returns only when the player closes the popup. So maybe you want to pause your game until that happens.\n\n## Part 3: Saved Games\n\nFirstly, you must enable Saved Games. Go to your Google Play Console > Game Services > Select your game > Game details and toggle Saved Games option on. Then Save and publish. Beware, this cannot be later turned off.\n\n![Example of Saved Games](doc/saves/p1.png \"Example of Saved Games\")\n\nSecondly, in order to use the Saved Games feature, you must required explicit permission upon logging in. Thankfully, the `signIn` method can be configured to ask for that permission via the `scopeSnapshot` option, like so:\n\n```dart\n    SigninResult result = await PlayGames.signIn(scopeSnapshot: true); // allow to load/save games later\n```\n\nBy default that option is false, so be sure to check it in. In Saved Games, a `snapshot` is of one save slot, that is, one representation of the game state that can be reloaded later. It is comprised of `content`, a blob, and `metadata`, a structured key-value pairs set.\n\nYou can use the methods `openSnapshot` and `saveSnaphost` to load and save game data under a given `snapshotName`. If your game has several slots, use several differente names for then. Otherwise, use only a single `snapshotName` for everything. A few points to ponder:\n\n * You put your save data in the `content` field, which is a String. You can put anything there (json, custom format, etc).\n * Metadata are also retrieved but for now only the description can be set. These metadata are useful if you are using the default save game screen provided (not support by this lib). Otherwise you can get some information from it.\n * Whenever you save a snapshot, if you intend to save again, you must reopen. You can either keep it open util the player saves the game, then save and reopen, or keep it closed, when the player saves, you open and save. Whenever you save, it is closed.\n\nHere follows an example of the usage of the APIs from the [crystap](https://github.com/luanpotter/crystap) sample open-source game used to showcase this plugin:\n\n```dart\n    Future<int> fetchStartAmount() async {\n        Snapshot save = await PlayGames.openSnapshot('crystap.main'); // load the existing save or create a new empty one if none exists\n        if (save.content == null || save.content.trim().isEmpty) {\n            return 0; // default value when there is no save\n        }\n        return int.parse(save.content);\n    }\n\n    Future<bool> saveAmount(int amount) async {\n        bool result = await PlayGames.saveSnapshot('crystap.main', amount.toString()); // save the current state to the snapshot\n        await PlayGames.openSnapshot('crystap.main'); // reopen snapshot after save\n        return result;\n    }\n```\n\nHere our data is just a single integer, that we convert to a String in order to save it within the content. Again, your save can be an arbitrarily complex JSON or anything like that. See the full Crystap game for more in-depth details on how to use the API.\n\nThere are also APIs for conflict resolution. If you want more robuts integration, check those out in the source code.\n\n## Part 4: Leaderboards\n\nTo use Leaderboards, you must create one in the GPGS console. Also, you can regenerate your games-ids files to be able to use the leaderboard name instead of id.\n\nOnce that's done, you can use the following APIs that are available:\n\n```dart\n  static Future<SubmitScoreResults> submitScoreByName(String leaderboardName, int score) async;\n  static Future<SubmitScoreResults> submitScoreById(String leaderboardId, int score) async;\n  static Future<ScoreResults> loadPlayerCenteredScoresByName(String leaderboardName, TimeSpan timeSpan, CollectionType collectionType, int maxResults, { bool forceReload = false }) async;\n  static Future<ScoreResults> loadPlayerCenteredScoresById(String leaderboardId, TimeSpan timeSpan, CollectionType collectionType, int maxResults, { bool forceReload = false }) async;\n  static Future<bool> showLeaderboard(String leaderboardId) async;\n```\n\nThese methods are pretty thin wrappers over the Java/Android APIs, so you can check details about that the official docs. Also, checkout the crystap game for more details on how to implement this feature (better docs are on the way!).\n"

The webpage lets them use their phone as a controller.\nThis lets you make games that support more than the typical 4 players.\n\n<img id=\"test\" src=\"http://docs.happyfuntimes.net/images/scene-01-powpow.jpg\" width=\"782\" height=\"441\" />\n\nI suppose theoretically there's no limit to the number of players.\n\n<img id=\"test\" src=\"http://docs.happyfuntimes.net/images/400-player-bombbomb.jpg\" width=\"782\" height=\"441\" />\n\nIt also lets you make games with unique controllers.\n\n<img id=\"test\" src=\"http://docs.happyfuntimes.net/images/scene-02-jamjam.jpg\" width=\"782\" height=\"441\" />\n\nThere's a Unity3D library if you'd like to make the game in Unity3D.\n\n<img id=\"test\" src=\"http://docs.happyfuntimes.net/images/scene-03-unity.jpg\" width=\"782\" height=\"441\" />\n\n*   The smartphones end up just being smart controllers.\n\n    As there is just one machine running the *real* game this means\n    they are relatively easy to create. No crazy networking, state syncing,\n    or dead reckoning required.\n\n*   JavaScript libraries for the browser and Unity3D libraries are provided\n\n    This makes it easy to bang out a game. Use any JavaScript framework or Unity3D.\n\n*   For controllers the sky is the limit.\n\n    *   Have a one button game. The user touches their screen.\n\n    *   Make virtual DPads\n\n    *   Make virutal paddle controllers (think Pong)\n\n    *   Have users choose answers to question like Jeopardy\n\n    *   Access the camera, send selfies to the game.\n\n    *   Emit sound effects from the phone\n\n    *   Use the device orientation API and rotate something in game to match\n\n    *   Make a rhythm band where each device becomes an instrument.\n\n    *   Make a rhythm game like Parappa but each person is a different color\n        so that they each have to play their part at the right time\n\n    *   Let the user draw something on their phone. Insert that drawing into the game.\n\n    *   Show diagrams. Let the user plan out football plays.\n\n    *   Controllers can change dynamically.\n\n        Have 2 dpads for the dual stick part of your game. Have a single\n        button for the speed contest. Change to a 3 letter box to let a player\n        enter their high score initials.\n\n*   The API is simple to use (for some defintion of *simple* :D).\n\n    Games create a `GameServer` object\n\n       var server = new GameServer();\n\n    From that point on anytime a player connects the GameServer will emit an event\n    `playerconnect`\n\n       server.addEventListener('playerconnect', createNewPlayer);\n\n    It's up to you what to do when a new player connects. For example if you had a `Player`\n    object you might do something like this\n\n       var players = [];\n\n       Player = function(netPlayer) {\n         this.netPlayer = netPlayer;  // remember this Player's NetPlayer\n       };\n\n       // make a new Player anytime the 'playerconnect' event is emitted\n       function createNewPlayer(netPlayer) {\n         players.push(new Player(netPlayer));\n       }\n\n    If the player disconnects or quits the `NetPlayer` will emit a `disconnect` event.\n    If we want to handle that we might do something like\n\n        Player = function(netPlayer) {\n          this.netPlayer = netPlayer;  // remember this Player's NetPlayer\n\n          netPlayer.addEventListener('disconnect', Player.prototype.remove.bind(this));\n        };\n\n        Player.prototype.remove = function() {\n          players.splice(players.indexOf(this), 1);  // remove ourselves from our array of players.\n        };\n\n    We can send events to the player's phone by calling `netPlayer.sendCmd` For example\n\n        Player.prototype.score = function(points) {\n          this.netPlayer.sendCmd('score', {points: points});\n        };\n\n    That will cause an event `score` to be emitted on the player's phone. The player's phone\n    has a correspondiing `sendCmd` function. When called an event will be emitted on that\n    player's `NetPlayer` object.  Add listeners for any events you make up\n\n        Player = function(netPlayer) {\n          this.netPlayer = netPlayer;  // remember this Player's NetPlayer\n\n          netPlayer.addEventListener('disconnect', Player.prototype.remove.bind(this));\n          netPlayer.addEventListener('moveleft', Player.prototype.moveleft.bind(this));\n          netPlayer.addEventListener('moveright', Player.prototype.moveright.bind(this));\n          netPlayer.addEventListener('jump', Player.prototype.jump.bind(this));\n        };\n\n    Whatever data you pass to `sendCmd` will arrive with the event.\n\n        ...\n        this.netPlayer.sendCmd('die', {\n          reason: \"So and so killed you\",\n          pointsToLose: 100,\n        });\n\n    On the phone we create a `GameClient`\n\n        var client = new GameClient();\n\n    Just like `NetPlayer` above we can listen for events.\n\n        client.addEventListener('die', handleDie);\n\n        function handleDie(data) {\n          console.log(\"you lost\", data.pointsToLose, \"points. Reason:\", data.reason);\n        }\n\n    Similarly you can send events to the game\n\n        window.addEventListener('pointerdown', function(e) {\n           client.sendCmd('jump', { power: e.mouseY });\n        });\n\n    It's up to you to decide which events to send and receive for your particular\n    game's needs.\n\n*   There is also a synchronized clock across machines.\n\n    Use it as follows.\n\n        var online = true;\n        var clock = SyncedClock.createClock(online);\n\n        ...\n\n        var timeInSeconds = clock.getTime();\n\n    If online is false when the clock is created it will create a clock\n    that returns the local time.\n\n## Limitations\n\nThe number of players that can connect to a game is limited by your networking\nequipment. With enough access points there's no limit to the number of player\nthat could connect that I know of but of course 1000s of players would require\nlots of access points and lots of bandwidth and a game design that lets 1000s of people\nactually participate.\n\nAnother limit in the default mode is players must be on the same network behind\na NAT. This is standard for most if not all home routers. It's probably less standard in\noffice setups. In this mode you start HappyFunTimes, tell your users to connect to\nyour WiFi and then have them go to `happyfuntimes.net`.\n\nHappyFunTimes has the option to run it's own DNS which is another option but\nrequires configuring your router. This option is probably more suited to\nevents, installations, and things like that. In this mode, players connect\nto the WiFi specificaly setup to run HappyFunTimes. iOS devices will automatically\nfind HappyFunTimes once connected to the WiFi, no other interaction required by the user.\nAndroid devices require the user to first connect to the WiFi and then go to any random\nurl like `hft.com` or `h.com`.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n*   How secure is this?\n\n    Not at all. This is not a library for the internet. It's a library for\n    running a game at a party, meeting, bar, etc...\n\n    That said if there's anything easy and performant you'd like to suggest\n    submit a pull request.\n\n*   What about cheating?\n\n    Again, this is meant for games where everyone is in the same room watching\n    the same display. If someone is off in the corner trying to hack the game\n    through the net maybe you shouldn't have invited them to your party.\n\n    That said if there's anything easy and performant you'd like to suggest\n    submit a pull request.\n\n*   Does it work on Windows, OSX, and Linux?\n\n    The controllers of course run in any modern browser. Games run in\n    whatever environment you've created them for. Most of the samples here\n    are HTML and so should run in any modern browser on any platform.\n\n    As for happyFunTimes I've run it on OSX, Linux and Windows with\n    no problems.\n\n*   Why not WebRTC?\n\n    WebRTC would possibly allow the phones to talk directly the game rather than through\n    the happyfuntimes. happyfuntimes would need to setup a rendevous between the 2 machines\n    but after that the conncetion should be peer to peer.... Or so I'm lead to believe.\n    WebRTC still doesn't currently exist in iOS Safari as of iOS8. It does exist in Chrome.\n\n    Feel free to submit a pull request ;-)\n\nTo Do\n-----\n\n[There's lots of ideas](todo.md).\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Unity Porting Code Samples\n\n## Read the Whitepapers\n\nThis repo has been created as reference code samples for a set of whitepapers produced to help developers in \nporting their Unity games to Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.\n\nIt is recommended that you read these whitepapers before delving into the code.\n\n- [Getting Started on Windows Store with Unity](http://aka.ms/unityWinStoreStart)\n- [Porting tips for Windows Store with Unity](http://aka.ms/unityWinStoreTips)\n- [Getting Started on Windows Phone with Unity](http://aka.ms/unitywpstart)\n- [Porting tips for Windows Phone with Unity](http://aka.ms/unityWPTips)\n\n\nThe prerequisites for working with these samples are in either of the Getting Started documents above. \n\n## What's in the repo?\n\nSmall demonstrations and code snippets for most of the approaches outlined in the papers.  \n\nThis repo contains the following folders:\n\n-  **Platformer** - Unity 4.3.1 2D game freely available on the Unity Store. We use it as a base to add concepts. \n-  **PlatformerApps** - Vs.net 2013 solution folder with Windows Store and Windows Phone Apps \n-  **PlatformerApps** - Vs.net 2013 solution folder with Plugin example, including legacy fixes for Win 8/WP8\n-  **Resources** -  Packages to highlight current shader issues on Windows\n\n\nThere are currently the following tasks in the game for both Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8\n\n- **Graceful loading** is an extended splash and progress bar\n- **Sharing** support using sample plugin\n- **Live tile** updates with latest score\n- **Dynamic App Version** the app version is displayed from the windows app package dynamically using a plugin\n- **Complete Plugin Development Sample** with shared code across both Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8\n\nFor Windows 8.1, there are a couple of extra snippets \n\n- **WACK fixers** has working implementations of missing classes in .NET Core. Currently, it has Collections, IO, Sockets, Threading, and other useful class extensions. There is more coming soon. \n- **Facebook Integration** (Login, Logout, Friend Request) (WP8 has known issues, see below)\n\n- **Window Resizing sample**, pause/resume at 500px (Windows 8.1 only)\n\n- **Orientation Change Support** Via the sample plugin, Unity can respond to orientation changes\n- **Xaml Textbox Overlay** Via the sample plugin, Unity can show a XAML textbox as an overlay to get keyboard input from soft (aka touch) keyboard.  \n\n\n## Building the solution ##\n\nThe first time you build, you need to follow specific order:\n\n1. Build to Windows Store and then Windows Phone in Unity 4.3.1 (over top of projects in the Windows solution folder)\n2. Build the Windows Solution (which will automatically add Nuget dependencies)\n3. Run the Windows Store or Windows Phone App!\n\nSee below for tips on each step:  \n\n## Building the Windows Store Player from Unity \n\n- File > Build Settings > Windows Store. \n- Select Xaml/C# and 8.1\n- Build out to PlatformerApps\\PlatformerWindowsStore folder\n\nNote: If you make changes to Unity scripts and game, you can just keep building to PlatformerWindowsStore project and it won't override your Visual studio project. \nIf you  add new plugins or change the player preferences, you will need to merge these manually.    \n\n## Building Windows Phone App from Unity\n\n- File > Build Settings > Windows Phone\n- Select Xaml/C# \n- Build out on top of \\PlatformerApps\\PlatformerWindowsPhone folder\n\nNote: If you make changes to Unity scripts and game, you can just keep building to PlatformerWindowsPhone project and it won't override your Visual studio project. \nIf you  add new plugins or change the player preferences, you will need to merge these manually.  \n\n## Building and running for Windows Store\n\n- Open \\UnityPorting\\PlatformerApps\\Platformer.sln with Visual Studio 2013. \n- You must have the [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/) packet manager installed.<br/>\n- First Time: Build the solution to ensure all NuGet packages are available (e.g. Facebook) as the solution is set to automatically restore NuGet packages.\n- Ensure PlatfomerWindows is set as the startup project\n- Ensure that configuration for the build matches your target device (e.g. Master | x86)\n- Then simply F5 the solution and it will run!\n\n## Building and running for Windows Phone\n\n- Open \\UnityPorting\\PlatformerApps\\Platformer.sln with Visual Studio 2013. \n- You must have the [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/) packet manager installed.<br/>\n- First Time: Build the solution to ensure all NuGet packages are available (e.g. Facebook) as the solution is set to automatically restore NuGet packages.\n- Ensure PlatfomerWP8 is set as the startup project\n- Ensure that configuration for the build matches your target device (e.g. Master | Arm)\n- Then simply F5 the solution and it should run!\n\n## Updating the Sample Plugin\n\nThe plugin binary outputs are included in the Unity project automatically, but you can update and easily have Unity get the updated plugins.\n\nTo build the plugin, open the \\UnityPorting\\PlatformerPlugin\\PlatformerPlugin.sln with Visual Studio 2013 \nand set the build configuration for \"Release\" and \"Any CPU\", there is a post build event that will automatically copy the resulting MyPlugin.dll (and any adjacent dlls in the target directory) to the correct locations in the Unity project automatically as follows:\n\n- MyPluginUnity Project > /Assets/Plugins/MyPlugin.dll \n- MyPluginWindows Project > /Assets/Plugins/Metro/MyPlugin.dll\n- MyPluginWP8 Project > /Assets/Plugins/WP8/MyPlugin.dll\n\nNote: If you make changes to the plugins later, every time you update the plugin, you should rebuild in Unity and Visual Studio. \nMake sure in Visual Studio when rebuilding the plugins, to set the build to 'Release' and 'Any CPU'.\n\n## Upcoming features  ##\nWe are just getting started. Currently, it is a sample and lots of useful snippets you can copy and paste into your projects.  \nWe need  to: \n- Create guidance papers on getting ready for certification, performance and troubleshooting.  \n\n## Known issues ##\n\nFacebook plugin issue on Windows Phone 8 - \nThe web page that appears after selecting a friend to invite has intermittent issues, sometimes the cancel/send invite buttons don't appear. \nThe buttons when they do appear never work though. This is a WP8 specific issue.\n"

If you're not\nusing DOS as your operating system then [DOSbox](http://www.dosbox.com/) can be\nused to emulate a DOS computer.\n\nWhen you run `love.exe` it will expect its first argument to be your game's\ndirectory. The file `main.lua` will then be searched for and executed. If, for\nexample, your project was in a directory named `mygame` you would run the\nfollowing:\n```batch\nlove mygame\n```\n\nA small example program which displays white text on a black background and\nexits when the `escape` key is pressed is as follows:\n\n```lua\nfunction love.draw()\n  love.graphics.print('Hello World!', 20, 20)\nend\n\nfunction love.keypressed(key)\n  if key == \"escape\" then\n    love.event.quit()\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThe [doc/api.md](doc/api.md) file provides a reference and overview of all of\nthe built-in LoveDOS modules, functions and callbacks.\n\nThe [doc/packaging.md](doc/packaging.md) file provides instructions for\npackaging your game for distribution.\n\n\n## Building\nInstructions for building the project from source can be found in the\n[doc/building.md](doc/building.md) file.\n\n\n## License\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\nthe terms of the MIT license.

These libraries have both been tested with jsGameSoup on Internet Explorer 6 and work fine, with the FlashCanvas library providing better performance than excanvas. You should get the source code for the project you want and then put the respective line for loading the library inside the `<head>` tag, before any other `<script>` tags.\n\nTo use ExplorerCanvas:\n\n\t<!--[if IE]><script src=\"explorercanvas/excanvas.js\"></script><![endif]-->\n\nTo use FlashCanvas:\n\n\t<!--[if IE]><script src=\"flashcanvas/bin/flashcanvas.js\"></script><![endif]-->\n\nSee the Download section above for links to these libraries.\n\nOne final gotcha under IE6 is that Javascript datastructures should not contain a trailing comma on the last element. E.g. `t = [1, 2, 3];` not `t = [1, 2, 3,];` This is a quirk of the browser that seems to trip people up. If you are finding debugging under old versions of Internet Explorer frustrating, one thing you can do to help is [install the Microsoft Script Debugger](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=22185). You'll also want to enable debugging in the advanced options of the browser.\n\n### Performance tips ###\n\n * Generally the larger screen area your game fills the slower it will draw. Try using window.open to launch your game in it's own window of fixed size.\n\n * If you have an operation drawing lots of repeating shapes on Canvas, do them inside one big c.beginPath() and c.closePath() instead of lots of little ones.\n\n### Auto-launching your games ###\n\nAuto-launching is useful if you have pages with multiple game canvases and you don't want to write the launch code for every instance. You do this by simply creating `<canvas>` tags in your html document with an attribute \"jsgs\":\n\n\t<html>\n\t\t<head>\n\t\t\t<script src='jsGameSoup/jsgamesoup.js'></script>\n\t\t\t<script>\n\t\t\t\tfunction startGame(gs) {\n\t\t\t\t\t// our demo game entity\n\t\t\t\t\tfunction Thingy() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.draw = function(c, gs) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tc.moveTo(10, 10);\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tc.lineTo(10 + 10 * Math.sin(), 10 + 10 * Math.cos());\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\tgs.addEntity(new Thingy());\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t</script>\n\t\t</head>\n\t\t<body>\n\t\t\t<canvas id='mygame' jsgs='startGame' fps=\"25\"></canvas>\n\t\t</body>\n\t</html>\n\nWhen the page is loaded, jsGameSoup will attach a `new JSGameSoup()` object to every canvas tag with the 'jsgs' attribute. This specifies the name of the function which should be called to launch the game script associated with that canvas. The 'fps' attribute specifies the desired frame rate of the game engine for that canvas. Once the jsGameSoup engine has been attached to the canvas it starts running immediately.\n\n"

Also aiming to be an easier alternative to newbie coders.\n\n## Installation:\nYou must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/), seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it misses some stuff.\n\nFollow a Friday Night Funkin' source code compilation tutorial, after this you will need to install LuaJIT.\n\nTo install LuaJIT do this: `haxelib install linc_luajit` on a Command prompt/PowerShell\n\n...Or if you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts, delete the \"LUA_ALLOWED\" line on Project.xml\n\n## Credits:\n* Shadow Mario - Coding\n* RiverOaken - Arts and Animations\n* bbpanzu - Assistant Coding\n\n### Special Thanks\n* shubs - New Input System\n* SqirraRNG - Chart Editor's Sound Waveform base code\n* iFlicky - Delay/Combo Menu Song Composer + Dialogue Sounds\n* PolybiusProxy - .MP4 Loader Extension\n* Keoiki - Note Splash Animations\n_____________________________________\n\n# Features\n\n## Attractive animated dialogue boxes:\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44785097/127706669-71cd5cdb-5c2a-4ecc-871b-98a276ae8070.gif)\n\n\n## Mod Support\n* Probably one of the main points of this engine, you can code in .lua files outside of the source code, making your own weeks without even messing with the source!\n* Comes with a Mod Organizing/Disabling Menu. \n\n\n## Atleast one change to every week:\n### Week 1:\n  * New Dad Left sing sprite \n  * Unused stage lights are now used\n### Week 2:\n  * Both BF and Skid & Pump does \"Hey!\" animations\n  * Thunders does a quick light flash and zooms the camera in slightly\n  * Added a quick transition/cutscene to Monster\n### Week 3:\n  * BF does \"Hey!\" during Philly Nice\n  * Blammed has a cool new colors flash during that sick part of the song\n### Week 4:\n  * Better hair physics for Mom/Boyfriend (Maybe even slightly better than Week 7's :eyes:)\n  * Henchmen die during all songs. Yeah :(\n### Week 5:\n  * Bottom Boppers and GF does \"Hey!\" animations during Cocoa and Eggnog\n  * On Winter Horrorland, GF bops her head slower in some parts of the song.\n### Week 6:\n  * On Thorns, the HUD is hidden during the cutscene\n  * Also there's the Background girls being spooky during the \"Hey!\" parts of the Instrumental\n\n## Cool new Chart Editor changes and countless bug fixes\n![](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine/blob/main/docs/img/chart.png?raw=true)\n* You can now chart \"Event\" notes, which are bookmarks that trigger specific actions that usually were hardcoded on the vanilla version of the game.\n* Your song's BPM can now have decimal values\n* You can manually adjust a Note's strum time if you're really going for milisecond precision\n* You can change a note's type on the Editor, it comes with two example types:\n  * Alt Animation: Forces an alt animation to play, useful for songs like Ugh/Stress\n  * Hey: Forces a \"Hey\" animation instead of the base Sing animation, if Boyfriend hits this note, Girlfriend will do a \"Hey!\" too.\n\n## Multiple editors to assist you in making your own Mod\n![Screenshot_3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44785097/144629914-1fe55999-2f18-4cc1-bc70-afe616d74ae5.png)\n* Working both for Source code modding and Downloaded builds!\n\n## Story mode menu rework:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UB2EKpV.png)\n* Added a different BG to every song (less Tutorial)\n* All menu characters are now in individual spritesheets, makes modding it easier.\n\n## Credits menu\n![Screenshot_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44785097/144632635-f263fb22-b879-4d6b-96d6-865e9562b907.png)\n* You can add a head icon, name, description and a Redirect link for when the player presses Enter while the item is currently selected.\n\n## Awards/Achievements\n* The engine comes with 16 example achievements that you can mess with and learn how it works (Check Achievements.hx and search for \"checkForAchievement\" on PlayState.hx)\n\n## Options menu:\n* You can change Note colors, Delay and Combo Offset, Controls and Preferences there.\n * On Preferences you can toggle Downscroll, Middlescroll, Anti-Aliasing, Framerate, Low Quality, Note Splashes, Flashing Lights, etc.\n\n## Other gameplay features:\n* When the enemy hits a note, their strum note also glows.\n* Lag doesn't impact the camera movement and player icon scaling anymore.\n* Some stuff based on Week 7's changes has been put in (Background colors on Freeplay, Note splashes)\n* You can reset your Score on Freeplay/Story Mode by pressing Reset button.\n* You can listen to a song or adjust Scroll Speed/Damage taken/etc. on Freeplay by pressing Space.\n"

You can block particular notifications with `ignore` parameter |\n| /webhook info       |                      | Retrieve details about configured webhooks in the guild.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| /webhook edit set   | Manage Webhooks      | Add/edit `role` to mention, `keywords` or `ignore` to previously configured webhook.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| /webhook edit clear | Manage Webhooks      | Remove `role` to mention, `keywords`, or `ignore` of previously configured webhook.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| /webhook delete     | Manage Webhooks      | Delete previously configured webhook.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| /statistics         |                      | Send basic bot statistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| /ping               |                      | Pong! \ud83c\udfd3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| /latest             |                      | Send latest found game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n\n## How to set up the bot\n\n1.

  "readme_contents": "CES.js\n==============\n\nCES.js is a lightweight Component-Entity-System framework for JavaScript games.\n\n\nBasic Usage\n-----------\n\n\nTo define a new component, simply extend `CES.Component`. \nNote that each component should have a unique `name` property.\n\n```js\nvar Position = CES.Component.extend({\n    name: 'position',\n    init: function (x, y) {\n        this.x = x;\n        this.y = y;\n    }\n});\n\nvar Velocity = CES.Component.extend({\n    name: 'velocity',\n    init: function (x, y) {\n        this.x = x;\n        this.y = y;\n    }\n});\n\nvar Health = CES.Component.extend({\n    name: 'health',\n    init: function (maxHealth) {\n        this.health = this.maxHealth = maxHealth;\n    },\n    isDead: function () {\n        return this.health <= 0;\n    },\n    receiveDamage: function (damage) {\n        this.health -= damage;\n    }\n});\n```\n\nAn entity is essentially a container of one or more components.\n\n```js\nvar hero = new CES.Entity();\nhero.addComponent(new Position(0, 0));\nhero.addComponent(new Velocity(0, 0));\nhero.addComponent(new Health(100));\n```\n\nThe system is responsible for updating the entities.\nIn a real game there may be a lot of systems, like `CollisionSystem`,\n`RenderSystem`, `ControlSystem` etc.\n\n```js\nvar PhysicSystem = CES.System.extend({\n    update: function (dt) {\n        var entities, position, velocity;\n\n        entities = this.world.getEntities('position', 'velocity');\n\n        entities.forEach(function (entity) {\n            position = entity.getComponent('position');\n            velocity = entity.getComponent('velocity');\n            position.x += velocity.x * dt;\n            position.y += velocity.y * dt;\n        });\n    }\n});\n```\n\nThe world is the container of all the entities and systems.\nCalling the `update` method will *sequentially* update all the systems,\nin the order they were added.\n\n```js\nvar world = new CES.World();\n\nworld.addEntity(hero);\n// ... add other entities\n\nworld.addSystem(new PhysicSystem());\n// ... add other systems\n\nrequestAnimationFrame(function () {\n    world.update(/* interval */);\n})\n```\n\nA system is notified when it is added or removed from the world:\n\n```js\nvar MySystem = CES.System.extend({\n  addedToWorld: function(world)  {\n    // Code to handle being added to world. Remeber to call this._super.\n    this._super(world);\n  },\n  removedFromWorld: function(world) {\n    // Code to handle being removed from world.\n    this._super(world);\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThe world emits signals when entities are added or removed. You can listen for\nspecific entities and handle the signal accordingly:\n\n```js\nvar MySystem = CES.System.extend({\n  addedToWorld: function(world) {\n    world.entityAdded('position', 'velocity').add(function(entity) {\n      // This function is called whenever an entity with both 'position' and\n      // 'velocity' components is added to the world. It can also be called when\n      // a component is added to an entity; for example, when an entity with\n      // only 'position' has 'velocity' added to it.\n    });\n    world.entityRemoved('position', 'velocity').add(function(entity) {\n      // This function is called whenever an entity with both 'position' and\n      // 'velocity' components is removed from the world. It can also be called \n      // when a component is removed from an entity; for example, when an entity\n      // with both 'position' and 'velocity' has 'velocity' removed from it.\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\n\nInstallation (Browser)\n-------\n\nDownload the [minified js file](http://github.com/qiao/ces.js/raw/master/dist/ces-browser.min.js) and include it in your web page.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"./ces-browser.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nInstallation (Node.js)\n------\n\nIf you want to use it in Node.js, you may install it via `npm`.\n\n```bash\nnpm install ces\n```\n\nThen, in your program:\n\n```javascript\nvar CES = require('ces');\n```\n\n\nDevelopment\n------------\n\nLayout:\n\n    .\n    |-- dist         # browser distribution\n    |-- src          # source code\n    `-- test         # test scripts\n\nYou will need to install `node.js` and use `npm` to install the dependencies: \n\n    npm install -d \n\nTo build the browser distribution \n(It will use [node-browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to generate a browser distribution,\nand use [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) to compress):\n\n    make\n\nTo run the tests with\n[mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) and [should.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js) \n\n    make test\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n[MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\n\nCopyright 2013 Xueqiao Xu &lt;xueqiaoxu@gmail.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

  "readme_contents": "# BUILD AND RUN   \nSee **oxygine-framework/readme/** folder. It has instructions on how to build and run oxygine on different platforms.\n\n# Wiki available at\nhttps://github.com/oxygine/oxygine-framework/wiki\n\n\n# Oxygine is a C++ engine for 2D mobile games. \nYet another shell around OpenGL/D3D API you would say? No, this is a set of classes and tools to create a game according to your requirements.\n\nAt the basis of the engine there is a scene graph, that is similar to Flash. In short, You can call this as Flash for C++, but more comfortable and way faster. Initially it was developed for mobile platforms (iOS, Android), but can also be used for PC games.\n\nSource code is available under MIT license (use for free anywhere).\n\n## SDK includes:\n- Source code, libraries\n- Necessary tools, documentation\n- Examples\n- Demo for testing and demonstration of base features\n\n## Supported platforms:\n- Android\n- iOS\n- Windows\n- MacOSX\n- Emscripten (web)\n\n## Examples of code:\n\n```cpp\n//create sprite and display it\nspSprite sprite = new Sprite();\nsprite->attachTo(getStage());\n\n//run animation tween\nsprite->addTween(Sprite::TweenAnim(gameResources.getResAnim(\"anim2\")), duration, loops);\n\n//run position tween\nsprite->addTween(Sprite::TweenPosition(x, y), duration, loops);\n\n//handle click event\nsprite->addEventListener(TouchEvent::CLICK, [sprite](Event*){\n    \n    log::messageln(\"clicked to sprite!\");\n    //change sprite color\n    sprite->setColor(Color::Gray);\n});\n```\t\t     \n\n## Features:\n- Programming language is C++.\n- For rendering OpenGL(ES) 2.0 is used. Custom shaders supported.\n- Compressed textures supported.\n- Component based system, simple and predictable OOP API. Possibility to inherit from classes and overload their behavior.\n- No global mega managers of everything, that dictate the requirements and the way you write your code.\n- Effective and flexible work with resources, very close to your game.\n- Components of the engine have weak links between each other. Can be used together, separately or not at all.\n- Fast creation and deletion of objects using memory pools for all engine objects.\n- SceneGraph is somewhat similar to Flash ([diagrams with inheritance models](http://i.imgur.com/DO5WFUA.png)). It is built on smart pointers (analogue boost:intrusive_ptr). No need to hassle with memory control, memory leaks. \n- Debug Tools ([screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/77aGg82.gif)). Tree Inspector is \u201cVisual profiler\u201d for Scene Graph. Right in the game you can view the graph and different branches to analyze and errors search. \u201cTextures Inspector\u201d shows you currently loaded textures into memory ([screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/Znynji4.png))\n- Render to texture.\n- Resources description is stored in xml file. It has multiple different parameters: you can add your own resources types, format can be set, in which you will store the texture(atlas) in memory, number of columns and rows for animation, etc. Any resource can have user-data attributes.\n- Tweens for frame-by-frame animation, color, position, rotation, etc. Easily create your own.\n- A set of basic UI components commonly used in games: Button, Sprite, ProgressBar and others ([image](http://i.imgur.com/IUxKi7O.png))\nCommand-line tool on Python to process your resources: Build you resources from XML files into atlases, determining the optimal size of atlases. Resize assets from high-res to necessary for your game. Does additional work to optimize work with resources in the game. Compress automatically to ETC1 or PVRTC textures format.\n- Well-designed handling of events from mouse and multi-touch (for example you can press two buttons with two fingers at the same time without collisions) based on AS3 Flash model.\n- It is possible to write code and dialogs in blocking style (concurency programming/coroutines).\n- Accurate rendering of text with line-wraps, vertical and horizontal alignment support, localization, utf-8. Base HTML tags support ([screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/x66UTR3.gif)).\n- If you want to add multiple sets of assets for different game resolutions it can be done on the engine level by writing just a few lines of code. You won\u2019t need to adjust coordinates manually for different resolution. It is enough just to keep initial art in high-res.\n- Masking ([screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/dxSUVGX.gif), [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/wAhd6BG.png))\n- Atlas assembling on the fly during the loading, if you didn't provide it yourself.\n- Multi-threaded resources loading.\n- It is possible to partially unload \u201cheavy\u201d resources like atlases from memory. The resouce handle to work with atlas will be still valid (as well as its size) and will even have texture points, but the texture itself will be empty. This is very important when you have strict memory limitations: for example if you created the whole UI with all resources loaded, but there is no need to display them all at once.\n- Fast automatic batching.\n- Bitmap fonts based on [BMFont](http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/) and FreeType. Possibility to add your own font type.\n\nYou could build it on top of Marmalade, SDL2 or adapt it for your platform. Oxygine can be built with Emscripten for internet browsers as well.\n\nAnd this is not everything. There are a lot of easy-to-use features, this framework is not a monster and is clear and intuitive. Viewing a couple of examples is enough to understand how it works.\n\n\n## Contacts\nYou can find more information at [oxygine.org](http://oxygine.org)\n"

Install via Package Manager</summary>\n<br />\n  \n  The package is available on the [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/packages/com.chebanovdd.match3sdk/).\n\n  - Open `Edit/Project Settings/Package Manager`\n  - Add a new `Scoped Registry` (or edit the existing OpenUPM entry)\n\n    ```\n    Name      package.openupm.com\n    URL       https://package.openupm.com\n    Scope(s)  com.cysharp.unitask\n              com.chebanovdd.match3sdk\n    ```\n  - Open `Window/Package Manager`\n  - Select `My Registries`\n  - Install `UniTask` and `Match3-SDK` packages\n  \n</details>\n\n<details><summary>2. Install via Git URL</summary>\n<br />\n  \n  You can add `https://github.com/ChebanovDD/Match3-SDK.git?path=src/Match3.UnityPackage/Assets/Plugins/Match3` to the Package Manager.\n\n  If you want to set a target version, Match3-SDK uses the `v*.*.*` release tag, so you can specify a version like `#v0.1.2`.

These animations will be used further.\n\n\u0421reate a class `ItemsSlideOutJob` and inherit from the `Job`.\n\n```csharp\npublic class ItemsSlideOutJob : Job\n{\n    private const float FadeDuration = 0.15f;\n    private const float SlideDuration = 0.2f;\n\n    private readonly IEnumerable<IUnityItem> _items;\n\n    public ItemsSlideOutJob(IEnumerable<IUnityItem> items, int executionOrder = 0) : base(executionOrder)\n    {\n        _items = items; // Items to animate.\n    }\n\n    public override async UniTask ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)\n    {\n        var itemsSequence = DOTween.Sequence();\n\n        foreach (var item in _items)\n        {\n            // Calculate the item destination position.\n            var destinationPosition = item.GetWorldPosition() + Vector3.right;\n\n            _ = itemsSequence\n                .Join(item.Transform.DOMove(destinationPosition, SlideDuration)) // Smoothly move the item.\n                .Join(item.SpriteRenderer.DOFade(0, FadeDuration)); // Smoothly hide the item.\n        }\n\n        await itemsSequence.SetEase(Ease.Flash).WithCancellation(cancellationToken);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen create a class `ItemsSlideInJob`.\n\n```csharp\npublic class ItemsSlideInJob : Job\n{\n    private const float FadeDuration = 0.15f;\n    private const float SlideDuration = 0.2f;\n\n    private readonly IEnumerable<IUnityItem> _items;\n\n    public ItemsSlideInJob(IEnumerable<IUnityItem> items, int executionOrder = 0) : base(executionOrder)\n    {\n        _items = items; // Items to animate.\n    }\n\n    public override async UniTask ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)\n    {\n        var itemsSequence = DOTween.Sequence();\n\n        foreach (var item in _items)\n        {\n            // Save the item current position.\n            var destinationPosition = item.GetWorldPosition();\n\n            // Move the item to the starting position.\n            item.SetWorldPosition(destinationPosition + Vector3.left);\n                      \n            // Reset the sprite alpha to zero.\n            item.SpriteRenderer.SetAlpha(0);\n            \n            // Reset the item scale.\n            item.SetScale(1);\n            \n            // Activate the item game object.\n            item.Show();\n\n            _ = itemsSequence\n                .Join(item.Transform.DOMove(destinationPosition, SlideDuration)) // Smoothly move the item.\n                .Join(item.SpriteRenderer.DOFade(1, FadeDuration)); // Smoothly show the item.\n        }\n\n        await itemsSequence.SetEase(Ease.Flash).WithCancellation(cancellationToken);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nJobs with the same `executionOrder` run in parallel. Otherwise, they run one after the other according to the `executionOrder`.\n\n<details><summary>Execution Order Demonstration</summary>\n<br />\n  \n  <table>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">SlideOutJob: 0 <br /> SlideInJob: 0</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">SlideOutJob: 0 <br /> SlideInJob: 1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28132516/160768394-60a238ca-dd67-413e-bd16-941e80ba295c.gif\" alt=\"ItemsSlideAnimation\" />\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28132516/160781807-7ec6ee2e-7474-4d14-a516-21fae758fa50.gif\" alt=\"ItemsSlideAnimation\" />\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>\n</details>\n  \n### Create fill strategy\n\nFirst of all, create a class `SidewayFillStrategy` and inherit from the `IBoardFillStrategy<TGridSlot>`.\n\nWe'll need an `IUnityGameBoardRenderer` to transform grid positions to world positions and an `IItemsPool<TItem>` to get the pre-created items from the pool. Let's pass them to the constructor.\n\n```csharp\npublic class SidewayFillStrategy : IBoardFillStrategy<IUnityGridSlot>\n{\n    private readonly IItemsPool<IUnityItem> _itemsPool;\n    private readonly IUnityGameBoardRenderer _gameBoardRenderer;\n\n    public SidewayFillStrategy(IUnityGameBoardRenderer gameBoardRenderer, IItemsPool<IUnityItem> itemsPool)\n    {\n        _itemsPool = itemsPool;\n        _gameBoardRenderer = gameBoardRenderer;\n    }\n\n    public string Name => \"Sideway Fill Strategy\";\n\n    public IEnumerable<IJob> GetFillJobs(IGameBoard<IUnityGridSlot> gameBoard)\n    {\n        throw new NotImplementedException();\n    }\n\n    public IEnumerable<IJob> GetSolveJobs(IGameBoard<IUnityGridSlot> gameBoard,\n        SolvedData<IUnityGridSlot> solvedData)\n    {\n        throw new NotImplementedException();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen let's implement the `GetFillJobs` method. This method is used to fill the playing field.\n\n```csharp\npublic IEnumerable<IJob> GetFillJobs(IGameBoard<IUnityGridSlot> gameBoard)\n{\n    // List of items to show.\n    var itemsToShow = new List<IUnityItem>();\n\n    for (var rowIndex = 0; rowIndex < gameBoard.RowCount; rowIndex++)\n    {\n        for (var columnIndex = 0; columnIndex < gameBoard.ColumnCount; columnIndex++)\n        {\n            var gridSlot = gameBoard[rowIndex, columnIndex];\n            if (gridSlot.CanSetItem == false)\n            {\n                continue;\n            }\n\n            // Get an item from the pool.\n            var item = _itemsPool.GetItem();\n\n            // Set the position of the item.\n            item.SetWorldPosition(_gameBoardRenderer.GetWorldPosition(gridSlot.GridPosition));\n\n            // Set the item to the grid slot.\n            gridSlot.SetItem(item);\n\n            // Add the item to the list to show.\n            itemsToShow.Add(item);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Create a job to show items.\n    return new[] { new ItemsShowJob(itemsToShow) };\n}\n```\n\nNext, we implement the `GetSolveJobs` method. This method is used to deal with solved sequences of items.\n\n```csharp\npublic IEnumerable<IJob> GetSolveJobs(IGameBoard<IUnityGridSlot> gameBoard,\n    SolvedData<IUnityGridSlot> solvedData)\n{\n    // List of items to hide.\n    var itemsToHide = new List<IUnityItem>();\n\n    // List of items to show.\n    var itemsToShow = new List<IUnityItem>();\n\n    // Iterate through the solved items.\n    // Get unique and only movable items.\n    foreach (var solvedGridSlot in solvedData.GetUniqueSolvedGridSlots(true))\n    {\n        // Get a new item from the pool.\n        var newItem = _itemsPool.GetItem();\n\n        // Get the current item of the grid slot.\n        var currentItem = solvedGridSlot.Item;\n\n        // Set the position of the new item.\n        newItem.SetWorldPosition(currentItem.GetWorldPosition());\n\n        // Set the new item to the grid slot.\n        solvedGridSlot.SetItem(newItem);\n\n        // Add the current item to the list to hide.\n        itemsToHide.Add(currentItem);\n\n        // Add the new item to the list to show.\n        itemsToShow.Add(newItem);\n\n        // Return the current item to the pool.\n        _itemsPool.ReturnItem(currentItem);\n    }\n\n    // Iterate through the special items (can be empty).\n    // Get all special items except occupied.\n    foreach (var specialItemGridSlot in solvedData.GetSpecialItemGridSlots(true))\n    {\n        var item = _itemsPool.GetItem();\n        item.SetWorldPosition(_gameBoardRenderer.GetWorldPosition(specialItemGridSlot.GridPosition));\n\n        specialItemGridSlot.SetItem(item);\n        itemsToShow.Add(item);\n    }\n\n    // Create jobs to hide and show items using the animations we created above.\n    return new IJob[] { new ItemsSlideOutJob(itemsToHide), new ItemsSlideInJob(itemsToShow) };\n}\n```\n\n> **Note:** The `SolvedSequences` & `SpecialItemGridSlots` can contain overlapping items.\n\nOnce the `SidewayFillStrategy` is implemented. Register it in the `AppContext` class.\n\n```csharp\npublic class AppContext : MonoBehaviour, IAppContext\n{\n    ...\n\n    private IBoardFillStrategy<IUnityGridSlot>[] GetBoardFillStrategies(IUnityGameBoardRenderer gameBoardRenderer,\n        IItemsPool<IUnityItem> itemsPool)\n    {\n        return new IBoardFillStrategy<IUnityGridSlot>[]\n        {\n            ...\n            new SidewayFillStrategy(gameBoardRenderer, itemsPool)\n        };\n    }\n    \n    ...\n}\n```\n\n<details><summary>Video Demonstration</summary>\n<br />\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28132516/160768194-4dd0688d-b91c-4130-94fc-a49e951898db.mp4\n\n</details>\n\n### Create level goal\n\nLet's say we want to add a goal to collect a certain number of specific items. First of all, create a class `CollectItems` and inherit from the `LevelGoal<TGridSlot>`.\n\n```csharp\npublic class CollectItems : LevelGoal<IUnityGridSlot>\n{\n    private readonly int _contentId;\n    private readonly int _itemsCount;\n\n    private int _collectedItemsCount;\n\n    public CollectItems(int contentId, int itemsCount)\n    {\n        _contentId = contentId;\n        _itemsCount = itemsCount;\n    }\n\n    public override void OnSequencesSolved(SolvedData<IUnityGridSlot> solvedData)\n    {\n        // Get unique and only movable items.\n        foreach (var solvedGridSlot in solvedData.GetUniqueSolvedGridSlots(true))\n        {\n            if (solvedGridSlot.Item.ContentId == _contentId)\n            {\n                _collectedItemsCount++;\n            }\n        }\n\n        if (_collectedItemsCount >= _itemsCount)\n        {\n            MarkAchieved();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOnce the level goal is implemented. Don't forget to register it in the `LevelGoalsProvider`.\n\n```csharp\npublic class LevelGoalsProvider : ILevelGoalsProvider<IUnityGridSlot>\n{\n    public LevelGoal<IUnityGridSlot>[] GetLevelGoals(int level, IGameBoard<IUnityGridSlot> gameBoard)\n    {\n        return new LevelGoal<IUnityGridSlot>[]\n        {\n            ...\n            new CollectItems(0, 25)\n        };\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Create sequence detector\n\nLet's implement a new sequence detector to detect square shapes. Create a class `SquareShapeDetector` and inherit from the `ISequenceDetector<TGridSlot>`.\n\nFirst of all, we have to declare an array of lookup directions.\n\n```csharp\npublic class SquareShapeDetector : ISequenceDetector<IUnityGridSlot>\n{\n    private readonly GridPosition[][] _squareLookupDirections;\n\n    public SquareShapeDetector()\n    {\n        _squareLookupDirections = new[]\n        {\n            new[] { GridPosition.Up, GridPosition.Left, GridPosition.Up + GridPosition.Left },\n            new[] { GridPosition.Up, GridPosition.Right, GridPosition.Up + GridPosition.Right },\n            new[] { GridPosition.Down, GridPosition.Left, GridPosition.Down + GridPosition.Left },\n            new[] { GridPosition.Down, GridPosition.Right, GridPosition.Down + GridPosition.Right },\n        };\n    }\n\n    public ItemSequence<IUnityGridSlot> GetSequence(IGameBoard<IUnityGridSlot> gameBoard, GridPosition gridPosition)\n    {\n        throw new NotImplementedException();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen let's implement the `GetSequence` method.\n\n```csharp\npublic ItemSequence<IUnityGridSlot> GetSequence(IGameBoard<IUnityGridSlot> gameBoard, GridPosition gridPosition)\n{\n    var sampleGridSlot = gameBoard[gridPosition];\n    var resultGridSlots = new List<IUnityGridSlot>(4);\n\n    foreach (var lookupDirections in _squareLookupDirections)\n    {\n        foreach (var lookupDirection in lookupDirections)\n        {\n            var lookupPosition = gridPosition + lookupDirection;\n            if (gameBoard.IsPositionOnBoard(lookupPosition) == false)\n            {\n                break;\n            }\n\n            var lookupGridSlot = gameBoard[lookupPosition];\n            if (lookupGridSlot.HasItem == false)\n            {\n                break;\n            }\n\n            if (lookupGridSlot.Item.ContentId == sampleGridSlot.Item.ContentId)\n            {\n                resultGridSlots.Add(lookupGridSlot);\n            }\n        }\n\n        if (resultGridSlots.Count == 3)\n        {\n            resultGridSlots.Add(sampleGridSlot);\n            break;\n        }\n\n        resultGridSlots.Clear();\n    }\n\n    return resultGridSlots.Count > 0 ? new ItemSequence<IUnityGridSlot>(GetType(), resultGridSlots) : null;\n}\n```\n\nFinally, add the `SquareShapeDetector` to the sequence detector list in the `AppContext` class.\n\n```csharp\npublic class AppContext : MonoBehaviour, IAppContext\n{\n    ...\n\n    private ISequenceDetector<IUnityGridSlot>[] GetSequenceDetectors()\n    {\n        return new ISequenceDetector<IUnityGridSlot>[]\n        {\n            ...\n            new SquareShapeDetector()\n        };\n    }\n\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n### Create special item\n\nLet's create a stone item that is only destroyed when a match happens in one of the neighbour tiles.\n\nAdd a `Stone` value to the `TileGroup` enum.\n\n```csharp\npublic enum TileGroup\n{\n    Unavailable = 0,\n    Available = 1,\n    Ice = 2,\n    Stone = 3\n}\n```\n\nCreate a class `StoneState` and inherit from the `StatefulGridTile`.\n\n```csharp\npublic class StoneState : StatefulGridTile\n{\n    private bool _isLocked = true;\n    private bool _canContainItem;\n    private int _group = (int) TileGroup.Stone;\n\n    // Defines the tile group id.\n    public override int GroupId => _group;\n    \n    // Prevents the block from move.\n    public override bool IsLocked => _isLocked;\n    \n    // Prevents the item creation.\n    public override bool CanContainItem => _canContainItem;\n\n    // Occurs when all block states have completed.\n    protected override void OnComplete()\n    {\n        _isLocked = false;\n        _canContainItem = true;\n        _group = (int) TileGroup.Available;\n    }\n\n    // Occurs when the block state is reset.\n    protected override void OnReset()\n    {\n        _isLocked = true;\n        _canContainItem = false;\n        _group = (int) TileGroup.Stone;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo respond to any changes in one of the neighbour tiles, we have to implement an `ISpecialItemDetector<TGridSlot>` interface. Create a `StoneItemDetector` class and inherit from the `ISpecialItemDetector<TGridSlot>`.\n\n```csharp\npublic class StoneItemDetector : ISpecialItemDetector<IUnityGridSlot>\n{\n    private readonly GridPosition[] _lookupDirections;\n\n    public StoneItemDetector()\n    {\n        _lookupDirections = new[]\n        {\n            GridPosition.Up,\n            GridPosition.Down,\n            GridPosition.Left,\n            GridPosition.Right\n        };\n    }\n\n    public IEnumerable<IUnityGridSlot> GetSpecialItemGridSlots(IGameBoard<IUnityGridSlot> gameBoard,\n        IUnityGridSlot gridSlot)\n    {\n        if (gridSlot.IsMovable == false)\n        {\n            yield break;\n        }\n\n        foreach (var lookupDirection in _lookupDirections)\n        {\n            var lookupPosition = gridSlot.GridPosition + lookupDirection;\n            if (gameBoard.IsPositionOnGrid(lookupPosition) == false)\n            {\n                continue;\n            }\n\n            var lookupGridSlot = gameBoard[lookupPosition];\n            if (lookupGridSlot.State.GroupId == (int) TileGroup.Stone)\n            {\n                yield return lookupGridSlot;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOnce the `StoneItemDetector` is implemented. Register it in the `AppContext` class.\n\n```csharp\npublic class AppContext : MonoBehaviour, IAppContext\n{\n    ...\n\n    private ISpecialItemDetector<IUnityGridSlot>[] GetSpecialItemDetectors()\n    {\n        return new ISpecialItemDetector<IUnityGridSlot>[]\n        {\n            ...\n            new StoneItemDetector()\n        };\n    }\n    \n    ...\n}\n```\n\nNext, move on to setting up the scene and prefabs.\n\nFirst of all, add a block state sprites to the `TilesSpriteAtlas` and create a `StoneTilePrefab` prefab varian from the `StatefulBlankPrefab`.\n\n<details><summary>Prefab Variant Creation</summary>\n<br />\n\n![CreatePrefabVariant](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28132516/164171867-3f8b90bf-98d0-482f-bd9e-8d5209932398.png)\n\n</details>\n\nConfigure the `StoneTilePrefab` by adding the `StoneState` script to it and filling in a `State Sprite Names` list.\n\n![ConfigureStoneTilePrefab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28132516/164176865-91287ec1-abf5-4c9b-989f-4ee52b2c2630.png)\n\n> **Note:** You can create more than one visual state for a block by adding more state sprites.\n\nFinally, select a `GameBoard` object in the scene and add the `StoneTilePrefab` to a `GridTiles` list of the `UnityGameBoardRenderer` script.\n\n<details><summary>Video Demonstration</summary>\n<br />\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28132516/164196506-80ebe446-7a7a-4ae6-930c-46586f1b2c25.mp4\n\n</details>\n\n## :bookmark_tabs: Contributing\n\nYou may contribute in several ways like creating new features, fixing bugs or improving documentation and examples.\n\n### Discussions\n\nUse [discussions](https://github.com/ChebanovDD/Match3-SDK/discussions) to have conversations and post answers without opening issues.\n\nDiscussions is a place to:\n* Share ideas\n* Ask questions\n* Engage with other community members\n\n### Report a bug\n\nIf you find a bug in the source code, please [create bug report](https://github.com/ChebanovDD/MatchSweets/issues/new?assignees=ChebanovDD&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=).\n\n> Please browse [existing issues](https://github.com/ChebanovDD/MatchSweets/issues) to see whether a bug has previously been reported.\n\n### Request a feature\n\nIf you have an idea, or you're missing a capability that would make development easier, please [submit feature request](https://github.com/ChebanovDD/MatchSweets/issues/new?assignees=ChebanovDD&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=).\n\n> If a similar feature request already exists, don't forget to leave a \"+1\" or add additional information, such as your thoughts and vision about the feature.\n\n### Show your support\n\nGive a :star: if this project helped you!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/chebanovdd\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-orange.png\" alt=\"Buy Me A Coffee\" style=\"height: 60px !important;width: 217px !important;\" ></a>\n\n## :balance_scale: License\n\nUsage is provided under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n"

It was originally\nwritten for [FAUST CTF 2015](https://www.faustctf.net/2015/), but is designed to be re-usable for other\ncompetitions.\n\nWhat's included\n---------------\nThe gameserver consists of multiple components. They may be deployed separately of each other as their only\nmeans of communication is a shared database.\n\n* Web: A [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)-based web application for team registration and\n  scoreboards. It also contains the model files, which define the database structure.\n* Controller: Coordinates the progress of the competition, e.g. the current tick and flags to be placed.\n* Checker: Offers an interface for checker scripts, which place and retrieve flags and test the status of\n  services.\n* Submission: Server to submit captured flags to.\n* Lib: Some code that is shared between the components.\n\nFor deployment instructions and details on the implementations, see the `README`s of the individual\ncomponents.\n\nRelated projects\n----------------\nThere are several alternatives out there, although none of them could really convince us. Your mileage may\nvary at this point.\n\n* ucsb-seclab/ictf-framework from the team behind iCTF, one of the most well-known\n  attack-defense CTFs. In addition to a gameserver, it includes utilities for VM creation and network setup.\n  We had trouble to get it running and documentation is generally rather rare.\n* HackerDom/checksystem is the gameserver powering the RuCTF. The first impression wasn't too bad, but it\n  didn't look quite feature-complete to us. However, we didn't really grasp the Perl code, so we might have\n  overlooked something.\n* isislab/CTFd appears to be de-facto standard for [jeopardy-based CTFs](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/). It\n  is, however, not suitable for an attack-defense CTF.\n\nAnother factor for the creation of our own system was that we didn't want to build a large CTF on top of a\nsystem which we don't entirely understand.\n\nDesign principles\n-----------------\nThe software will probably only be used once a year for severals hours, but it has to work reliably then. It\nwill hopefully continue to be used by future generations. These requirements led to the incorporation of\nsome principles:\n\n* Non-complex solutions: Keep the amount of code low and chose the less fancy path. That's why we use the\n  built-in Django admin interface instead of writing a custom admin dashboard \u2013 it'll be good enough for the\n  few people using it.\n* Few external dependencies: Of course one shouldn't re-invent the wheel all over again, but every external\n  dependency means another moving part. Some libraries you always have to keep up with, others will become\n  unmaintained. We therefore focus on few, mature, well-chosen external dependencies. That's why we use a\n  plain old Makefile instead of [Bower](http://bower.io/) for JavaScript dependencies and Django's built-in\n  PBKDF2 instead of fancy [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) for password hashing.\n* Extensive documentation: This should be a no-brainer for any project, although it is easier said than done.\n* Re-usability: The gameserver should be adjustable to your needs with some additional lines of code. An\n  example for such customizations can be found in the `faustctf-2015` branch of this repository.\n* Scalability: We couldn't really estimate the load beforehand, nor could we easily do realistic\n  load-testing. That's why the components are loosely coupled and can be run on different machines.\n\nLicensing\n---------\nThe whole gameserver is released under the MIT (expat) license. Contributions are welcome!\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Serious Engine\n========================\n\nThis is the source code for Serious Engine v.1.10, including the following projects:\n\n* `DedicatedServer`\n* `Ecc` The *Entity Class Compiler*, a custom build tool used to compile *.es files\n* `Engine` Serious Engine 1.10\n* `EngineGUI` Common GUI things for game tools\n* `EntitiesMP` All the entity logic\n* `GameGUIMP` Common GUI things for game tools\n* `GameMP` All the game logic\n* `Modeler` Serious Modeler\n* `RCon` Used to connect to servers using an admin password\n* `SeriousSam` The main game executable\n* `SeriousSkaStudio` Serious Ska Studio\n* `WorldEditor` Serious Editor\n* `DecodeReport` Used to decode crash *.rpt files\n* `Depend` Used to build a list of dependency files based on a list of root files\n* `LWSkaExporter` Exporter for use in LightWave\n* `MakeFONT` Used for generating *.fnt files\n* `Shaders` Compiled shaders\n* `GameAgent` The serverlist masterserver written in Python\n* `libogg`, `libvorbis` Third party libraries used for playing OGG-encoded ingame music (see http://www.vorbis.com/ for more information)\n\nThese have been modified to run correctly under the recent version of Windows. (Tested: Win7 x64, Win8 x64, Win8.1 x64)\n\nBuilding\n--------\n\nTo build Serious Engine 1, you'll need Visual Studio 2013 or 2015, Professional or Community edition ( https://www.visualstudio.com/post-download-vs?sku=community ).\n\nDo not use spaces in the path to the solution.\n\nOnce you've installed Visual Studio and (optionally) DirectX8 SDK, you can build the engine solution (`/Sources/All.sln`). Press F7 or Build -> Build solution. The libraries and executables will be put into `\\Bin\\` directory (or `\\Bin\\Debug\\` if you are using the Debug configuration).\n\nOptional features\n-----------------\n\nDirectX support is disabled by default. If you need DirectX support you'll have to download DirectX8 SDK (headers & libraries) ( http://files.seriouszone.com/download.php?fileid=759 or https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812 ) and then enable the SE1_D3D switch for all projects in the solution (Project properties -> Configuration properties -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor definitions -> Add \"SE1_D3D\" for both Debug and Release builds). You will also need to make sure the DirectX8 headers and libraries are located in the following folders (make the folder structure if it's not existing yet):\n* `/Tools.Win32/Libraries/DX8SDK/Include/..`\n* `/Tools.Win32/Libraries/DX8SDK/Lib/..`\n\nMP3 playback is disabled by default. If you need this feature, you will have to copy amp11lib.dll to the '\\Bin\\' directory (and '\\Bin\\Debug\\' for MP3 support in debug mode). The amp11lib.dll is distributed with older versions of Serious Sam: The First Encounter.\n\n3D Exploration support is disabled in the open source version of Serious Engine 1 due to copyright issues. In case if you need to create new models you will have to either use editing tools from any of the original games, or write your own code for 3D object import/export.\n\nIFeel support is disabled in the open source version of Serious Engine 1 due to copyright issues. In case if you need IFeel support you will have to copy IFC22.dll and ImmWrapper.dll from the original game into the `\\Bin\\` folder.\n\nRunning\n-------\n\nThis version of the engine comes with a set of resources (`\\SE1_10.GRO`) that allow you to freely use the engine without any additional resources required. However if you want to open or modify levels from Serious Sam Classic: The First Encounter or The Second Encounter (including most user-made levels), you will have to copy the game's resources (.GRO files) into the engine folder. You can buy the original games on Steam, as a part of a bundle with Serious Sam Revolution ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/227780 )\n\nWhen running a selected project, make sure its project settings on Debugging is set to the right command:\n* For debug:\n    $(SolutionDir)..\\Bin\\Debug\\$(TargetName).exe`\n* For release:\n    $(SolutionDir)..\\Bin\\$(TargetName).exe`\nAnd its working directory:\n    $(SolutionDir)..\\\n\nCommon problems\n---------------\n\nBefore starting the build process, make sure you have a \"Temp\" folder in your development directory. If it doesn't exist, create it.\nSeriousSkaStudio has some issues with MFC windows that can prevent the main window from being displayed properly.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nSerious Engine is licensed under the GNU GPL v2 (see LICENSE file).\n\nSome of the code included with the engine sources is not licensed under the GNU GPL v2:\n\n* zlib (located in `Sources/Engine/zlib`) by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler\n* LightWave SDK (located in `Sources/LWSkaExporter/SDK`) by NewTek Inc.\n* libogg/libvorbis (located in `Sources/libogg` and `Sources/libvorbis`) by Xiph.Org Foundation\n"

  "readme_contents": "# GameStream Launchpad \ud83d\ude80\n\n![](demo.gif)\n\nGameStream Launchpad (GSLP) offers a configurable environment for NVIDIA GameStream sessions with your PC from NVIDIA Shield hardware and/or [Moonlight](https://github.com/moonlight-stream) clients. The tool is made with popular launchers in mind and is extensible to any use case through custom config files. By running GSLP as a \"game\" through Moonlight or SHIELD instead of adding games or launchers directly, it improves the GameStream experience by doing the following when the session opens:\n\n 1. Sets a **custom display resolution** on the host only while the session is open.\n 2. Opens and maximizes **your favorite game launcher**, which allows you to do things such as display games from multiple stores (IE: Playnite for Steam, Origin, Epic, Xbox GamePass, etc).\n 3. Launches **your background programs** which close at the end of the session (such as a controller remapping program you like to use when streaming only).\n 4. Automatically **ends the GameStream session** and reverts the host resolution when the launcher window is closed.\n \nConfigurations are included for **[Playnite](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite)** fullscreen mode, **[RetroArch](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch)**, **[GOG Galaxy 2](https://www.gog.com/galaxy)**, and a general purpose remote desktop.\n\n## Basic Setup\n 1. Install [Playnite](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite) (recommended, supports controllers) or [GOG Galaxy 2](https://www.gog.com/galaxy) and configure it to your liking.\n 2. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/cgarst/gamestream_launchpad/releases/) and extract the files somewhere.\n 3. Open GeForce experience and navigate to Settings > SHIELD > ADD.\n 4. In the file picker, select the `.bat` script with the launcher and resolution you want your computer to have during the GameStream.\n \n## Customization\nThere are two types of configurable files:\n 1. A `.ini` file that describes the launcher's path, window name, your desired background programs, and other settings.\n 2. A `.bat` file which launches GSLP describing which `.ini` file and which host resolution to use.\n \nA different launcher or custom location can be defined in a new `.ini` config file like the included ones. New resolutions can be added by making a new `.bat` file like the examples. The config's included example launches [JoyToKey](https://joytokey.net/en/), which would allow you to map additional button mapping/combo functions. Some ideas for controller remapping would be to map to Shift-Tab for Steam overlay, Win-G for Xbox gamebar, Win-Alt-PrintScr for screenshot, or Win key for cutscene pauses.\n\nThe config file supports an unlimited number of background processes. Paths can be defined with environment variables, or just regular absolute paths. A debug mode can be enabled here which will leave the console window running to check the output after a session. You can also specify if you want the session to end when the game launcher window is closed (default), or not until the process is totally killed.\n\nExample config for Playnite:\n```\n[LAUNCHER]\n# The path to your Playnite.FullscreenApp.exe\nlauncher_path = %%LOCALAPPDATA%%\\Playnite\\Playnite.FullscreenApp.exe\n# Name of the window to watch to close the session when it's gone\nlauncher_window_name = Playnite\n\n[BACKGROUND]\n# List as many exe's or bat's as you want here. They will run at the start of the GameStream session and be killed at the end.\n# background_exe_1 = C:\\Program Files (x86)\\JoyToKey\\JoyToKey.exe\n# background_exe_2 = C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\mspaint.exe\n\n[SETTINGS]\n# Set debug = 1 to leave a window running after gamestream to see error messages from GSLP\ndebug = 0\n# Set sleep_on_exit to 1 to put the computer to sleep after the session\nsleep_on_exit = 0\n# Set close_watch_method to \"process\" to wait for the launcher process to totally die to exit (can be problematic if it closes to tray), or \"window\" to just wait the the window to close\nclose_watch_method = window\n```\n\n## Resolution Recommendations\nIn most cases, the ideal resolution is the one closest to your client system running Moonlight or the NVIDIA app. Make sure to set the client-side streaming quality option at or above the resolution used by GSLP. A resolution can only be set when your system already supports it. However, custom resolutions can be added through the NVIDIA Control Panel's \"Change resolution\" settings. Additionally, you can still run a 1440p or 4k stream on a system with a 1080p monitor by enabling DSR Factors in the NVIDIA Control Panel's \"Manage 3D Settings\" globals.\n\nIf your client device's native resolution isn't 16:9 then you will likely need to enable a client-side option to stretch the video to fit your screen. The Moonlight client offers this option in it's settings.\n\n## Development\n\n### Developer Dependencies\n 1. Install [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/) for Windows, ensuring that you select \"Add Python to PATH\" during installation.\n 2. Install [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) via `pip install pipenv`.\n\n### Developer Setup\n 1. Clone this repo.\n 2. In the repo directory, run `pipenv.exe install` to setup the Python environment.\n 3. Ensure that things are working by running `pipenv.exe run gamestream_launchpad.py 1280 720 gamestream_playnite.ini` and closing Playnite.\n 4. Build the exe with `build.bat`\n\n"

  "readme_contents": "# SteamCMD-AutoUpdate-Any-Gameserver\n\nWindows SteamCMD to automaticly update and install any game server\n\nI am sure all of you on windows have been seeking for this for a long time.\n\nThis will work for all game servers and keep them all automaticly updated. You may also use this to freshly and easly install game servers too. Inside my script i have written a little a detail on each function and what it is executing and the result. For those of you who are command line enthusiasts like myself.\n\n\n#Why did i bother to make this ?\nI got borred and when i get borred i have to do something productive this being the result. (I am a workaholic)\n\nIt is a command line file what you should replace your existing .bat / .cmd scripts with, One automatic updater per each game server you wish to run.\n\n\n#Features :\nsteam.cmd is only dependant upon VBScript.\n\nsteam-curl.cmd is dependant upon CURL, VBScript and Windows Powershell.\n\nWill download extract and install steamcmd.exe if it does not exist in the directory specified from http://media.steampowered.com/installer/steamcmd.zip\n\nWorks with both 32bit and 64bit architecture.\n\nInstall game server.\n\nKeep server updated on a interval (interval of updates is defined in seconds).\n\nShould work with both Normal versions of Windows and Server versions.\n\nSuppress application hung messages to prevent server crash problems.\n\nAnnounces to players ingame that the server is shutting down/restarting for updates.\n\n\n#Requirements :\nYou need to have a SteamDEV API key you can obtain one from the following link :\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey\n\nCertain servers for specific games require you to use a login on SteamCMD so specify your login in the script.\n\nSteamCMD.exe downloaded from :\n\nhttp://media.steampowered.com/installer/steamcmd.zip\n\n\n#F.A.Q\nI edited beyond the \"Do not edit\" point and now it does not work ?\nI told you in the file not to touch anything beyond that point. (Just redownload the script to get a default working version.)\n\n\n#Known bugs / issues :\nIf your game server is to crash you may have to wait for the next automatic update check as defined by the interval so the script checks if the game server is infact running or not. (Current soloution is to keep the update interval to a max of 10-15mins so if your server crashes it is not offline for long) set interval=60 (1 minute)\n\nCertain Appid's for installation of game server will be different to the update id due to Steam's DEV API not containing the latest avaliable server version (yet!?)\n\nExample :\n\nhttp://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUserStats/GetSchemaForGame/v2/?key=YOURKEYHERE&appid=740&format=json\n\n\n#How to use :\nChoose either steam.cmd or steam-CURL.cmd\n\nThe steam.cmd file uses VBScript and steam-curl.cmd is dependant on CURL and Windows Powershell.\n\nBoth will automaticly download and install game servers upon running either script.\n\nThere are two different appid's you might have to specify for your game server to automaticly update. Since some games for example CS:GO has a seperate appid for the updater url than the appid you would use to install the game server as show below.\n\nInstall CS:GO server appid = 740\n\nset appid=740\n\nAuto Update URL appid = 730\n\nset update_appid=730\n\nYou will know if you have to set a different appid for the update url if the contents of your latest-version.txt show this.\n\n```\n{\n    \"game\": {\n\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo get the correct Auto Updater APPID just go to the store page for the game in question and it will be at the end of the URL link.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/730/\n\n\n#Configuration : (EDIT | steam.cmd file)\n\nIn order to configure the script just edit the \"*.cmd\" file and define your install directory and server type.\n\nPlease drop a reply if you have a question / issue i shall try to help you as much as i can.\n\n\nCURL (Generic) 32bit and 64bit executable from | http://curl.haxx.se/download.html#Win32\n"

These can be run in emulators, but aren't able to be played on actual hardware.\nYou'll need to convert the ELF file into a GBA rom. There's a `cargo-make` file in this repository to do this, and it relies on a tool called `gbafix`\nto assign the right header data to the ROM when packing it.\n\n```sh\ncargo install cargo-make\ncargo install gbafix\n```\n\n## Project Setup\n\nTo build a GBA project, you'll want to copy the `.cargo/config.toml` file from this repo into your own project.\n\nThen use one of the examples as a guide to get started.\n\nWhen you build your project, cargo will put outputs in the `target/thumbv4t-none-eabi/` directory.\nThis includes the `debug/` and `release/` sub-directories.\nYour binary will be in there, but it'll be in ELF format.\nYou can run this directly in an emulator such as [mGBA](https://mgba.io/) if you'd like.\n\nWhen you're ready to convert your program into a \"proper\" GBA rom you'll need to run an `objcopy`\nto extract just the raw binary data:\n```\narm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary [RUST_BINARY_NAME] [ROM_NAME].gba\n```\n\nThen you'll need to patch the header data with `gbafix`\n```\ngbafix [ROM_NAME].gba\n```\nAnd you'll be all done!\n\n# Contribution\n\nThis crate is tri-licensed under Zlib / Apache-2.0 / MIT.\nAny contributions you submit must be licensed the same.\n"

  "readme_contents": "StarlingMVC Framework\n===========\n\nStarlingMVC is an IOC framework for use in games built using the great [Starling framework](http://gamua.com/starling/). Closely modelled after established IOC frameworks like [Swiz](http://swizframework.org/) and [RobotLegs](http://www.robotlegs.org/), StarlingMVC features:\n* Dependency Injection(DI)/Inversion of Control(IOC)\n* View Mediation\n* Event Handling\n* Stays out of the way of your Starling game code\n* Simple configuration\n* Easily extended\n* More utilities to help with your game code\n\nStarlingMVC Framework is provided under the [Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\n\nRequirements\n------------\n* [Flex SDK 4.6](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/flex-sdk-download.html)\n* [Starling 1.1](http://gamua.com/starling/)\n* [FlexUnit 4.1 (For running the unit tests)](http://www.flexunit.org/)\n\nContributors\n------------\n* [Creative Bottle, Inc](http://www.creativebottle.com)\n* [Scott Jeppesen](mailto:scott.jeppesen@creativebottle.com)\n* [Tom McAvoy](mailto:tom.mcavoy@creativebottle.com)\n\nSetup\n------------\nGetting your Starling project configured to work with StarlingMVC requires only a few lines of code. From your base Starling display class (starling.display.*), you need to create an instance of StarlingMVC and provide it the root Starling display object, an instance of StarlingMVCConfig, and some Beans.\n\n```as3\npackage com.mygame.views\n{\n  \timport com.creativebottle.starlingmvc.StarlingMVC;\n\timport com.creativebottle.starlingmvc.config.StarlingMVCConfig;\n\timport com.creativebottle.starlingmvc.views.ViewManager;\n \timport com.mygame.models.GameModel;\n\n\timport starling.core.Starling;\n\timport starling.display.Sprite;\n\n\tpublic class GameMain extends Sprite\n\t{\n\t\tprivate var starlingMVC:StarlingMVC;\n\n\t\tpublic function GameMain()\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tvar config:StarlingMVCConfig = new StarlingMVCConfig();\n\t\t\tconfig.eventPackages = [\"com.mygame.events\"];\n\t\t\tconfig.viewPackages = [\"com.mygame.views\"];\n\n\t\t\tvar beans:Array = [new GameModel(), new ViewManager(this)];\n\n\t\t\tstarlingMVC = new StarlingMVC(this, config, beans);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThe StarlingMVCConfig instance above tells StarlingMVC which event packages and view packages it should mediate.\nThe beans Array is merely a collection of objects. The array can accept an object of any type. The framework will handle it accordingly.\n\n### Additional setup steps for Flash Builder\nWhen exporting release builds using Flash Builder, the ActionScript compiler will strip out non-standard metadata unless it is instructed otherwise. StarlingMVC's custom metadata is required in order for powerful features such as automatic dependency injection (DI) to work correctly and so the removal of the metadata can effectively render your application useless.\n\nPreventing the removal (or \"stripping\") of StarlingMVC's custom metadata is simple and just requires some additional compiler arguments to be set for your project.\n\nTo add the additional compiler arguments, right-click your project and click Properties. Next go to \"ActionScript Compiler\" and under \"Additional compiler arguments\" add the following:\n```\n-keep-as3-metadata+=Dispatcher\n-keep-as3-metadata+=EventHandler\n-keep-as3-metadata+=Inject\n-keep-as3-metadata+=Juggler\n-keep-as3-metadata+=PostConstruct\n-keep-as3-metadata+=ViewAdded\n-keep-as3-metadata+=ViewRemoved\n```\nYou will now be able to export release builds and StarlingMVC will function as expected.\n\nBeans\n------------\nA Bean is an instance of an object that is provided to StarlingMVC to manage. Beans can be injected, receive injections, and handle events. There are several ways that beans can be provided to StarlingMVC during setup:\n### Object instance\n```as3\nvar beans:Array = [new GameModel(), new ViewManager(this)];\n```\n\n\n### Bean instances\n```as3\nvar beans:Array = [new Bean(new GameModel()), new Bean(new ViewManager(this))];\n```\nProviding a Bean instance as shown above does not give much benefit. However, there is an option second parameter to thw Bean constructor that allows for an id. If you provide an id then you can use the id during dependency injection. Additionally, beans are stored within the framework by class type unless you provide an id. So if you have two beans of the same type you will need to specify an id or subsequent beans will overwrite the previous beans. For example:\n```as3\nvar beans:Array = [new Bean(new GameModel(),\"gameModelEasy\"),new Bean(new GameModel(),\"gameModelHard\"), new ViewManager(this)];\n```\n\n### BeanProvider instances\nA BeanProvider is a collection of Beans. The beans within the provider, like with a simple array, can be of any type, including BeanProvider.\n```as3\npackage com.mygame.config\n{\n\timport com.creativebottle.starlingmvc.beans.BeanProvider;\n\timport com.mygame.assets.AssetModel;\n\timport com.mygame.models.AudioModel;\n\timport com.mygame.models.GameModel;\n\n\tpublic class Models extends BeanProvider\n\t{\n\t\tpublic function Models()\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tbeans = [new GameModel(), new Bean(new AudioModel(),\"audioModel\"), new AssetModel()];\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\nOnce you have your BeanProvider set up, you can pass that as a part of your original beans array.\n```as3\nvar beans:Array = [new Models(), new ViewManager(this)];\n```\n\n### ProtoBeans\nA ProtoBean is a bean that is created at the time of injection. Where normal beans require a class instance, a ProtoBean requires a class and an id.\n```as3\nvar beans:Array = [new ProtoBean(Character,\"character\"), new ViewManager(this)];\n```\nUsing a ProtoBean here will allow StarlingMVC to create the instances of this class for you. Each time it is injected, it will be a new instance of the, in this case, \"Character\" class instead of using a singleton like a normal Bean. The advantage to allowing the framework to create the class over just using \"new Character()\" is that when StarlingMVC creates the instance it will run injection and all processing on the created instance.\n\nDependency Injection\n------------\nDependency injection occurs on all beans and all Starling display objects. A dependency is denoted with an `Inject` metadata tag over a public property or getter/setter. Injection can be done by type:\n```as3\npackage com.mygame.controllers\n{\n\tpublic class GameController\n\t{\n\t\t[Inject]\n\t\tpublic var gameModel:GameModel;\n\n\t\tpublic function GameController():void\n\t\t{\n\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\nor by id, if an id was specified when the bean was created:\n```as3\npackage com.mygame.controllers\n{\n\tpublic class GameController\n\t{\n\t\t[Inject(source=\"gameModel\")]\n\t\tpublic var gameModel:GameModel;\n\n\t\tpublic function GameController():void\n\t\t{\n\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\nIn the above example, if the GameModel is a normal bean, the framework will set the value to the singleton instance that was created during setup. If it was a protobean, a new instance will be created and injected into the property.\n\nStarling also supports injecting properties of beans. In order to use this functionality, the source Bean must contain an id (i.e. `new Bean(new GameModel(),\"gameModel\");`). To inject a property of a bean, simply append the property name to the end of the id parameter in your Inject tag:\n```as3\npackage com.mygame.controllers\n{\n\tpublic class GameController\n\t{\n\t\t[Inject(source=\"gameModel\")]\n\t\tpublic var gameModel:GameModel;\n\n\t\t[Inject(source=\"userModel.currentUser\")]\n\t\tpublic var currentUser:User;\n\n\t\tpublic function GameController():void\n\t\t{\n\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\nIn the example above, the value of the `currentUser` property on the `userModel` bean would be injected into the currentUser property of our controller. This functionality is also recursive. If you wanted to inject the first name of the currentUser you could potentially use `[Inject(source=\"userModel.currentUser.firstName\")]`.\n\n### Binding\nThe InjectProcessor also supports a very simple binding mechanism that will cause injected properties to be automatically refreshed when they are changed.\n```as3\npackage com.mygame.controllers\n{\n\tpublic class GameController\n\t{\n\t\t[Inject(source=\"gameModel\")]\n\t\tpublic var gameModel:GameModel;\n\n\t\t[Inject(source=\"userModel.currentUser\", bind=\"true\")]\n\t\tpublic var currentUser:User;\n\n\t\tpublic function GameController():void\n\t\t{\n\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\nThe example above uses the optional `bind=\"true\"` parameter of the `[Inject]` tag to create a binding.  When the currentUser property of the userModel is updated StarlingMVC will automatically update any injections using binding. This will also work with getter/setters methods. Using these will allow code to easily react to changes in the properties.\n```as3\npackage com.mygame.controllers\n{\n\tpublic class GameController\n\t{\n\t\t[Inject(source=\"gameModel\")]\n\t\tpublic var gameModel:GameModel;\n\n\t\t[Inject(source=\"userModel.currentUser\", bind=\"true\")]\n\t\tpublic function set currentUser(value:User):void\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t_currentUser = value;\n\n\t\t\t// Do something to update your UI with the new value\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tpublic function get currentUser():User\n\t\t{\n\t\t\treturn _currentUser;\n\t\t}\n\t\tprivate var _currentUser:User;\n\n\t\tpublic function GameController():void\n\t\t{\n\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\nBinding is connected directly to the Starling juggler instance and will check for changes on each bound property everytime the `advanceTime()` method is called. This does not provide a binding that works as instantaneously as Flex binding. Binding should be used sparingly as there is still overhead to check for changes to the bound properties.\n\nAs an alternative to auto bound properties, StarlingMVC supports binding through invalidation. This method is much more efficient than the auto bound properties because it give you much more control over when properties are updated. This is done through an injected `Bindings` class and the optional \"auto\" parameter.\n```as3\npackage com.mygame.controllers\n{\n\tpublic class GameController\n\t{\n\t\t[Inject(source=\"gameModel\")]\n\t\tpublic var gameModel:GameModel;\n\n\t\t[Inject(source=\"userModel.currentUser\", bind=\"true\", auto=\"false\")]\n\t\tpublic function set currentUser(value:User):void\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t_currentUser = value;\n\n\t\t\t// Do something to update your UI with the new value\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tpublic function get currentUser():User\n\t\t{\n\t\t\treturn _currentUser;\n\t\t}\n\t\tprivate var _currentUser:User;\n\n\t\tpublic function GameController():void\n\t\t{\n\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\npackage com.mygame.models\n{\n\tpublic class UserModel\n\t{\n\t\t[Bindings]\n\t\tpublic var bindings:Bindings;\n\n\t\tpublic function set currentUser(value:User):void\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tif(value != _currentUser)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t_currentUser = value;\n\n\t\t\t\tbindings.invalidate(this, \"currentUser\");\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tpublic function get currentUser():User\n\t\t{\n\t\t\treturn _currentUser;\n\t\t}\n\t\tprivate var _currentUser:User;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nEvents\n------------\n### Dispatching Events\nEvents in StarlingMVC are dispatched in one of two ways:\n1) StarlingMVC contains a global instance of `starling.events.EventDispatcher`. The quickest way to dispatch an event into the StarlingMVC framework is to use this dispatcher. This dispatcher can be injected into your bean by using the `[Dispatcher]` metadata tag.\n2) DisplayObjects can dispatchEvents using their own `dispatchEvent()` method. This is only available to DisplayObjects and the events must set `bubbles=true'.\n\n### Handling Events\nEvent handlers are denoted by using the `[EventHandler(event=\"\")]` metadata tag on a public method of a bean. The event argument in the tag can contain one of two options: the event type string\n```as3\npackage com.mygame.controllers\n{\n\tpublic class GameController\n\t{\n\t\t[EventHandler(event=\"scoreChanged\")]\n\t\tpublic function scoreChanged(event:ScoreEvent):void\n\t\t{\n\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\nor the typed event\n```as3\npackage com.mygame.controllers\n{\n\tpublic class GameController\n\t{\n\t\t[EventHandler(event=\"ScoreEvent.SCORE_CHANGED\")]\n\t\tpublic function scoreChanged(event:ScoreEvent):void\n\t\t{\n\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\nBy using the second approach, you will gain the benefit that StarlingMVC will type check any of the events during initialization and throw and error if the event or event type doesn't exist. This protects against typos.\n\nIn both examples above, the handler must accept the type of the dispatched event to handle. However, a second optional parameter exists in the EventHandler tag that will allow you to specify specific properties of the event to use as parameters to the event handler. For example:\n```as3\npackage com.mygame.controllers\n{\n\tpublic class GameController\n\t{\n\t\t[EventHandler(event=\"ScoreEvent.SCORE_CHANGED\", properties=\"user, newScore\")]\n\t\tpublic function scoreChanged(user:User, newScore:int):void\n\t\t{\n\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\nIn the above example, instead of passing the entire event into the handler, StarlingMVC will pass only the \"user\" and \"newScore\" properties. Note that the types must match or an error will be thrown.\n\nView Mediation\n------------\nView mediators are a great way of keeping your view classes separate from the code that controls them. A view mediator is set up just like any other bean. To link a view to a view mediator a `[ViewAdded]` metadata tag is used on a public method. When a DisplayObject is added to the stack, StarlingMVC will look for instances of the ViewAdded tag. If the parameter of any ViewAdded methods are of the type of the view that was just added, the new DisplayObject will be passed to that method. To unlink a mediator from a view when the view has been removed the `[ViewRemoved]` metadata tag is used.\n```as3\npackage com.mygame.mediators\n{\n\tpublic class GameMediator\n\t{\n\t\tprivate var view:Game;\n\n\t\t[ViewAdded]\n\t\tpublic function viewAdded(view:Game):void\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tthis.view = view;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t[ViewRemoved]\n\t\tpublic function viewRemoved(view:Game):void\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tthis.view = null;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\nBean Lifecycle\n------------\nNormal beans are set up on initialization. However, since the dependency injection and event handling happens after creation bean values are not available immediately. To receive notification of when a bean has been fully processed we can add the `[PostConstruct]` tag to a public method. This method will be automatically called when all DI has been completed. Similarly, when a bean is being destroyed we can specify a public method to be called with the `[PreDestroy]` tag. This works in all standard beans and DisplayObjects.\n```as3\npackage com.mygame.controllers\n{\n\tpublic class GameController\n\t{\n\t\t[Inject]\n\t\tpublic var gameModel:GameModel;\n\n\t\t[PostConstruct]\n\t\tpublic function postConstruct():void\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t// set up code here\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t[PreDestroy]\n\t\tpublic function preDestroy():void\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t// tear down code here\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t[EventHandler(event=\"ScoreEvent.SCORE_CHANGED\", properties=\"user, newScore\")]\n\t\tpublic function scoreChanged(user:User, newScore:int):void\n\t\t{\n\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\npackage com.mygame.controllers\n{\n\tpublic class GameModel\n\t{\n\t\t[Bindings]\n\t\tpublic var bindings:Bindings;\n\n\t\tpublic function set score(value:int):void\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tif(value != _score)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t_score = value;\n\n\t\t\t\tbindings.invalidate(this, \"score\");\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tpublic function get score():int\n\t\t{\n\t\t\treturn _score;\n\t\t}\n\t\tprivate var _score:int;\n\t}\n}\n```\nIn the above example you can see that in the controller the Inject tag includes \"auto='false'\". This disables the auto binding so that a check is not done on every iteration of the Juggler. In the GameMode, we are injecting the Bindings instance and then invalidating manually when the property changes. Once the property is invalidated, it will be automatically updated on the next pass of the juggler.\n\nManual Bean Creation/Removal\n------------\nManual bean creation and removal is done through the event system. Dispatching `BeanEvent.ADD_BEAN` will add and process a new bean. Dispatching `BeanEvent.REMOVE_BEAN` will remove the bean from the system.\n```as3\npackage com.mygame.view\n{\n\tpublic class Game\n\t{\n\t\tpublic var gamePresentationModel:GamePresentationModel;\n\n\t\t[PostConstruct]\n\t\tpublic function postConstruct():void\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tgamePresentationModel = new GamePresentationModel();\n\n\t\t\tdispatchEvent(new BeanEvent(BeanEvent.ADD_BEAN, gamePresentationModel));\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t[PreDestroy]\n\t\tpublic function preDestroy():void\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tdispatchEvent(new BeanEvent(BeanEvent.REMOVE_BEAN, gamePresentationModel));\n\n\t\t\tgamePresentationModel = null;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\nIn the example above, we create a presentation model for our view and add it to StarlingMVC as a bean. In doing this, the PM will be processed as a bean and gain all of the benefits of DI and EventHandling.\n\nCommand Pattern\n------------\nStarlingMVC includes support for the command pattern. Commands are essentially beans that are created when a specified event is dispatched, executed, and then disposed of. To add a command to the framework, an instance of the Command class should be added to the beans.\n```as3\npackage com.mygame.views\n{\n  \timport com.creativebottle.starlingmvc.StarlingMVC;\n\timport com.creativebottle.starlingmvc.config.StarlingMVCConfig;\n\timport com.creativebottle.starlingmvc.views.ViewManager;\n \timport com.mygame.models.GameModel;\n\n\timport starling.core.Starling;\n\timport starling.display.Sprite;\n\n\tpublic class GameMain extends Sprite\n\t{\n\t\tprivate var starlingMVC:StarlingMVC;\n\n\t\tpublic function GameMain()\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tvar config:StarlingMVCConfig = new StarlingMVCConfig();\n\t\t\tconfig.eventPackages = [\"com.mygame.events\"];\n\t\t\tconfig.viewPackages = [\"com.mygame.views\"];\n\n\t\t\tvar beans:Array = [new GameModel(), new ViewManager(this), new Command(DoSomethingEvent.DO_SOMETHING, DoSomethingCommand)];\n\n\t\t\tstarlingMVC = new StarlingMVC(this, config, beans);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\nThis will map the event to the command. The command class can receive all of the same injections as any other bean. It cannot handle events, however, since the instance will only exist long enough to execute a single command. The method to execute in the command instance is noted with the `[Execute]` metadata.\n```as3\npackage com.mygame.commands\n{\n\timport com.mygame.events.NavigationEvent;\n\timport com.mygame.models.BubbleModel;\n\n\timport starling.events.EventDispatcher;\n\n\tpublic class DoSomethingCommand\n\t{\n\t\t[Dispatcher]\n\t\tpublic var dispatcher:EventDispatcher;\n\n\t\t[Inject]\n\t\tpublic var bubbleModel:BubbleModel;\n\n\t\t[Execute]\n\t\tpublic function execute(event:DoSomethingEvent):void\n\t\t{\n\t\t\ttrace(\"did something!\");\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\nIn this example, whenever the `DoSomethingEvent.DO_SOMETHING` is dispatched, StarlingMVC will create an instance of DoSomethingCommand, run the execute method, and then dispose of the instance. The Command class also contains an optional parameter called runOnce.\n```as3\npackage com.mygame.views\n{\n  \timport com.creativebottle.starlingmvc.StarlingMVC;\n\timport com.creativebottle.starlingmvc.config.StarlingMVCConfig;\n\timport com.creativebottle.starlingmvc.views.ViewManager;\n \timport com.mygame.models.GameModel;\n\n\timport starling.core.Starling;\n\timport starling.display.Sprite;\n\n\tpublic class GameMain extends Sprite\n\t{\n\t\tprivate var starlingMVC:StarlingMVC;\n\n\t\tpublic function GameMain()\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tvar config:StarlingMVCConfig = new StarlingMVCConfig();\n\t\t\tconfig.eventPackages = [\"com.mygame.events\"];\n\t\t\tconfig.viewPackages = [\"com.mygame.views\"];\n\n\t\t\tvar beans:Array = [new GameModel(), new ViewManager(this), new Command(DoSomethingEvent.DO_SOMETHING, DoSomethingCommand, true)];\n\n\t\t\tstarlingMVC = new StarlingMVC(this, config, beans);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\nIn this example, the command bean is added with the following line: `new Command(DoSomethingEvent.DO_SOMETHING, DoSomethingCommand, true)`. The optional last parameter, `true`, specifies that this command should be run once. So in this case, when the DO_SOMETHING event is dispatched, the framework would create an instance of DoSomethingCommand, run execute, dispose of the instance, and then remove the mapping. This functionality is very useful for initialization commands.\n\nEventMap\n------------\nEventMap is a utility class for creating and managing event listeners. Using EventMap exclusively to create listeners within your class makes cleanup very easy.\n```as3\npackage com.mygame.mediators\n{\n\timport com.creativebottle.starlingmvc.events.EventMap;\n\n\tpublic class GameMediator\n\t{\n\t\tprivate var eventMap:EventMap = new EventMap();\n\n\t\t[ViewAdded]\n\t\tpublic function viewAdded(view:Game):void\n\t\t{\n\t\t\teventMap.addMap(view.playButton,TouchEvent.TOUCH, playButtonTouched);\n\t\t\teventMap.addMap(view.instructionsButton,TouchEvent.TOUCH, instructionsTouched);\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t[ViewRemoved]\n\t\tpublic function viewRemoved(view:Game):void\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tevent.removeAllMappedEvents();\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tprivate function playButtonTouched(event:TouchEvent):void\n\t\t{\n\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tprivate function instructionsButtonTouched(event:TouchEvent):void\n\t\t{\n\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\nJuggler\n------------\nThe Juggler class in Starling is used to handle all animation within a game. For a class to take advantage of the Juggler instance, it must implement the IAnimatable interface but defining `advanceTime(time:Number)`. The global juggler reference can be accessed as a static property of Starling as `Starling.juggler1`. However, this property can also be directly injected into your class instances using the `[Juggler]` tag.\n ```as3\n package com.mygame.mediators\n {\n \timport com.creativebottle.starlingmvc.events.EventMap;\n\n \tpublic class GameMediator implements IAnimatable\n \t{\n \t\t[Juggler]\n        public var juggler:Juggler;\n\n \t\t[ViewAdded]\n \t\tpublic function viewAdded(view:Game):void\n \t\t{\n \t\t\tjuggler.add(this);\n \t\t}\n\n \t\t[ViewRemoved]\n \t\tpublic function viewRemoved(view:Game):void\n \t\t{\n \t\t    juggler.remove(this);\n \t\t}\n\n \t\tpublic function advanceTime(time:Number):void\n \t\t{\n            // do some animation logic\n \t\t}\n \t}\n }\n ```\n\nViewManager\n------------\nViewManager is a utility class to facilitate creating views and adding/removing them from the stage. When creating the instance of ViewManager the constructor requires a reference to the root view of the game (i.e. `new ViewManager(this)`) from the root DisplayObject. Adding the ViewManager instance to the StarlingMVC beans makes it easy to swap views from anywhere in the Starling application.\n### setView\nCalls to setView will remove existing views and add the new view. ViewManager handles instantiating the view and adding it to the stack.\n```as3\npackage com.mygame.controllers\n{\n\tpublic class NavigationController\n\t{\n\t\t[Inject]\n\t\tpublic var viewManager:ViewManager;\n\n\t\t[EventHandler(event=\"NavigationEvent.NAVIGATE_TO_VIEW\", properties=\"viewClass\")]\n\t\tpublic function navigateToView(viewClass:Class):void\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tviewManager.setView(viewClass);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n### addView\nCalls to addView will add a new view on top of the existing view. This is handy for popups, HUDs, etc. Whereas setView accepts a parameter of type Class, addView accepts a view instance.\n```as3\npackage com.mygame.views\n{\n\tpublic class Game\n\t{\n\t\t[Inject]\n\t\tpublic var viewManager:ViewManager;\n\n\t\tprivate var hud:GameHUD;\n\n\t\t[PostConstruct]\n\t\tpublic function postConstruct():void\n\t\t{\n\t\t\thud = new GameHUD();\n\n\t\t\tviewManager.addView(hud);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n### removeView\nCalls to removeView will remove the specified view from the stack.\n### removeAll\nCalls to removeAll will remove all views from the stack. This is called automatically when calling `setView()`.\n"

This comes with the barebones IDLE editor. There are other editors you can use. On Windows, you can also use the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor. [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) is an editor for Windows, Linux, and macOS. You can also use a browser-based editor like [REPL.it](https://repl.it/). These are all free.\n\nThen, click in the `src` and `gamesbyexample` folders in this repo to find the `.py` files of various Python games. For example, this is the code for [snailrace.py](https://github.com/asweigart/PythonStdioGames/blob/master/src/gamesbyexample/snailrace.py). The code for each game its entirely in one `.py` file, so you can copy the code directly into your editor. I recommend typing it in by hand, rather than using copy-paste. This will give you \"muscle memory\" of each part of the code. (Though some of these games require you download a data file into the same folder as your `.py` file.) Then you can run the program. If you get error messages, note the line number in the error message and check for typos you've made.\n\nAfter learning basic syntax, many programmers want to move on to the next step and see how these programming concepts are used in \"real\" programs. Most open source projects are far too large and complicated. These games have been designed to be short, simple, and fun. You can use them as learning examples to see how to make your own programs.\n\nNote that some programs require you to download an extra file from this repo. For example, the `[sudoku.py](https://github.com/asweigart/PythonStdioGames/blob/master/src/gamesbyexample/sudoku.py)` game loads its puzzles from the `[sudokupuzzles.txt](https://github.com/asweigart/PythonStdioGames/blob/master/src/gamesbyexample/sudokupuzzles.txt)` file.\n\n\nAbout this Collection\n=====================\n\nAfter beginners learn the syntax of Python and basic programming concepts (loops, branching, functions, etc.) they often hit a dead-end: \"How do I become better at programming?\" At this point, people will tell them to work on their own practice projects (which leaves them without guidance on what to make and how to make it) or to contribute to open source projects (which can be difficult to find, understand its code base, and get guidance on how to contribute).\n\nWhat helped me learn to code was finding small projects whose source code I copied and then made small adjustments to. This gave me insight on how loops, branching, and functions combined together into actual programs.\n\nTo help others down the same path, I'm creating a collection of example programs aimed at being easy to copy and understand by beginners. These programs (mostly games) have the following constraints:\n\n* They're short, with a limit of 256 lines of code. *This makes them easy to read and understand in one sitting. The shorter the better. The \"256\" number was arbitrarily selected, but this also means programs will fit on 4 or 5 printed pages.*\n* They fit into a single source code file and have no installer. *This makes these games trivial to share by copy/pasting code to a pastebin site. Data/image/save files can be used, but the source should link to some examples in their comments.*\n* They only use the Python standard library. *Fewer things to install means wider compatibility and less chance of failing during environment setup.*\n* They only use stdio text; `print()` and `input()` in Python. *The output being in the same text medium as the text source code makes it less abstract, and easier to see the cause-effect relationship between code and output. This means there's no graphics or mouse input, but makes it simple to port these programs to other languages since they all support stdio text.*\n* They're necessarily turn-based. *Relying on `input()` means the program must wait for the user to enter text, but this means we can't have real-time programs that respond to single key-presses.*\n* They're well commented. *Comments should be aimed at beginners and will be more verbose. The 256-line limit includes comments and whitespace. If the program is too long to include abundant comments and sensible whitespace, the program should be simplified, not the comments.*\n* They use as few programming concepts as possible. *If classes, list comprehensions, recursion, aren't necessary for the program, then they are't used.*\n* **Elegant** and **efficient** code is worthless next to code that is **easy to understand** and **readable**. *These programs are for education, not production. Standard best practices, like not using global variables, can be ignored to make it easier to understand.*\n* They do input validation and are bug free. *It should be impossible to crash a program with bad input or an edge case.*\n* All functions have docstrings. *This is good documentation practice, but also enables the `help()` function to work in the interactive shell.*\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines\n=====================\n\nAdditional guidelines include:\n\n* Don't use f-strings. Raspberry Pis as of 2019 have Python 3.5 installed, and f-strings only came about in 3.6. One guideline for these programs is to be as widely compatible as possible.\n* Some of these programs use the `bext` module, which adds curses-like features like color, clearing the screen, and moving the cursor\n* Include a link to a run-through of the program on https://pythontutor.com so that the student can see how the program runs.\n* Longer, more descriptive variable names are better than shorter ones. Avoid using single-letter variable names except for `i` and `j`, or `x` and `y`.\n* Have comments marked as `# (!)` that describe minor changes that they can make (increasing health, changing difficulty, etc.)\n* Use jsdifflib to create online diffs. *This is an easy way for students to find their own typos when copying the code. An example is here: https://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/diff/*\n* Use `assert` statements to catch common typos the student makes when typing in the code, especially for constants that they may modify.\n* Use Python 3. *The only time Python 2 is appropriate to use is when there's a large existing codebase. But this is for new programmers working on greenfield projects.*\n* Stick to characters in WGL4 character repertoire, which is basically CP 1252, code pages for Cyrillic/Greek/Turkish/Baltic characters, and the MS-DOS era CP437 \"extended ASCII\" encoding. *Windows' command line is the limiting factor here; it can't display all UTF-8 characters.*\n* The source code must be typeable. *Don't put box-drawing or extended ascii characters directly into the source code, but rather make chr() calls instead to acquire these characters.*\n* Time can be a factor, even if the programs aren't real-time. *You can check for time or add pauses in between calls to `input()`, but note that you'll never be able to interrupt when the user is typing.*\n* The `pyperclip` module can be used to interact with the clipboard. *Large amounts of text can be input-ed into or output-ed from the program using the clipboard.*\n* I use %s string interpolation instead of f-strings. *I love f-strings, but they were only introduced in Python 3.6 and I don't want to limit the versions that these programs are compatible with.*\n* For all dictionaries, I have a short comment explaining what types the keys and values are. *For example, # Keys=places, values=strings of the suspect & item there.*\n* Use the \"DOS box-drawing\" characters to draw complicated board games. *Though sticking to +, -, and | for lines is good too since it's simpler.*\n* Player vs player games can often be simpler and shorter than player vs computer games. *This necessarily means that multiplayer games must be \"perfect information\" games since both players can view the screen.*\n* Don't modify mutable objects (e.g. lists) in functions to pass information into/out of the function; only use parameters and return values. *This can make your program seem magical to someone not familiar with the Python Data Model.*\n* Avoid insulting the player when they lose. *This is something I learned from instructing programming classes for kids. They respond poorly to messages like, \"Game Over, Dummy!\" even if they seem innocuous to adults.*\n\nAfter making several of these programs, I've notice various \"categories\" of program complexity. Programs can be of zero or more of these categories:\n\n* Absolute beginner level. *No functions, no nested data structures, avoid nested loops. Just uses simple branching and loops.*\n* Choose-your-own-adventure level. *Programs don't model things with data structures, but rather mostly use flow control.*\n* STDIO-only. *You can't undo things that have been previously printed (aside from \"printing\" backspace characters to erase characters on the current line). The output is like an append-only log file.*\n* Curses-like. *Requires the `bext` module, but can clear/refresh the screen, draw at arbitrary places on the screen in color, etc.*\n* Modify source code to run. *Instead of getting input from `input()`, the user edits variables at the top of the file to change the settings in the program.*\n\n\nAdditional modules I recommend using:\n\n* `bext` for colorful text and controlling the positioning of the text cursor.\n* `blessings` for a better version of curses.\n* `pyperclip` for copying/pasting text with the clipboard.\n* `playsound` for playing audio files.\n* `pyttsx3` for text to speech.\n* `pytextcavas` for 2D strings you can draw on\n* `pyrect` for rectangle data structure\n* `pybresenham` for various line-drawing functions\n\n\nCompleted Programs in This Collection\n=====================================\n\n*Alphabetize Quiz* - A time-based quiz game to see how fast you can alphabetize letters.\n\n*Alphabetize Word Quiz* - A time-based quiz game to see how fast you can alphabetize words.\n\n*Analog Clock* - An analog clock animation.

  "readme_contents": "ActorX - Unreal Actor Exporter\n==============================\n\nBuilding the source code\n------------------------\n\nWe are using own build system to compile ActorX. You may find a Perl script in `./genmake`. This script\ngenerates makefiles from some human-friendly project format. After that you may build generated makefile\nusing `nmake` for Visual Studio or `make` for gcc.\n\nThere's a build script which iterates over all available SDKs and issues build for all available SDK platofrms.\nThis script could be found in `./build.sh`\n\nActorX is compiled using Visual Studio. Currently build is performed with Visual C++ 2019, but in theory\nalmost all Visual Studio versions should be supported (perhaps except Visual C++ 6.0 and Visual C++ 2001).\n\nBuild system utilizes GNU Tools for building, in particular - Bash and Perl. I've packaged Windows versions\nof such tools which was a part of [MinGW/MSYS project](http://www.mingw.org/). You get may everything you need\nfor a build [here](https://github.com/gildor2/UModel/releases). This page contains **BuildTools.zip**. You should\ndownload it and extract into some directory, let's say to *C:\\BuildTools*. After that, put *C:\\BuildTools\\bin*\nto the system *PATH* variable. Also it is possible to create a batch file which will temporarily tune *PATH* and\nthen execute build script. Here's an example of such file:\n\n    @echo off\n    set PATH=%PATH%;C:\\BuildTools\\bin\n    bash build.sh\n\nTo launch a build process without a batch, simply execute\n\n    bash build.sh\n\n\nThis command line will issue building ActorX plugin for all available supported SDKs. If you want to build a particular\nversion, use this command line format:\n\n    bash build.sh <SDK_Ver>\n\n(see description of SDK_Ver format below)\n\n\nSDK\n---\n\nSDK are not distributed for legal reasons. You should download them from corresponding developer's sites and place\nunder /SDK directory (relative to the project's root). Directory layout for x86/x64 mixed platofrms is:\n\n    /SDK\n      /<SDK_Ver>\n         /include\n         /lib\n         /x64\n           /lib\n\n`<SDK_Ver> ::= (Max|Maya)(Year)[_x64]`\n\nAll includes goes to `<SDK_Ver>/include`, x86 libraries to `<SDK_Ver>/lib`, x64 libraries to `<SDK_Ver>/x64/lib`.\nFor x64-only SDK's, use the following layout:\n\n    /SDK\n      /Max2014_x64\n         /include\n         /lib\n\nAll libraries should go to the `<SDK_Ver>/lib` directory. Suffix `_x64` of SDK's directory name is required.\n\nBuild script is intended to work with Max and Maya versions starting from 2012 year, but it should work well with older\nversions too.\n\nWeb resources\n-------------\n\n[Plugin announcements and discussion thread on Gildor.org](http://www.gildor.org/smf/index.php/topic,1221.0.html)\n\n[Original plugin home page](http://udn.epicgames.com/Three/ActorX.html)\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nActorX plugin is licensed under the [BSD license](LICENSE.txt).\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Text-games\nThis repository provides text game simulators for research purposes.\n\n### User-friendly version\nIf you just want to have a sense with what text-based games look like, you can try the following .html based version:\n - [Saving John](http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/competition2013/web/savingjohn/Saving%20John.html)\n - [Machine of Death](http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/competition2013/web/machineofdeath/MachineOfDeath.html)\n - [Fantasy World](http://horizondark.com:8000/webclient/) (Thanks to Karthik for providing the reference.)\n\n### Python simulators (under text-games/simulators/, dependencies: Python 2.7)\nThis directory contains three text game simulators, including **Saving John** and **Machine of Death** mentioned in [1], and **Fantasy World** mentioned in [2].\n\n**Saving John** and **Machine of Death** are converted from their original .html source codes. They are stand-alone simulators and should be easy to run from text-games/simulators/MySimulator.py\n\n**Fantasy World** requires installing the [Evennia package and text-world](https://github.com/mrkulk/text-world). The game is played in socket mode. If you are more familar with python, you don't have to install the Lua framework provided by [text-world-player](https://github.com/karthikncode/text-world-player). After you have installed both Evennia and text-world, the following steps should be done to start the server and create the world:\n - On the server end, ./start.sh 1 # assuming we initiate only one game server\n - create superuser with username \"root\" and password \"root\"\n - On the client end, nc localhost 4001\n - connect root root\n - @batchcommand tutorial_world.build\n - @quell\n - quit the client connection\n\nTo run the game, simply:\n```\npython text-games/simulators/MySimulator.py --name savingjohn --doShuffle True\n```\nNote that the _name_ could be \"savingjohn\", \"machineofdeath\", or \"fantasyworld\". Setting the _doShuffle_ to True will randomly shuffle the list of actions every time they are presented. After typing the above command, you will see the following tuple of (state-text, list of action-texts, reward). The action order may differ:\n\n>('It\\'s difficult to breathe.     My psychiatrist says that in order to be saved, one must want to be saved. \"Are you alright?\" Cherie calls from the deck. The waves don\\'t give me a chance to respond. Instinctively,  my eyes turn upward as I\\'m being pulled under. Please, not yet. \"John!\"  I want a second chance. It\\'s Cherie\\'s hand, reaching out, but for some reason it slips  away. My mind\\'s going in circles and I need to focus on  something, anything. I grab on to the first thought that  seems coherent:', [\"I don't deserve to live.\", \"It's not her fault.\", \"She can't save me.\", \"She's trying to kill me!\"], 0)\n\nYou can continue the game by typing your choice of action (in integer number). For example, typing 0 (choosing \"I don't deserve to live.\") at the above state will transition to the next tuple:\n\n>('//\"Knock, knock.\"//\\\\n//\"Uh, who\\'s there?\"//\\\\n//\"Orange.\"//\\\\n//\"Hey, shut the fuck up over there!\"//\\\\n//\"Are you seriously telling --\"//\\\\n//\"I\\'d like some oranges,\"//\\\\n//\"You don\\'t deserve oranges,\"//\\\\n//\"Well you don\\'t deserve to live!\"//\\\\n//\"Good one,\"//\\\\n\\\\n//Someone laughs.//\\\\n\\\\n//\"--knock knock jokes?\"//\\\\n//\"Orange you glad that I didn\\'t kick your face in?\"//\\\\n//\"Catholic guilt at its best I suppose,\"//\\\\n//\"I need another shot...\"//\\\\n//\"Seriously, face palm,\"//\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s the Fourth of July.

The interface of all three text games are designed so that they share the same interface:\n```\n(text, actions, reward) = mySimulator.Read() # text is a string (state-text), actions is a list of strings, reward is a float\nmySimulator.Act(playerInput)                 # playerInput is an integer or a string, depending on which game\nmySimulator.Restart()                        # after the episode ends, restart the game\n```\n\nFor **Machine of Death**, we also provide a paraphrased action mode. You can import MachineOfDeathSimulator from MySimulator and initialize a second simulator with \"doParaphrase = True\".\n\nThe _name_\\_\\*Id.pickle in text-games/simulators store the vocabulary of each game. _name_\\_\\*wordId.pickle means state-side vocabulary, and _name_\\_\\*actionId.pickle means action-side vocabulary.\n\n### References\n1.

Those athletes are awarded medallions based on the place they finish in the events, and countries compete against each other to see who can win the most medallions. These are the Super Sports Games!\n\n## Standard Deviation\n\nIn this project, we are going to need to find the standard deviation of an array of numbers. Assume we have an array of numbers `[24, 30, 18, 20, 41]`. The steps for finding the standard deviation are:\n\nStep | Description | Operation | Result\n--- | --- | ---- | ---\n0 | input | | [24, 30, 18, 20, 41]\n1 | sum all the integers | 24 + 30 + 18 + 20 + 41 | 133\n2 | find the number of integers in the input array | | 5 |\n3 | divide the sum of the integers (step 1) by the number of integers (step 2). This is the average (also known as the mean). | 133 / 5 | 26.6\n4 | subtract each integer by the average found in step 3 | [24 - 26.6, 30 - 26.6, 18 - 26.6, 20 - 26.6, 41 - 26.6] | [-2.6, 3.4, -8.6, -6.6, 14.4]\n5 | Take the result from step 4 and square each number | [-2.6 ^ 2, 3.4 ^ 2, -8.6 ^ 2, -6.6 ^ 2, 14.4 ^ 2] | [6.76, 11.56, 73.96, 43.56, 207.36]\n6 | sum all the numbers from step 5 | 6.76 + 11.56 + 73.96 + 43.56 + 207.36 | 343.2\n7 | divide the result from step 6 by the number of integers (step 2) | 343.2 / 5 | 68.64\n8 | take the square root of the result from step 7 | sqrt(68.64) | 8.28\n\n# Assignment\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Fork [this Repository](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/super_sports_games)\n1. Clone your forked repo to your machine with git clone <ssh key for your repo>\n  1. Make sure you clone it to a location that makes sense, for example `/Users/your_user_name/turing/1module/projects`.\n\n## Submission\n\nWhen you are ready to turn in the project, submit a pull request from your forked repository to the turingschool-examples repository.\n\n**Make sure to put your name in your PR!**\n\n## Iteration 1 - Standard Deviation\n\nOpen up the `standard_deviation.rb` file in the `lib` directory. You should see this template:\n\n```ruby\nages = [24, 30, 18, 20, 41]\n\n# Your code here for calculating the standard deviation\n\n# When you find the standard deviation, print it out\n```\n\nWrite code to find the standard deviation and print it to the screen. (You should not use any built-in code or gems for finding the standard deviation or average)\n\n## Iteration 2 - Event Class\n\nCreate an `Event` class given the following criteria:\n\n* An `Event` is initialized with two arguments\n  * The first is a string representing the name of the event\n  * The second is an Array of integers representing the ages of participants in the event.\n* An `Event` has getter methods called `name` and `ages` for reading the name and ages of the event.\n* An `Event` has a method called `max_age` that returns the largest age as an integer\n* An `Event` has a method called `min_age` that returns the smallest age as an integer\n* An `Event` has a method called `average_age` that returns the average age as a float rounded to 2 decimal places\n* An `Event` has a method called `standard_deviation_age` that returns the standard deviation of the ages as a float rounded to 2 decimal places.\n\nIf your `Event` class follows all of the criteria, you should be able to run the `games_test.rb` test and see all of the tests pass.\n\nAlso, if the previous criteria are met, you should be able to interact with the `Event` class from a Pry session like so:\n\n```ruby\npry(main)> require './lib/event'\n#=> true\n\npry(main)> event = Event.new(\"Curling\", [24, 30, 18, 20, 41])\n#=> #<Event:0x00007fba3fc42ab0 @ages=[24, 30, 18, 20, 41], @name=\"Curling\">\n\npry(main)> event.name\n#=> \"Curling\"\n\npry(main)> event.ages\n#=> [24, 30, 18, 20, 41]\n\npry(main)> event.max_age\n#=> 41\n\npry(main)> event.min_age\n#=> 18\n\npry(main)> event.average_age\n#=> 26.6\n\npry(main)> event.standard_deviation_age\n#=> 8.28\n```\n\n## Iteration 3 - Testing\n\nWrite tests for your `Event` class that cover that expected behavior described in the previous iteration.\n\n## Iteration 4 - Extensions\n\n* Create a program that allows a User to interact with the Games through the command line\n  * Upon starting the program, the User should enter the year for the games\n  * The User can then create new Events and get a Summary of the Events\n"

Designed for simple single player games such as puzzle games,\nplatformers and side scrollers. Eventually support is planned for tile based games too for real time strategy/tactics.\n\nThis readme and other readme files, are for developers and cover information related to developing and building the engine itself.<br>\nFor end user guide see  [help](editor/dist/help/help.html \"user help\") instead. \n\nOther readmes:\n  * [Audio](audio/README.md \"Audio readme\")\n  * [Graphics](graphics/README.md \"Graphics readme\") (todo)\n  * [Game](game/README.md \"Game readme\") (todo)\n  * [Engine](engine/README.md \"Engine readme\") (todo)\n  * [UI](uikit/README.md \"UIKit readme\") \n  * [WDK](wdk/README.md \"WDK readme\")\n\n![Screenshot](screens/bandit-play.gif \"Bandit demo\")\n\nCurrently supported major features:\n* Qt5 based editor\n* Text rendering\n* Various primitive shapes, custom polygon shapes\n* Material system\n* Particle system\n* Entity system with animation tracks\n* Audio engine\n* Lua based scripting for entities, scenes and game logic\n* Scene builder\n* Styleable UI system \n* Box2D based physics\n* Demo content\n* Game content packaging\n* Window integration (https://github.com/ensisoft/wdk)\n* HTML5/WASM build target support\n\nPlanned major features not yet implemented:\n* tile maps and tile engine\n* partial 3D support for specific objects (think objects such as coins, diamonds, player ship etc.)\n* OpenGL ES3 backend, WebGL2\n\nPlanned minor features not yet implemented:\n* See issues for more details\n\n![Screenshot](screens/editor-animation.png \"Entity editor\")\nCreate your animated game play characters in the entity editor. Each entity can contain an arbitrary render tree\nof nodes with various attachments for physics, rendering and text display. Animation tracks allow changing the properties\nof the nodes and transforming the tree itself over time. Each entity type can then be associated with a Lua script where\nyou can write your entity specific game play code.\n\n![Screenshot](screens/editor-material.png \"Material editor\")\nCreate materials using the material editor by setting some properties for the provided default material shaders.\nCurrently supports sprite animations, textures (including text and noise), gradient and color fills out of box.\nCustom shaders can be used too.\n\n![Screenshot](screens/editor-scene.png \"Scene editor\")\nCreate the game play scenes using the scene editor. The entities you create in the entity editor are available here\nfor placing in the scene. Viewport visualization will quickly show you how much of the game world will be seen when\nthe game plays.\n\n![Screenshot](screens/editor-ui.png \"UI editor\")\nCreate the game's UI in the UI editor. The UI and the widgets can be styled using a JSON based style file and then individual widgets\ncan have their style properties fine tuned in the editor. The style system integrates with the editor's material system too!\n\n![Screenshot](screens/editor-audio.png \"Audio graph editor\")\nCreate audio graphs using the audio editor. Each audio graph can have a number of elements added to it. The graph then\nspecifies the flow of audio PCM data from source elements to processing elements to finally to the graph output. Currently\nsupported audio backends are Waveout on Windows and Pulseaudio on Linux. Supported formats are wav, mp3, ogg and flac.\n\n![Screenshot](screens/editor-script.png \"Script editor\")\nUse the built-in code editor to write the Lua scripts for the entities, scenes or for the game. The editor has a built-in\nhelp system for accessing the engine side Lua API documentation.\n\n![Screenshot](screens/demo-bandit.png \"Editor game play window\")\nDuring the development the game is available for play in the editor. It's possible to do live edits to the\ngame content in the editor and see the changes take place in the play window.\n\nBuild Instructions\n==================\n\nWASM\n------------------------------\nBuilding to WASM currently supported only for the engine but not the editor.\nThe build is separated from the main engine build and is in emscripten/ folder.\n\n- Install emscripten (https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) Note that the\n  location of emsdk is arbitrary, but I've dumped it into gamestudio/ so that my IDE (Clion) can\n  easily find the emscripten headers for C++ tooling (the CMakeLists then has a matching include for this).\n- Currently, the target Emscripten version is 3.0.0. Using other version will likely break things.\n- If using Windows Install Ninja from https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases. Drop the ninja.exe for example\n  into the emsdk folder or anywhere on your PATH.\n\nOn Linux\n\n- Install Emscripten\n```\n  $ cd gamestudio\n  $ git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git\n  $ cd emsdk\n  $ git pull\n  $ ./emsdk install latest\n  $ ./emsdk activate 3.0.0\n  $ source ./emsdk_env.sh\n```\n-- Check your Emscripten installation\n```\n  $ which emcc\n  $ /home/user/emsdk/upstream/emscripten/emcc\n  $ emcc --version\n  $ emcc (Emscripten gcc/clang-like replacement + linker emulating GNU ld) 3.0.0 (3fd52e107187b8a169bb04a02b9f982c8a075205)\n```\n- Build the Gamestudio engine into a WASM blob. Make sure that you have the emscripten tools in your path,\n  i.e. you have sourced emsdk_env.sh in your current shell.\n```\n  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/gamestudio\n  $ cd gamestudio\n  $ git submodule update --init --recursive\n  $ cd emscripten\n  $ mkdir build\n  $ cd build\n  $ emcmake cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\n  $ make -j16 install\n``` \n\nOn Windows\n- Install Emscripten\n```\n  $ cd gamestudio\n  $ git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git\n  $ cd emsdk\n  $ git pull\n  $ emsdk.bat install latest\n  $ emsdk.bat activate 3.0.0\n  $ emsdk_env.bat\n```\n-- Check your Emscripten and Ninja installation\n```\n  $ where emcc\n  $ C:\\coding\\gamestudio\\emsdk\\upstream\\emscripten\\emcc\n  $ C:\\coding\\gamestudio\\emsdk\\upstream\\emscripten\\emcc.bat\n  $ emcc --version\n  $ emcc (Emscripten gcc/clang-like replacement + linker emulating GNU ld) 3.0.0 (3fd52e107187b8a169bb04a02b9f982c8a075205)\n  $ where ninja\n  $ C:\\coding\\gamestudio\\emsdk\\ninja.exe\n  $ ninja --version\n  $ 1.10.2\n```\n- Build the Gamestudio engine into a WASM blob. Make sure you have emcc and ninja in your path i.e. you have\n  ran emsdk_env.bat in your current shell. \n```\n  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/gamestudio\n  $ cd gamestudio\n  $ git submodule update --init --recursive\n  $ cd emscripten\n  $ mkdir build\n  $ cd build\n  $ emcmake cmake .. \n  $ ninja -j8\n  $ ninja -j8 install\n```\n\nIf everything went well there should now be GameEngine.js and GameEngine.wasm files in the editor's dist folder. \nThe .js file contains the JavaScript glue code needed to manhandle the WASM code into the browser's WASM engine\nwhen the web page loads. When a game is packaged for web these files will then be deployed (copied) into the\ngame's output directory.\n\nPenguin Juice (Linux)\n------------------------------\n\n- Install the dev packages.\n  (for Ubuntu based systems)\n```\n  $ sudo apt-get install libboost-dev\n  $ sudo apt-get install qtbase5-dev\n  $ sudo apt-get install libpulse-dev\n```\n- Install Conan build system.\nhttps://docs.conan.io/en/latest/installation.html\n\n- Build the project in RELEASE mode\n```\n  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/gamestudio\n  $ cd gamestudio\n  $ git submodule update --init --recursive\n  $ mkdir build\n  $ cd build\n  $ conan install .. --build missing\n  $ cmake -G \"Unix Makefiles\" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..\n  $ make -j16 install\n  $ ctest -j16\n```\n\n- Build the project in DEBUG mode\n```\n  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/gamestudio\n  $ cd gamestudio\n  $ git submodule update --init --recursive\n  $ mkdir build_d\n  $ cd build_d\n  $ conan install .. --build missing\n  $ cmake -G \"Unix Makefiles\" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..\n  $ make -j16 install\n  $ ctest -j16\n```\n\n- Build the project for profiling using valgrind / kcachegrind\n```\n  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/gamestudio\n  $ cd gamestudio \n  $ git submodule update --init --recursive\n  $ mkdir build_profile\n  $ cd build_profile\n  $ conan install .. --build missing \n  $ cmake -G \"Unix Makefiles\" --DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo\n  $ make -j16 install\n```\nThen in order to profile and analyze the output use the combination of valgrind and kcachegrind.\nFor example:\n```\n  $ cd gamestudio/audio/test/\n  $ valgrind --tool=cachegrind ./audio_test --graph\n  $ kcaghegrind cachegrind.out.XXXXX\n```\n\n\nBoring But Stable (Windows)\n---------------------------------\n\nThese build instructions are for MSVS 2019 Community Edition and for 64bit build.\n\n- Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Community\nhttps://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/\n\n- Install prebuilt Qt 5.15.2\nhttp://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.15/5.15.2/single/qt-everywhere-src-5.15.2.zip\n\n- Install prebuilt Boost 1.72\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.72.0_b1/\n\n- Install conan package manager\nhttps://docs.conan.io/en/latest/installation.html\n\n- Open \"Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019\"\n\nBuild the project in RELEASE mode.\n\n```\n  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/gamestudio\n  $ cd gamestudio\n  $ git submodule update --init --recursive\n  $ mkdir build\n  $ cd build\n  $ conan install .. --build missing\n  $ cmake -G \"Visual Studio 16 2019\" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..\n  $ cmake --build   . --config Release\n  $ cmake --install . --config Release\n```\n\nBuild the project in DEBUG mode. \n\n* Note that on MSVS the library interfaces change between debug/release build configs. (e.g. iterator debug levels). \nThis means that in order to link to 3rd party libraries the debug versions of those libraries must be used.\n\n```\n  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/gamestudio\n  $ cd gamestudio\n  $ git submodule update --init --recursive\n  $ mkdir build_d\n  $ cd build_d\n  $ conan install .. --build missing -s build_type=Debug\n  $ cmake -G \"Visual Studio 16 2019\" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..\n  $ cmake --build   . --config Debug\n  $ cmake --install . --config Debug\n```\n\n\nThe Boring Documentation\n=======================\n\nWorkflow and getting started\n----------------------------\nGoing from a git clone to a running game is known as the \"build workflow\". This involves various steps\ninvolving the source tree of the engine, the source tree of the game, the runtime assets provided with the\nengine and the runtime assets that are part of the game. Overall this will involve several build and packaging steps.\n\nCurrently, only Lua based games are supported. There's a provided game engine that is built into a shared library\nand which contains all the relevant functionality for running a game. That is it will take care of rendering the scene,\nticking the physics engine, handling the UI input as well as invoking the Lua scripts in order to run *your* game code.\nIt's possible to also not use this provided engine but write a completely different engine. In this case the interface\nto implement is the \"Engine\" interface in engine/main/interface.h.\n\nFrom source code to a running game:\n1. Build the whole project as outlined in the **Build Instructions** previously.\n   You will also need to *install* the build targets. Installing not only copies the binaries into the right place\n   but also copies other assets such as GLSL shader files. Without the install step things will not work correctly!\n2. After building launch the Editor from the editor/dist folder.\n3. *In the Editor:* Open your game's workspace folder. This is the folder that contains the workspace.json and content.json files.\n   In Gamestudio this is essentially your \"project\" (It's simply a folder with those two specific files in it).\n4. *In the Editor:* Package your content. (Workspace|Package). Select the assets you want to package (most likely everything).\n   When the packaging process is complete your selected output directory will contain the following:\n   1. The game resources copied over, i.e. shaders, textures, font files etc.\n   2. A content.json file that contains the resource descriptions for your assets that you've built in the editor\n   3. A config.json file that contains the settings for the GameMain to launch the game\n   4. A \"GameMain\" executable and engine library.  These are the default game studio binaries for running your\n      game content after the project has been packaged.\n5. After packaging launch your game by running the GameMain executable in the package output directory.\n\n\nSystem Architecture\n-------------------\n![Archicture diagram](docu/stack.png \"Stack\")\n\nAn overview of the runtime architecture:\n\n1. There's a standard game engine that is built into a shared library called GameEngine.dll or libGameEngine.so.\n2. A launcher application called GameMain will read a config.json file. The JSON file contains information about\n   windowing, context creation etc.\n   1. The launcher application will load the engine library and create an <Engine> object instance.\n   2. The launcher application will create the native window system window and also create the Open GL rendering context\n      which it will then give to the engine instance.\n3. The launcher application will then enter the top-level game loop. Inside the loop it will:\n   1. Process any window system window events to handle pending keyboard/mouse etc. events and pass them to the engine as needed.\n   2. Handle events coming from the engine instance. These could be for example requests to toggle full screen mode.\n   3. Accumulate and track time, call functions to Update, Tick and Draw the app instance.\n\nInside the game engine the following will take place.\n1. The various subsystems are updated and ticked. These include physics, audio, scripting etc.\n2. The renderer is used to draw the current scene.\n3. The engine will handle the input events (mouse, keyboard) coming from the host process and choose the appropriate action.\n   For example If a UI is being shown the input is passed to the UI subsystem. The inputs are then also passed to the\n   game scripting system and ultimately to your game's Lua scripts.\n4. The engine will handle the incoming events/requests from the game itself. For example the game might request a scene\n   to be loaded or the game to be paused.\n\nRunning (Unit) Tests\n--------------------\nThere'a bunch of unit tests that are built as part of the normal build process. Basically anything that begins with\na \"*unit_test_*\" is a unit test. There's a very simple testing utility that is available in base. [test_minimal.h](base/test_minimal.h)  \nIn order to run tests after a successful build:\n\n```\n  $ cd gamestudio/build\n  $ ctest -j16\n```\nCurrently, the expectation is that all cases should pass on Linux. On Windows some of the tests are unfortunately broken.\nIn addition to having the unit tests both the audio and graphics subsystems also have \"rendering\" tests, i.e. playing audio\nor rendering stuff on the screen. The audio systems do not have any automation for checking for correctness. The graphics tests\nwork based on a set of *gold images*. The images are provided as part of this repository but there's the problem that because\nof the differences in OpenGL implementations it's possible that the rendering output is not exactly the same between various\nvendors/implementations (such as NVIDIA, AMD, Intel etc.) This needs to be enhanced so that a set of gold images could be\ntagged with a vendor tag and multiple gold images per test could exist. (This is a todo for later)\n\nIt's also possible to run the audio/graphics tests separately.\n\n\nRuns, mp3, ogg, flag and 24bit .wav test. Use --help for more information.\n```\n  $ cd gamestudio/audio/test\n  $ ./audio_test --mp3 --ogg --flac --24bit\n  $ ...\n  $ ./audio_test --help\n```\n\nRuns all tests with MSAA4. Any test rendering that differs from the expected gold image will stop the program for user input\n(press any key to continue) and will generate a *Delta_* and *Result_* images. The former will help visualize the pixels \nthat were not the same between result and gold and the result will be actual rendering result in whole. \nUse --help for more information.\n```\n  $ cd gamestudio/graphics/test/dist\n  $ ./graphics_test --test --msaa4\n  $ ...\n  $ ./graphics_test --help \n```\n\nCoding Convention & Design\n--------------------------\n- todo: c++ objects that represent classes\n- todo: asserts/logging/exceptions\n- todo: callbacks\n\nTracing & Profiling\n-------------------\nWhat follows is only specific to Linux.

  "readme_contents": "GAMESTUDIO 2D\n===================\n\nA 2D game engine and editor for Linux, Windows and HTML5. Designed for simple single player games such as puzzle games,\nplatformers and side scrollers. Eventually support is planned for tile based games too for real time strategy/tactics.\n\nThis readme and other readme files, are for developers and cover information related to developing and building the engine itself.<br>\nFor end user guide see  [help](editor/dist/help/help.html \"user help\") instead. \n\nOther readmes:\n  * [Audio](audio/README.md \"Audio readme\")\n  * [Graphics](graphics/README.md \"Graphics readme\") (todo)\n  * [Game](game/README.md \"Game readme\") (todo)\n  * [Engine](engine/README.md \"Engine readme\") (todo)\n  * [UI](uikit/README.md \"UIKit readme\") \n  * [WDK](wdk/README.md \"WDK readme\")\n\n![Screenshot](screens/bandit-play.gif \"Bandit demo\")\n\nCurrently supported major features:\n* Qt5 based editor\n* Text rendering\n* Various primitive shapes, custom polygon shapes\n* Material system\n* Particle system\n* Entity system with animation tracks\n* Audio engine\n* Lua based scripting for entities, scenes and game logic\n* Scene builder\n* Styleable UI system \n* Box2D based physics\n* Demo content\n* Game content packaging\n* Window integration (https://github.com/ensisoft/wdk)\n* HTML5/WASM build target support\n\nPlanned major features not yet implemented:\n* tile maps and tile engine\n* partial 3D support for specific objects (think objects such as coins, diamonds, player ship etc.)\n* OpenGL ES3 backend, WebGL2\n\nPlanned minor features not yet implemented:\n* See issues for more details\n\n![Screenshot](screens/editor-animation.png \"Entity editor\")\nCreate your animated game play characters in the entity editor. Each entity can contain an arbitrary render tree\nof nodes with various attachments for physics, rendering and text display. Animation tracks allow changing the properties\nof the nodes and transforming the tree itself over time. Each entity type can then be associated with a Lua script where\nyou can write your entity specific game play code.\n\n![Screenshot](screens/editor-material.png \"Material editor\")\nCreate materials using the material editor by setting some properties for the provided default material shaders.\nCurrently supports sprite animations, textures (including text and noise), gradient and color fills out of box.\nCustom shaders can be used too.\n\n![Screenshot](screens/editor-scene.png \"Scene editor\")\nCreate the game play scenes using the scene editor. The entities you create in the entity editor are available here\nfor placing in the scene. Viewport visualization will quickly show you how much of the game world will be seen when\nthe game plays.\n\n![Screenshot](screens/editor-ui.png \"UI editor\")\nCreate the game's UI in the UI editor. The UI and the widgets can be styled using a JSON based style file and then individual widgets\ncan have their style properties fine tuned in the editor. The style system integrates with the editor's material system too!\n\n![Screenshot](screens/editor-audio.png \"Audio graph editor\")\nCreate audio graphs using the audio editor. Each audio graph can have a number of elements added to it. The graph then\nspecifies the flow of audio PCM data from source elements to processing elements to finally to the graph output. Currently\nsupported audio backends are Waveout on Windows and Pulseaudio on Linux. Supported formats are wav, mp3, ogg and flac.\n\n![Screenshot](screens/editor-script.png \"Script editor\")\nUse the built-in code editor to write the Lua scripts for the entities, scenes or for the game. The editor has a built-in\nhelp system for accessing the engine side Lua API documentation.\n\n![Screenshot](screens/demo-bandit.png \"Editor game play window\")\nDuring the development the game is available for play in the editor. It's possible to do live edits to the\ngame content in the editor and see the changes take place in the play window.\n\nBuild Instructions\n==================\n\nWASM\n------------------------------\nBuilding to WASM currently supported only for the engine but not the editor.\nThe build is separated from the main engine build and is in emscripten/ folder.\n\n- Install emscripten (https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) Note that the\n  location of emsdk is arbitrary, but I've dumped it into gamestudio/ so that my IDE (Clion) can\n  easily find the emscripten headers for C++ tooling (the CMakeLists then has a matching include for this).\n- Currently, the target Emscripten version is 3.0.0. Using other version will likely break things.\n- If using Windows Install Ninja from https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases. Drop the ninja.exe for example\n  into the emsdk folder or anywhere on your PATH.\n\nOn Linux\n\n- Install Emscripten\n```\n  $ cd gamestudio\n  $ git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git\n  $ cd emsdk\n  $ git pull\n  $ ./emsdk install latest\n  $ ./emsdk activate 3.0.0\n  $ source ./emsdk_env.sh\n```\n-- Check your Emscripten installation\n```\n  $ which emcc\n  $ /home/user/emsdk/upstream/emscripten/emcc\n  $ emcc --version\n  $ emcc (Emscripten gcc/clang-like replacement + linker emulating GNU ld) 3.0.0 (3fd52e107187b8a169bb04a02b9f982c8a075205)\n```\n- Build the Gamestudio engine into a WASM blob. Make sure that you have the emscripten tools in your path,\n  i.e. you have sourced emsdk_env.sh in your current shell.\n```\n  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/gamestudio\n  $ cd gamestudio\n  $ git submodule update --init --recursive\n  $ cd emscripten\n  $ mkdir build\n  $ cd build\n  $ emcmake cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\n  $ make -j16 install\n``` \n\nOn Windows\n- Install Emscripten\n```\n  $ cd gamestudio\n  $ git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git\n  $ cd emsdk\n  $ git pull\n  $ emsdk.bat install latest\n  $ emsdk.bat activate 3.0.0\n  $ emsdk_env.bat\n```\n-- Check your Emscripten and Ninja installation\n```\n  $ where emcc\n  $ C:\\coding\\gamestudio\\emsdk\\upstream\\emscripten\\emcc\n  $ C:\\coding\\gamestudio\\emsdk\\upstream\\emscripten\\emcc.bat\n  $ emcc --version\n  $ emcc (Emscripten gcc/clang-like replacement + linker emulating GNU ld) 3.0.0 (3fd52e107187b8a169bb04a02b9f982c8a075205)\n  $ where ninja\n  $ C:\\coding\\gamestudio\\emsdk\\ninja.exe\n  $ ninja --version\n  $ 1.10.2\n```\n- Build the Gamestudio engine into a WASM blob. Make sure you have emcc and ninja in your path i.e. you have\n  ran emsdk_env.bat in your current shell. \n```\n  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/gamestudio\n  $ cd gamestudio\n  $ git submodule update --init --recursive\n  $ cd emscripten\n  $ mkdir build\n  $ cd build\n  $ emcmake cmake .. \n  $ ninja -j8\n  $ ninja -j8 install\n```\n\nIf everything went well there should now be GameEngine.js and GameEngine.wasm files in the editor's dist folder. \nThe .js file contains the JavaScript glue code needed to manhandle the WASM code into the browser's WASM engine\nwhen the web page loads. When a game is packaged for web these files will then be deployed (copied) into the\ngame's output directory.\n\nPenguin Juice (Linux)\n------------------------------\n\n- Install the dev packages.\n  (for Ubuntu based systems)\n```\n  $ sudo apt-get install libboost-dev\n  $ sudo apt-get install qtbase5-dev\n  $ sudo apt-get install libpulse-dev\n```\n- Install Conan build system.\nhttps://docs.conan.io/en/latest/installation.html\n\n- Build the project in RELEASE mode\n```\n  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/gamestudio\n  $ cd gamestudio\n  $ git submodule update --init --recursive\n  $ mkdir build\n  $ cd build\n  $ conan install .. --build missing\n  $ cmake -G \"Unix Makefiles\" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..\n  $ make -j16 install\n  $ ctest -j16\n```\n\n- Build the project in DEBUG mode\n```\n  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/gamestudio\n  $ cd gamestudio\n  $ git submodule update --init --recursive\n  $ mkdir build_d\n  $ cd build_d\n  $ conan install .. --build missing\n  $ cmake -G \"Unix Makefiles\" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..\n  $ make -j16 install\n  $ ctest -j16\n```\n\n- Build the project for profiling using valgrind / kcachegrind\n```\n  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/gamestudio\n  $ cd gamestudio \n  $ git submodule update --init --recursive\n  $ mkdir build_profile\n  $ cd build_profile\n  $ conan install .. --build missing \n  $ cmake -G \"Unix Makefiles\" --DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo\n  $ make -j16 install\n```\nThen in order to profile and analyze the output use the combination of valgrind and kcachegrind.\nFor example:\n```\n  $ cd gamestudio/audio/test/\n  $ valgrind --tool=cachegrind ./audio_test --graph\n  $ kcaghegrind cachegrind.out.XXXXX\n```\n\n\nBoring But Stable (Windows)\n---------------------------------\n\nThese build instructions are for MSVS 2019 Community Edition and for 64bit build.\n\n- Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Community\nhttps://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/\n\n- Install prebuilt Qt 5.15.2\nhttp://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.15/5.15.2/single/qt-everywhere-src-5.15.2.zip\n\n- Install prebuilt Boost 1.72\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.72.0_b1/\n\n- Install conan package manager\nhttps://docs.conan.io/en/latest/installation.html\n\n- Open \"Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019\"\n\nBuild the project in RELEASE mode.\n\n```\n  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/gamestudio\n  $ cd gamestudio\n  $ git submodule update --init --recursive\n  $ mkdir build\n  $ cd build\n  $ conan install .. --build missing\n  $ cmake -G \"Visual Studio 16 2019\" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..\n  $ cmake --build   . --config Release\n  $ cmake --install . --config Release\n```\n\nBuild the project in DEBUG mode. \n\n* Note that on MSVS the library interfaces change between debug/release build configs. (e.g. iterator debug levels). \nThis means that in order to link to 3rd party libraries the debug versions of those libraries must be used.\n\n```\n  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/gamestudio\n  $ cd gamestudio\n  $ git submodule update --init --recursive\n  $ mkdir build_d\n  $ cd build_d\n  $ conan install .. --build missing -s build_type=Debug\n  $ cmake -G \"Visual Studio 16 2019\" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..\n  $ cmake --build   . --config Debug\n  $ cmake --install . --config Debug\n```\n\n\nThe Boring Documentation\n=======================\n\nWorkflow and getting started\n----------------------------\nGoing from a git clone to a running game is known as the \"build workflow\". This involves various steps\ninvolving the source tree of the engine, the source tree of the game, the runtime assets provided with the\nengine and the runtime assets that are part of the game. Overall this will involve several build and packaging steps.\n\nCurrently, only Lua based games are supported. There's a provided game engine that is built into a shared library\nand which contains all the relevant functionality for running a game. That is it will take care of rendering the scene,\nticking the physics engine, handling the UI input as well as invoking the Lua scripts in order to run *your* game code.\nIt's possible to also not use this provided engine but write a completely different engine. In this case the interface\nto implement is the \"Engine\" interface in engine/main/interface.h.\n\nFrom source code to a running game:\n1. Build the whole project as outlined in the **Build Instructions** previously.\n   You will also need to *install* the build targets. Installing not only copies the binaries into the right place\n   but also copies other assets such as GLSL shader files. Without the install step things will not work correctly!\n2. After building launch the Editor from the editor/dist folder.\n3. *In the Editor:* Open your game's workspace folder. This is the folder that contains the workspace.json and content.json files.\n   In Gamestudio this is essentially your \"project\" (It's simply a folder with those two specific files in it).\n4. *In the Editor:* Package your content. (Workspace|Package). Select the assets you want to package (most likely everything).\n   When the packaging process is complete your selected output directory will contain the following:\n   1. The game resources copied over, i.e. shaders, textures, font files etc.\n   2. A content.json file that contains the resource descriptions for your assets that you've built in the editor\n   3. A config.json file that contains the settings for the GameMain to launch the game\n   4. A \"GameMain\" executable and engine library.  These are the default game studio binaries for running your\n      game content after the project has been packaged.\n5. After packaging launch your game by running the GameMain executable in the package output directory.\n\n\nSystem Architecture\n-------------------\n![Archicture diagram](docu/stack.png \"Stack\")\n\nAn overview of the runtime architecture:\n\n1. There's a standard game engine that is built into a shared library called GameEngine.dll or libGameEngine.so.\n2. A launcher application called GameMain will read a config.json file. The JSON file contains information about\n   windowing, context creation etc.\n   1. The launcher application will load the engine library and create an <Engine> object instance.\n   2. The launcher application will create the native window system window and also create the Open GL rendering context\n      which it will then give to the engine instance.\n3. The launcher application will then enter the top-level game loop. Inside the loop it will:\n   1. Process any window system window events to handle pending keyboard/mouse etc. events and pass them to the engine as needed.\n   2. Handle events coming from the engine instance. These could be for example requests to toggle full screen mode.\n   3. Accumulate and track time, call functions to Update, Tick and Draw the app instance.\n\nInside the game engine the following will take place.\n1. The various subsystems are updated and ticked. These include physics, audio, scripting etc.\n2. The renderer is used to draw the current scene.\n3. The engine will handle the input events (mouse, keyboard) coming from the host process and choose the appropriate action.\n   For example If a UI is being shown the input is passed to the UI subsystem. The inputs are then also passed to the\n   game scripting system and ultimately to your game's Lua scripts.\n4. The engine will handle the incoming events/requests from the game itself. For example the game might request a scene\n   to be loaded or the game to be paused.\n\nRunning (Unit) Tests\n--------------------\nThere'a bunch of unit tests that are built as part of the normal build process. Basically anything that begins with\na \"*unit_test_*\" is a unit test. There's a very simple testing utility that is available in base. [test_minimal.h](base/test_minimal.h)  \nIn order to run tests after a successful build:\n\n```\n  $ cd gamestudio/build\n  $ ctest -j16\n```\nCurrently, the expectation is that all cases should pass on Linux. On Windows some of the tests are unfortunately broken.\nIn addition to having the unit tests both the audio and graphics subsystems also have \"rendering\" tests, i.e. playing audio\nor rendering stuff on the screen. The audio systems do not have any automation for checking for correctness. The graphics tests\nwork based on a set of *gold images*. The images are provided as part of this repository but there's the problem that because\nof the differences in OpenGL implementations it's possible that the rendering output is not exactly the same between various\nvendors/implementations (such as NVIDIA, AMD, Intel etc.) This needs to be enhanced so that a set of gold images could be\ntagged with a vendor tag and multiple gold images per test could exist. (This is a todo for later)\n\nIt's also possible to run the audio/graphics tests separately.\n\n\nRuns, mp3, ogg, flag and 24bit .wav test. Use --help for more information.\n```\n  $ cd gamestudio/audio/test\n  $ ./audio_test --mp3 --ogg --flac --24bit\n  $ ...\n  $ ./audio_test --help\n```\n\nRuns all tests with MSAA4. Any test rendering that differs from the expected gold image will stop the program for user input\n(press any key to continue) and will generate a *Delta_* and *Result_* images. The former will help visualize the pixels \nthat were not the same between result and gold and the result will be actual rendering result in whole. \nUse --help for more information.\n```\n  $ cd gamestudio/graphics/test/dist\n  $ ./graphics_test --test --msaa4\n  $ ...\n  $ ./graphics_test --help \n```\n\nCoding Convention & Design\n--------------------------\n- todo: c++ objects that represent classes\n- todo: asserts/logging/exceptions\n- todo: callbacks\n\nTracing & Profiling\n-------------------\nWhat follows is only specific to Linux. I don't know the tools for doing this on Windows.\n\nThe engine has very primitive tracing built in. Most of the top-level subsystem calls to update all subsystems and to render\nthe scene are wrapped inside trace calls. (The macros and tracing facilities can be found in base/trace.h) \n```\n  TRACE_CALL(\"Renderer::BeginFrame\", mRenderer.BeginFrame());\n  TRACE_CALL(\"Renderer::DrawScene\", mRenderer.Draw(*mScene , *mPainter , transform, nullptr, &cull));\n```\n\nThe tracing can be turned on in the GameMain application by providing --trace parameter with a name to the file\nwhere to record the trace. There are 2 formats that are supported. A simple text format and a JSON format that is\ncompatible with Chromium's trace viewer. So for example to trace blast demo one first needs to build the release\npackage of the game (in GSEditor) and then navigate to the that directory and launch the game.\n\n```\n $ ./Blast\\! --trace trace.json\n```\n\nThis should produce a trace.json file which can be loaded in Chrome/Chromium. \n(Open a new tab and open about::tracing and hit the Load button)\n\nThe top most bar of every frame (MainLoop) is the overall frame trace and should not exceed your swap interval.\nIn other words if you're running with VSYNC turned on (see your game's config.json) this should not exceed your \nmaximum frame time which is computed as 1.0 / hz. (Where hz is your display's refresh frequency).\nIn any frame *most* of the time should be spent in Device::Swap given the computational capacity of a modern\ncomputer and GPU and the simplicity of the games in this package.\n\nOverall all frames are composed of the following sequence:\n1. Begin new game loop iteration\n    1. Call engine begin loop\n        1. Call \"begin loop\" on all engine subsystems\n2. Handle events\n   1. Handle window system window events\n   2. Handle engine requests  \n3. Update engine\n   1. All subsystems update\n   2. All subsystems tick (if needed) \n4. Draw\n   1. Renderer draw scene\n   2. Physics draw debug \n   3. UI paint UI\n   4. Draw engine aux stuff, debug messages, mouse\n4. Swap\n5. End game loop iteration\n   1. Call engine end loop\n       1. Call \"end loop\" on all subsystems\n       \n![Trace picture](docu/trace.jpg \"Trace\")\n\nThe tracing allows to quickly get an overview of the frame structure and find out where the frame time is spent. This is ideal\nfor quickly seeing the janky frames and getting some idea what's going on. The hard problem will be then figuring out\nmore details of the part that is going wrong.

E.g.:\n*** your beef tastes better after you put it in the fire\n\nThe goal is to introduce more and more complex mechanics one by one progressively, and try to introduce mechanics such that:\n\n* humans are able to solve the problem\n* the existing AIs were not able to solve the problem\n\nin order to break the AIs and force AI developperes to make smarter AIs that look more like humans.\n\nAIs should then be tested against mechanics that they have not trained against, much like in: http://www.gvgai.net/\n\n== GPU\n\nThe GPU is the most promising computational breakthrough of our time, and might be the first thing that allows us to reach the critical speed / cost point needed for full AI.\n\nWe would like therefore to explore GPU usage for all parts of the simulation / decision making process.\n\nThe game / AI loop is:\n\n1.  update the rigid body physics engine world state (e.g. Bullet Physics supports OpenCL, NVIDIA PhysX)\n+\nThis step can also generate as output some inputs for the game AI, e.g. if the robot touches a wall, a touch sensation input for that part of the robot.\n2.  render scene (with OpenGL GPU, duh)\n3.  do the game AI, that is, simulate the brain of the virtual robot / animal\n+\nInputs:\n* rendered scene (array of pixels) from the renderer\n* touch input from the physics engine\n* other inputs:\n** radio signals / voice from other robots\n** currently held \"non-physical\" symbolic state, like the Minecraft inventory, or the amount of bullets on an FPS\n+\nProcessing method:\n* try to keep everything inside the GPU to avoid CPU round-trip\n** OpenCL / OpenGL bridges for rendered pixels\n** physics engine GPU / OpenCL bridges\n* use custom OpenCL to make the decisions as much as possible\n** many useful libraries now have GPU support, e.g. OpenCV and https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn[NVIDIA cuDNN], https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/visionworks[NVIDIA VisionWorks] on CUDA\n+\nOutputs:\n* forces generated by the robot's motors, to be passed as input to the physics engine\n* other side effects like:\n** radio signals / voice emitted to other peer robots for communication\n** magic \"non-physical\" symbol operation actions, like crafting an item in Minecraft or pulling a trigger on an FPS\n4.  to back to step 1\n\n== Game mechanic\n\nGood game concepts should both:\n\n* mimic key aspects of simple real robots / animals, which can hopefully be generalized to \"real\" reality:\n** first person with perspective, possibly 2D to simplify as in http://blog.otoro.net/2015/05/07/creatures-avoiding-planks/\n** goals similar to those of real animals: eat, don't get eaten, find resources\n** mix a physical simulation engine with purely symbolic information that skips the rigid body simulator.\n*** bullets in real life are physical, but in FPS games they are just one integer.\n*** Minecraft raw materials are interesting, as they bridge the voxel physics engine and symbolic information: when you mine, you take a voxel from the physics engine, and change a symbol on your inventory\n* simplify the real world\n** we don't have enough computational power yet for reality\n** we don't know good AI algorithms yet, start with simpler problems first\n* voxel or vector:\n** the real world is actually voxel, which is tempting\n** however, voxels are expensive to compute, therefore practical games we've seen so far:\n*** have voxels at least as large as the player. But 50% of our daily thinking is about things smaller than ourselves, e.g. food.\n*** have very limited voxel dynamics, e.g. no rotations\n\nMechanics ideas:\n\n* extract discrete concepts from continuous data.\n+\nYou notice that some pixels always move together. So you interpret them as being one single \"object\", a discrete concept in your mind.\n+\nPossibly partition tasks as:\n** CPU: symbolic manipulation tasks\n** GPU: continuous data tasks\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_permanence\n+\nYou are a starving predator and you see a single prey turning around a corner.\n+\nThe robot should have memory that he is chasing this single prey, and some type of understanding that things disappear from sight around corners, and then turn the corner as well.\n* discrete consequences to continuous action. E.g.: you touch a red wall: then a blue gate opens.\n* topology:\n** two preys go into a closed cave. I enter and eat 2 preys. So then I should go out to find more.\n** I see a prey through a hole in the wall. The hole is too small for me to get in. So I must find another way.\n** I construct a closed barrier around me. Predators cannot eat me! (Minecraft home building)\n* current tool mechanic: the robot has a current tool + a single actuator for it. Like switching weapons on Minecraft / FPS.\n* thinking like someone else: if prey sees me, it runs away. So I find a way to approach without being seen.\n* recognizing places: there is lots of food around the place with two trees. So I hang out around that place more often than others.\n\nEvil ideas:\n\n* invisible objects. E.g.: Mario hidden blocks. Possibly controlled by agents, like camouflage in nature, or spy in Team Fortress.\n* objects that look like other objects. E.g. a prey that looks like predator. Mimicry in nature: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry Possibly via metamorphosis.\n* two objects that look the same, but act very differently. Agent then has to identify which one it is.\n\n== Literature\n\nExisting research in the area.\n\n* https://gym.openai.com most interesting set of hand made games I've seen so far since 2D focus, but no 2D Minecraft yet\n** https://github.com/rll/rllab TODO what value does it add on top of Gym?\n** https://github.com/openai/roboschool bullet based robotics simulation environment\n** https://openai.com/blog/emergent-tool-use/ 2019-09 hide-and-seek game.

  "readme_contents": "# vgmstream\nThis is vgmstream, a library for playing streamed (prerecorded) video game audio.\n\nSome of vgmstream's features:\n- [Hundreds of video game music formats and codecs](doc/FORMATS.md), from typical game engine files\n  to obscure single-game codecs, aiming for high accuracy and compatibility.\n- Support for looped BGM, using file's internal metadata for smooth transitions, with accurate\n  sample counts.\n- [Subsongs](doc/USAGE.md#subsongs), playing a format's multiple internal songs separately.\n- Many types of companion files (data split into multiple files) and custom containers.\n- Encryption keys, internal stream names, and many other unusual cases found in game audio.\n- [TXTH](doc/TXTH.md) function, to add external support for extra formats, including raw audio in\n  many forms.\n- [TXTP](doc/TXTP.md) function, for real-time and per-file config, like forced looping, removing\n  channels, playing certain subsong, or fusing multiple files into a single one.\n- Simple [external tagging](doc/USAGE.md#tagging) via .m3u files.\n- [Plugins](#getting-vgmstream) are available for various media player software and operating systems.\n\nThe main development repository: https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/\n\nAutomated builds with the latest changes: https://vgmstream.org/downloads\n\nCommon releases: https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/releases\n\nHelp can be found here: https://www.hcs64.com/\n\nMore documentation: https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/tree/master/doc\n\n## Getting vgmstream\nThere are multiple end-user components:\n- [test.exe/vgmstream-cli](doc/USAGE.md#testexevgmstream-cli-command-line-decoder): A command-line decoder.\n- [in_vgmstream](doc/USAGE.md#in_vgmstream-winamp-plugin): A Winamp plugin.\n- [foo_input_vgmstream](doc/USAGE.md#foo_input_vgmstream-foobar2000-plugin): A foobar2000 component.\n- [xmp-vgmstream](doc/USAGE.md#xmp-vgmstream-xmplay-plugin): An XMPlay plugin.\n- [vgmstream.so](doc/USAGE.md#audacious-plugin): An Audacious plugin.\n- [vgmstream123](doc/USAGE.md#vgmstream123-command-line-player): A command-line player.\n\nThe main library (plain *vgmstream*) is the code that handles the internal conversion, while the\nabove components are what you use to get sound.\n\nIf you just want to convert game audio to `.wav`, easiest would be getting *test.exe/vgmstream-cli* (see\nbelow) then drag-and-drop one or more files to the executable. This should create `(file.extension).wav`,\nif the format is supported. More usable would be installing a music player like *foobar2000* (for\nWindows) or *Audacious* (for Linux) then the appropriate component, so you can listen to VGM without\nconverting and set options like infinite looping.\n\nSee [components](doc/USAGE.md#components) in the *usage guide* for full install instructions and\nexplanations. The aim is feature parity, but there are a few differences between them due to\nmissing implementation on vgmstream's side or lack of support in target player or API.\n\nNote vgmstream cannot *encode* (convert from `.wav` to some video game format), it only *decodes*\n(plays game audio).\n\n\n### Windows\nYou should get `vgmstream-win.zip`, which also bundles various components, or\n`foo_input_vgmstream.fb2k-component` for the installable foobar2000 plugin from the\nlatest prebuilt binaries on our website:\n- https://vgmstream.org/downloads\n\nYou can also get them from the less frequently updated releases on GitHub:\n- https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/releases\n\nIf the above links fail, you may also try the alternative, somewhat recent versions built by\n[bnnm](https://github.com/bnnm):\n- https://github.com/bnnm/vgmstream-builds/raw/master/bin/vgmstream-latest-test-u.zip\n\nIf you prefer, you may compile the components from source as well, see the\n[build guide](doc/BUILD.md) for more information.\n\n### Linux\nFor convenience, releases distribute a command-line decoder in `vgmstream-cli.zip`. It is\nstatically linked and should work on all systems running Linux kernel v3.2 and above.\n- https://vgmstream.org/downloads\n- https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/releases\n\nBuilding from source will also give you *vgmstream.so*, an Audacious plugin, and *vgmstream123*,\na command-line player.\n\nWhen building from source code, many components have to be installed or compiled separately. The\n[build guide](doc/BUILD.md) describes this process in more detail. For a quick build on Debian and\nUbuntu-style distributions, run `./make-build-cmake.sh`. The script will be installing various\ndependencies, so you may prefer to copy the commands from the file and run them one by one.\n\n### macOS\nPlease follow the [build guide](doc/BUILD.md).\n\n\n## More info\n- [Usage guide](doc/USAGE.md)\n- [List of supported audio formats](doc/FORMATS.md)\n- [Build guide](doc/BUILD.md)\n- [TXTH file format](doc/TXTH.md)\n- [TXTP file format](doc/TXTP.md)\n\n\nEnjoy! *hcs*\n"

  "language": "C++",
  "readme_contents": "## libTAS\n\nGNU/Linux software to give TAS tools to games. Code orginates from [SuperMeatBoyTaser](https://github.com/DeathlyDeep/SuperMeatBoyTaser). It requires a GNU/Linux system with a recent kernel (at least 3.17 for the `memfd_create` syscall). Supported archs are `x86_64` and `x86`. You will need the Mesa llvm OpenGL driver to support savestates for games using OpenGL.\n\nDiscord server: https://discord.gg/3MBVAzU\n\nWebsite: https://clementgallet.github.io/libTAS/ (still in progress)\n\nAdditional documentation on tasvideos.org: https://tasvideos.org/EmulatorResources/LibTAS.html\n\n## Supported Games\n\nInitial work was done to support games using the SDL library (which is the case of many indie games), but other engines are supported now.\n\nBy default, you should look for a drm-free version of the game. Games installed through Steam may or may not work. Some Steam games are in fact drm-free, they work without Steam running, or they just need some simple operations. For the other games, there is a \"Virtual Steam client\" setting in libTAS which implements a dummy Steam client, but it doesn't support every game. Of course, all of this only applies to games that don't have any active protection measure. For more details, check the [Game Compatibility](https://tasvideos.org/EmulatorResources/LibTAS/GameCompatibility) page.\n\nThere is also initial support for Windows games through wine. Details are given below.\n\n## Non-linux users\n\nIf you don't have a Linux system beforehand, there are several options that you can choose:\n- Run libTAS using [WSL 2](https://clementgallet.github.io/libTAS/guides/wsl/) (Windows Subsystem for Linux) (preferred option)\n- Install a Linux container with Docker (described below)\n- Install Linux on a virtual machine. Grab a virtualization software (e.g. VirtualBox) and a Linux distribution (e.g. Ubuntu). If you have a 64-bit computer, install a 64-bit Linux distribution, which will allow you to run both 32-bit and 64-bit games. Note for Ubuntu users that you need a recent version (17.10 minimum).\n\n## Install\n\nYou can download the latest stable version of the software in the [Releases](https://github.com/clementgallet/libTAS/releases) page. The current dependencies are:\n\n* `libc6`, `libgcc1`, `libstdc++6`\n* `libqt5core5a`, `libqt5gui5`, `libqt5widgets5` with Qt version at least 5.6\n* `libx11-6`, `libxcb1`, `libxcb-keysyms1`, `libxcb-xkb1`, `libxcb-cursor0`\n* `liblua5.4-0` or `liblua5.3-0`\n* `ffmpeg`\n* `file`\n* `libswresample2` or `libswresample3`, `libasound2`\n* `libfontconfig1`, `libfreetype6`\n\nInstalling with the debian package will install all the required packages as well.\n\nThere is also an [automated build](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/clementgallet/libtas/build/artifacts) available for the last interim version, 64-bit with dual-arch.\n\n## Building\n\nAn PKGBUILD is available for Arch Linux on the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libtas/).\n\n### Dependencies\n\nYou will need to download and install the following to build libTAS:\n\n* Deb: `apt-get install build-essential automake pkg-config libx11-dev libx11-xcb-dev qtbase5-dev qt5-default libsdl2-dev libxcb1-dev libxcb-keysyms1-dev libxcb-xkb-dev libxcb-cursor-dev libxcb-randr0-dev libudev-dev liblua5.4-dev libasound2-dev libavutil-dev libswresample-dev ffmpeg`\n* Arch: `pacman -S base-devel automake pkgconf qt5-base xcb-util-cursor alsa-lib lua ffmpeg sdl2`\n\nTo enable HUD on the game screen, you will also need:\n\n* Deb: `apt-get install libfreetype6-dev libfontconfig1-dev`\n* Arch: `pacman -S fontconfig freetype2`\n\n### Cloning\n\n    git clone https://github.com/clementgallet/libTAS.git\n    cd libTAS\n\n### Building\n\n    ./build.sh\n\nautoconf will detect the presence of these libraries and disable the corresponding features if necessary.\nIf you want to manually enable/disable a feature, you must add at the end of the `build.sh` command:\n\n- `--disable-hud`: enable/disable displaying informations on the game screen\n\nBe careful that you must compile your code in the same arch as the game. If you have an amd64 system and you only have access to a i386 game, you can cross-compile the code to i386 (see below).\n\n### Install\n\n    sudo make install\n\n### Dual-arch\n\nIf you have an amd64 system and you want to run both i386 or amd64 games, you can install libTAS 32-bit library together with the amd64 build. To do that, you can build using `./build.sh --with-i386`, which will produce an additional `libtas32.so` (32-bit) library together with amd64 builds of `libTAS` GUI and `libtas.so` library.\n\nYou will need the 32-bit version of libraries `libX11`, `libX11-xcb`, `libasound`, `libavutil`, `libswresample`, the 32-bit version of the headers for `libavutil`, `libswresample`, and also librairies `libfreetype` and `libfontconfig` for the HUD feature. You will also need your compiler to be able to cross-compile, by installing `g++-multilib` if using g++ compiler. When running a game, libTAS will choose automatically the right `libtas.so` library based on the game arch.\n\n* Deb: `apt-get install libx11-6:i386 libx11-xcb1:i386 libasound2:i386 libavutil56:i386 libavutil-dev:i386 libswresample-dev:i386 libswresample3:i386 libfreetype6:i386 libfontconfig1:i386`\n\n## Run\n\nTo run this program, you can use the program shortcut in your system menu, or open a terminal and enter:\n\n    libTAS [game_executable_path [game_cmdline_arguments]]\n\nYou can type `libTAS -h` to have a description of the program options.\n\nThe program prompts a graphical user interface where you can start the game or change several options. Details of the different options are available [here](https://tasvideos.org/EmulatorResources/LibTAS/MenuOptions)\n\nThere are a few things to take care before being able to run a game. You might want to look at the software [usage](https://tasvideos.org/EmulatorResources/LibTAS/Usage).\n\nHere are the default controls when the game has started:\n\n- frame advancing, using the `V` key\n- pause/play, using the `pause` key\n- fast forward, using the `tab` key\n\nNote: the game starts up **paused**.\n\n## Run Windows games through wine\n\nThis is still experimental. To launch Windows games through wine, you first need to install wine on your system (it must be located somewhere in $PATH).\n\nTo get audio correctly handled, you need to open winetricks, then select \"Select the default wineprefix\", \"Change settings\" and check \"sound=alsa\".\n\nIn the game executable field, you must set the Windows `.exe` executable (both 32-bit and 64-bit are supported, given that you have the wine version for it). It will detect a Windows executable and launch wine with the right options.\n\nThere are still a lot of issues to fix:\n- \"Prevent writing to disk\" feature does not work, because wine delegating to another process (wine server) the file handling (#250)\n- Window focus/unfocus doesn't work sometimes and you cannot move the game window (#262). Try alt-tabbing until you get it back\n- \"Virtual Steam client\" does not work, because we don't hook the loading of the `steam_api.dll` file (#264)\n- Window repainting (Expose event) does not work, so if you pause the game and drag another window in front of it, it will overwrite what is displayed by the game\n\n## Run on Windows using Docker\n\nOne option if you have a Windows system is to run a Linux distribution inside a Docker container. This has the advantage of automating package installation and libTAS compilation. On Windows there are currently two possibilities for using Docker: [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows) and [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/). There are some requirements for the former (Windows 10 64-bit Pro, Enterprise, or Education), so I will describe the installation process for the later (both should be really close, but I can't test the former).\n\n### Install\n\n- install [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/)\n- download the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/clementgallet/libTAS/blob/master/Dockerfile) somewhere (don't rename the file!).\n- open Docker Quickstart Terminal, and run the command `docker build -t libtas /c/path/to/Dockerfile/directory`. The path points to the directory containing the Dockerfile, not to the Dockerfile itself. Also, this terminal takes paths in Unix syntax: `C:\\foo\\bar` becomes `/c/foo/bar`. The Docker container build should start.\n- prepare a directory that will contain your games. This directory must be somewhere inside `C:/Users/`, because it is shared by default by Virtualbox. If you want to share another folder, you can follow this [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210301191513/https://support.divio.com/en/articles/646695-how-to-use-a-directory-outside-c-users-with-docker-toolbox-docker-for-windows)\n- you need a X11 server to be able to display applications from the Linux container. Install [vcxsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/)\n\n### Run\n\n- launch Xlaunch, and check \"Disable access control\" in the Extra settings\n- for the Linux container to find your X11 server, you need your ip address. Type `ipconfig` in the Docker terminal, and search for ipv4 field.\n- to launch the container, run:\n\n```\ndocker run -ti --rm -e DISPLAY=\"<ip>:0.0\" -v /c/Users/path/to/shared/folder:/root/games libtas\n```\n\nYou need to use the Unix syntax again for your shared folder path. Relative paths don't work here.\n\nThis should open a terminal in your container. You can then enter `libTAS` to launch the program. If everything goes right, you should see the libtas window appear. If it complains about not been able to open the display, check again your ipv4 field. You can also access to your shared files located inside `/root/games` path. Because of how Docker works, everything that is modified outside of `/root/games` will not be preserved on later instances of the container, so be sure to install and save everything inside that directory.\n\nTODO: Figure out how to use Mesa OpenGL.\n\n## Run on Linux using Docker\n\n### Install\n\n- install docker through your usual package manager\n- you may want to use docker as a non-root user. To do that, create the docker group: `sudo groupadd docker` and add the user to the group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER` \n- download the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/clementgallet/libTAS/blob/master/Dockerfile) somewhere (don't rename the file!).\n- run the command `docker build -t libtas /path/to/Dockerfile/directory`. The path points to the directory containing the Dockerfile, not to the Dockerfile itself. The Docker container build should start.\n\n### Run\n\n- to launch the container, run:\n\n```\ndocker run --net=host -ti --rm -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v \"$XAUTHORITY:/root/.Xauthority:rw\" -e DISPLAY libtas\n```\n\nThis should open a terminal in your container. You can then enter `libTAS` to launch the program. If everything goes right, you should see the libtas window appear. If you want to access to your local files, you can add `-v $HOME:/home` in the command options to map your $HOME directory to `/home`. Because of how Docker works, everything that is modified outside of this directory will not be preserved on later instances of the container.\n\n## Logo\n\nMade by brunovalads.\n\n## License\n\nlibTAS is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License v3.\n\n    Copyright (C) 2016-2018 clementgallet\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

TAG provides a common skeleton for implementing tabletop games based on a common API for AI agents, a set of components and classes to easily add new games and an import module for defining data in JSON format. At present, this platform includes the implementation of seven different tabletop games that can also be used as an example for further developments. Additionally, TAG also incorporates logging functionality that allows the user to perform a detailed analysis of the game, in terms of action space, branching factor, hidden information, and other measures of interest for Game AI research.\n![Pandemic](data/imgs/Pandemic.png)\n*Example GUI for Pandemic*\n\n## Games\nCurrently implemented games:\n- [x] Tic-Tac-Toe\n- [x] Dots and Boxes\n- [x] Love Letter (Seiji Kanai 2012)\n- [x] Uno (Merle Robbins 1971)\n- [x] Virus!

In order to run the code, you must either download the repository, or clone it. If you are looking for a particular release, you can find all listed [here](https://github.com/GAIGResearch/TabletopGames/releases). \n\nThe simplest way to run the code is to create a new project in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or a similar IDE. In IntelliJ, create a new project from existing sources, pointing to the code downloaded or cloned and selecting the **Maven** framework for import. This process should automatically set up the environment and add any project libraries as well.\n\nAlternatively, open the code directly in your IDE of choice, right click the pom.xml file and setup the project with the Maven framework. Make sure src/main/java is marked as sources root. You can run the `core.Game.java` class to test if all is set up properly and compiling. [This video](https://youtu.be/-U7SCGNOcsg) includes the steps of loading the project correctly in IntelliJ.\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo get started the [website](http://tabletopgames.ai) provides various guides and descriptions of the framework.\nAnother good resource is our paper [\"Design and Implementation of TAG: A Tabletop Games Framework\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12065).\n\n## Citing Information\n\nTo cite TAG in your work, please cite this paper:\n```\n@inproceedings{gaina2020tag,\n         author= {Raluca D.

In recent years, their complexity has considerably increased, with many components, rules that change dynamically through the game, diverse player roles, and a series of control parameters that influence a game's balance. As such, they also encompass novel and intricate challenges for Artificial Intelligence methods, yet research largely focuses on classical board games such as chess and Go. We introduce in this work the Tabletop Games (TAG) framework, which promotes research into general AI in modern tabletop games, facilitating the implementation of new games and AI players, while providing analytics to capture the complexities of the challenges proposed. We include preliminary results with sample AI players, showing some moderate success, with plenty of room for improvement, and discuss further developments and new research directions.},\n    }\n```\n\n## Other Materials\n\n### Visual materials\nV1 \u2013 Edited programming video (see below)<br/>\nV2 \u2013 Uncut programming video (see below)<br/>\nV3 \u2013 PowerPoint slides: https://tinyurl.com/tag-exag-ppt <br/>\nV5 \u2013 Transcript A1: https://tinyurl.com/tag-exag-tr1 <br/>\nV6 \u2013 Transcript A2: https://tinyurl.com/tag-exag-tr2 <br/>\n\n### Audio materials\nA1 \u2013 Framework presentation (see below)<br/>\nA2 \u2013 Programming (see below)<br/>\n\n### Full videos available\nEXAG 2020 presentation (A1 + V1): https://youtu.be/M81elk-NmKM<br/>\nEXAG alternative presentation (A1 + V3): https://youtu.be/ST_2Q40pzjc<br/>\nTAG introduction tutorial (A2 + V1): https://youtu.be/-U7SCGNOcsg<br/>\nTAG full programming tutorial (V2): https://youtu.be/m7DAFdViywY <br/>\n\n## Contact\nThe main method to contribute to our repository directly with code, or to suggest new features, point out bugs or ask questions about the project is through [creating new Issues on this github repository](https://github.com/GAIGResearch/TabletopGames/issues) or [creating new Pull Requests](https://github.com/GAIGResearch/TabletopGames/pulls).

Download the [`UnityExplorer.Editor`](https://github.com/sinai-dev/UnityExplorer/releases/latest/download/UnityExplorer.Editor.zip) release.\n2. Install the package, either by using the Package Manager and importing the `package.json` file, or by manually dragging the folder into your `Assets` folder.\n3. Drag the `Runtime/UnityExplorer` prefab into your scene, or create a GameObject and add the `Explorer Editor Behaviour` script to it.\n\n# Common issues and solutions\n\nAlthough UnityExplorer should work out of the box for most Unity games, in some cases you may need to tweak the settings for it to work properly.\n\nTo adjust the settings, open the config file:\n* BepInEx: `BepInEx\\config\\com.sinai.unityexplorer.cfg`\n* MelonLoader: `UserData\\MelonPreferences.cfg`\n* Standalone: `sinai-dev-UnityExplorer\\config.cfg`\n\nTry adjusting the following settings and see if it fixes your issues:\n* `Startup_Delay_Time` - increase to 5-10 seconds (or more as needed), can fix issues with UnityExplorer being destroyed or corrupted during startup.\n* `Disable_EventSystem_Override` - if input is not working properly, try setting this to `true`.\n\nIf these fixes do not work, please create an issue in this repo and I'll do my best to look into it.\n\n# Features\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sinai-dev/UnityExplorer/master/img/preview.png\">\n    <img src=\"img/preview.png\" />\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n### Inspector API\n\nIf you want to inspect an object or Type from outside the C# console, use the `InspectorManager` class:\n\n**To inspect an object:**\n```csharp\nUnityExplorer.InspectorManager.Inspect(theObject);\n```\n\n**To inspect a Type:**\n```cs\nUnityExplorer.InspectorManager.Inspect(typeof(SomeClass));\n```\n\n### Object Explorer\n\n* Use the <b>Scene Explorer</b> tab to traverse the active scenes, as well as the DontDestroyOnLoad and HideAndDontSave objects.\n  * The \"HideAndDontSave\" scene contains objects with that flag, as well as Assets and Resources which are not in any scene but behave the same way.\n  * You can use the Scene Loader to easily load any of the scenes in the build (may not work for Unity 5.X games)\n* Use the <b>Object Search</b> tab to search for Unity objects (including GameObjects, Components, etc), C# Singletons or Static Classes.\n  * Use the UnityObject search to look for any objects which derive from `UnityEngine.Object`, with optional filters\n  * The singleton search will look for any classes with a typical \"Instance\" field, and check it for a current value. This may cause unexpected behaviour in some IL2CPP games as we cannot distinguish between true properties and field-properties, so some property accessors will be invoked.\n\n### Inspector\n\nThe inspector is used to see detailed information on objects of any type and manipulate their values, as well as to inspect C# Classes with static reflection.\n\n* The <b>GameObject Inspector</b> (tab prefix `[G]`) is used to inspect a `GameObject`, and to see and manipulate its Transform and Components.\n  * You can edit any of the input fields in the inspector (excluding readonly fields) and press <b>Enter</b> to apply your changes. You can also do this to the GameObject path as a way to change the GameObject's parent. Press the <b>Escape</b> key to cancel your edits.\n  * <i>note: When inspecting a GameObject with a Canvas, the transform controls may be overridden by the RectTransform anchors.</i>\n* The <b>Reflection Inspectors</b> (tab prefix `[R]` and `[S]`) are used for everything else\n  * Automatic updating is not enabled by default, and you must press Apply for any changes you make to take effect.\n  * Press the `\u25bc` button to expand certain values such as strings, enums, lists, dictionaries, some structs, etc\n  * Use the filters at the top to quickly find the members you are looking for\n  * For `Texture2D`, `Image`, `Sprite` and `Material` objects, there is a `View Texture` button at the top of the inspector which lets you view the Texture(s) and save them as a PNG file. \n  * For `AudioClip` objects there is a `Show Player` button which opens an audio player widget. For clips which are loaded as `DecompressOnLoad`, there is also a button to save them to a `.wav` file. \n\n### C# Console\n\n* The C# Console uses the `Mono.CSharp.Evaluator` to define temporary classes or run immediate REPL code.\n* You can execute a script automatically on startup by naming it `startup.cs` and placing it in the `sinai-dev-UnityExplorer\\Scripts\\` folder (this folder will be created where you placed the DLL file).\n* See the \"Help\" dropdown in the C# console menu for more detailed information.\n\n### Hook Manager\n\n* The Hooks panel allows you to hook methods at the click of a button for debugging purposes.\n  * Simply enter any class and hook the methods you want from the menu. \n  * You can edit the source code of the generated hook with the \"Edit Hook Source\" button. Accepted method names are `Prefix` (which can return `bool` or `void`), `Postfix`, `Finalizer` (which can return `Exception` or `void`), and `Transpiler` (which must return `IEnumerable<HarmonyLib.CodeInstruction>`). You can define multiple patches if you wish.\n\n### Mouse-Inspect\n\n* The \"Mouse Inspect\" dropdown in the \"Inspector\" panel allows you to inspect objects under the mouse.\n  * <b>World</b>: uses Physics.Raycast to look for Colliders\n  * <b>UI</b>: uses GraphicRaycasters to find UI objects\n\n### Freecam\n\n* UnityExplorer provides a basic Free Camera which you can control with your keyboard and mouse.\n* Unlike all other features of UnityExplorer, you can still use Freecam while UnityExplorer's menu is hidden.\n* Supports using the game's main Camera or a separate custom Camera.\n* See the Freecam panel for further instructions and details.\n\n### Clipboard\n\n* The \"Clipboard\" panel allows you to see your current paste value, or clear it (resets it to `null`)\n  * Can copy the value from any member in a Reflection Inspector, Enumerable or Dictionary, and from the target of any Inspector tab\n  * Can paste values onto any member in a Reflection Inspector\n  * Non-parsable arguments in Method/Property Evaluators allow pasting values\n  * The C# Console has helper methods `Copy(obj)` and `Paste()` for accessing the Clipboard\n\n### Settings\n\n* You can change the settings via the \"Options\" tab of the menu, or directly from the config file.\n  * BepInEx: `BepInEx\\config\\com.sinai.unityexplorer.cfg`\n  * MelonLoader: `UserData\\MelonPreferences.cfg`\n  * Standalone `{DLL_location}\\sinai-dev-UnityExplorer\\config.cfg`\n\n# Building\n\n1. Run the `build.ps1` powershell script to build UnityExplorer. Releases are found in the `Release` folder.\n\nBuilding individual configurations from your IDE is fine, though note that the intial build process builds into `Release/<version>/...` instead of the subfolders that the powershell script uses. Batch building is not currently supported with the project.\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\n* [ManlyMarco](https://github.com/ManlyMarco) for [Runtime Unity Editor](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/RuntimeUnityEditor) \\[[license](THIRDPARTY_LICENSES.md#runtimeunityeditor-license)\\], the ScriptEvaluator from RUE's REPL console was used as the base for UnityExplorer's C# console.\n* [Geoffrey Horsington](https://github.com/ghorsington) for [mcs-unity](https://github.com/sinai-dev/mcs-unity) \\[no license\\], used as the `Mono.CSharp` reference for the C# Console.\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nUnityExplorer is in no way associated with Unity Technologies. \"Unity\", Unity logos, and other Unity trademarks are trademarks or registered trademarks of Unity Technologies or its affiliates in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n"

Typically, a matching game is defined by two sets of players that each have\npreferences over at least some of the elements of the other set. The objective\nof the game is then to find a mapping between the sets of players in which\neveryone is happy enough with their match.\n\nIn Matching, we deal with four types of matching game:\n\n- the stable marriage problem (SM);\n- the hospital-resident assignment problem (HR);\n- the student-allocation problem (SA);\n- the stable roommates problem (SR).\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nMatching requires Python 3.5 or above, and relies only on `NumPy\n<http://www.numpy.org/>`_ for general use.\n\nThe library is most easily installed using :code:`pip`::\n\n    $ python -m pip install matching\n\nHowever, if you would like to install it from source then go ahead and clone the\nGitHub repo::\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/daffidwilde/matching.git\n    $ cd matching\n    $ python setup.py install\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nFull documentation (including tutorials and discussion material) is available\nhere: `<https://matching.readthedocs.io>`_\n\nAn academic paper on this library has been included in the Journal of Open\nSource Software (JOSS) and is available here:\n`<https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02169>`_\n\nPlaying a simple game\n---------------------\n\nWith all games, Matching uses a ``Player`` class to represent the members of the\n\"applying\" party, i.e. residents and students. For HR and SA, there are specific\nclasses to represent the roles of ``Hospital``, ``Project`` and ``Supervisor``.\n\nConsider the following instance of SM which is represented on a bipartite graph\nwhere the suitors and reviewers are along the left and right respectively.\n\n.. image:: ./tex/stable_marriage.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 10cm\n\nWe can construct these preferences using dictionaries:\n\n>>> suitor_preferences = {\n...     \"A\": [\"D\", \"E\", \"F\"], \"B\": [\"D\", \"F\", \"E\"], \"C\": [\"F\", \"D\", \"E\"]\n... }\n>>> reviewer_preferences = {\n...     \"D\": [\"B\", \"C\", \"A\"], \"E\": [\"A\", \"C\", \"B\"], \"F\": [\"C\", \"B\", \"A\"]\n... }\n\nThen to solve this matching game, we make use of the ``StableMarriage`` class,\nlike so:\n\n>>> from matching.games import StableMarriage\n>>> game = StableMarriage.create_from_dictionaries(\n...     suitor_preferences, reviewer_preferences\n... )\n>>> game.solve()\n{A: E, B: D, C: F}\n\n\nThe ``Matching`` object\n+++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nThis matching is not a standard Python dictionary, though it does largely look\nand behave like one. It is in fact an instance of the ``SingleMatching`` class:\n\n>>> matching = game.matching\n>>> type(matching)\n<class 'matching.matchings.SingleMatching'>\n\nThis dictionary-like object is primarily useful as a teaching device that eases\nthe process of manipulating a matching after a solution has been found. \n\n\n``Player`` classes\n++++++++++++++++++\n\nDespite passing dictionaries of strings here, the matching displays instances of\n``matching.player.Player``:\n\n>>> matching = game.matching\n>>> for suitor in matching:\n...     print(type(suitor))\n<class 'matching.players.player.Player'>\n<class 'matching.players.player.Player'>\n<class 'matching.players.player.Player'>\n\nThis is because ``create_from_dictionaries`` creates instances of the\nappropriate player classes first and passes them to the game class. Using\ndictionaries like this can be an efficient way of creating large games but it\ndoes require the names of the players in each party to be unique.\n\nWith all games, Matching uses a ``Player`` class to represent the members of the\n\"applying\" party, i.e. residents and students. For HR and SA, there are specific\nclasses to represent the roles of ``Hospital``, ``Project`` and ``Supervisor``.\n\n\nA note on performance\n---------------------\n\nOne of the limitations of this library is the time complexities of the algorithm\nimplementations. In practical terms, the running time of any of the algorithms\nin Matching is negligible but the theoretic complexity of each has not yet been\nattained. For example, an instance of HR with 400 applicants and 20 hospitals is\nsolved in less than one tenth of a second:\n\n>>> from matching.games import HospitalResident\n>>> import numpy as np\n>>> np.random.seed(0)\n>>> num_residents, num_hospitals = 400, 20\n>>> resident_prefs = {\n...     r: np.argsort(np.random.random(size=num_hospitals))\n...     for r in range(num_residents)\n... }\n>>> hospital_prefs = {\n...     h: np.argsort(np.random.random(size=num_residents))\n...     for h in range(num_hospitals)\n... }\n>>> capacities = {h: num_hospitals for h in hospital_prefs}\n>>> game = HospitalResident.create_from_dictionaries(\n...     resident_prefs, hospital_prefs, capacities\n... )\n>>> _ = game.solve() # 48.6 ms \u00b1 963 \u00b5s per loop\n\n\nGet in contact!\n---------------\n\nI hope this package is useful, and feel free to contact me here (or on Twitter:\n`@daffidwilde <https://twitter.com/daffidwilde>`_) with any issues or\nrecommendations. Pull requests are always welcome!\n"

For those times, this project (requires Java8 or higher). \n\nThe project consists of two packages:\n* <b>org.asl.socketserver</b> which contains the server framework\n* <b>org.asl.socketserver.games</b> which contains sample games\n\nGame classes written for this project should abide by the following four guidelines:\n* provide a default constructor (to permit no-arg instantiation inside a thread)\n* implement the Servable interface (thread life is bounded by Servable.serve())\n* extend AbstractGame (to enable setting/retrieving best score data)\n* annotate the class with a @MenuInfo annotation (provides content for menus)  \n\nCompiled class files meeting these criteria and stored in the org/asl/socketserver/games folder will be identified automatically by the server and made available for play. \n\nA running server may be accessed from a remote shell or terminal using netcat, telnet, etc. For example: \n* <b>netcat localhost 9090</b> // connect to a server running on the same machine using port 9090  \n* <b>netcat 10.30.5.46 4187</b> // connect to a remote server at address 10.30.4.46 over port 4187\n* // the port number specified by the client must match the port number used when starting the server\n\n## Documentation\nCompiled Javadoc for the project is available here: https://apcsjava.github.io/SocketGames/\n\n\n## Notes for compiling and running inside an IDE (Eclipse, say)\nThe main application class is GameServer.  It requires two command line arguments -- the port number and the maximum number of connections to accept.  In Eclipse, go to \"Run Configurations ...\" and under the Arguments tab, enter \"9090 5\", for example, to run the server on port 9090 and accept a maximum of 5 simultaneous connections.\n\n## Notes for compiling and running outside of an IDE (command line)\nThe server must be compiled before it can be run.  If you are compiling from the root folder of the distribution, this will take a form such as: \n* <b> javac org/asl/socketserver/GameServer.java</b>.  \nThis will compile not only the server but all related and dependent classes in the org.asl.socketserver package. \n\nTo compile all classes in the games folder:\n* <b> javac org/asl/socketserver/games/*.java</b>\n\nLaunch the compiled server as follows:\n* <b>java org/asl/socketserver/GameServer 9090 5</b> \n// launches the server on port 9090 and accepts up to 5 simultaneous connections\n* <b>java org/asl/socketserver/GameServer</b> \n// launches the server on an arbitrary, open port (check System.out for details) with a capacity of 10 users.\n\n"

  "readme_contents": "# About This Repository\r\n\r\nThis repository should now be considered a historical curiosity only.\r\n\r\nThe original version of this code was developed between 2002-2004 and included free with the book \"Artificial Intelligence for Games\". Over the intervening years, the code has become a less useful reference. The third edition of the textbook is considerably larger, and this code did not keep up with errata or improvements in the algorithms. I have not use the code in this repository for my consulting work in over a decade.\r\n\r\nThe third edition of the textbook does not mention this code, but includes considerably expanded and corrected listings in the text in a language neutral format. I would recommend that version.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Historical Information\r\n\r\nThe Artificial Intelligence for Games system.\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) Ian Millington 2003-2009. All Rights Reserved.\r\n\r\nThis software is distributed under licence. Use of this software\r\nimplies agreement with all terms and conditions of the accompanying\r\nsoftware licence.\r\n\r\nThis code also contains portions of the AI Core engine.\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) Icosagon Limited 2003-2007. All Rights Reserved.\r\n\r\nPlease see accompanying LICENSE file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nThe code can be extracted to any directory.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlatform Compatibility\r\n======================\r\n\r\nThe software has been designed for platform indepedence as much as\r\npossible. The only file that may need altering for your platform is\r\n./src/timing.cpp which currently wraps the windows multimedia timer.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding\r\n========\r\n\r\nBuilding with Scons\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nThe code can be built using SCONS, available from\r\nhttp://www.scons.org/. Simply cd (change directory) into the build\r\ndirectory and type scons.\r\n\r\n> cd build\r\n> scons\r\n\r\nTo remove intermediate files after building (but leaving the library\r\nand demos):\r\n\r\n> scons -c ../src\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding with Microsoft Visual Studio 8 Professional\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSolution and project files are included for use with Microsoft visual\r\nstudio 8 professional. They may also work with Express edition, but\r\nI've not tested that.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding with CMake on Linux\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nThe code can be built on Linux (and possibly on other platforms)\r\nusing CMake:\r\n\r\n  cd build\r\n  cmake .\r\n  make\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nTo build the documentation (see below) you must have doxygen\r\ninstalled (it is available from http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/\r\nSimply cd into the ./doc/build/doxygen directory, then type:\r\n\r\n> doxygen aicore.config\r\n\r\nto build the documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nLayout\r\n======\r\n\r\nThe build process creates a statically linked library in ./lib which\r\ncan be used with the include headers in ./include. The demo programs\r\nare built and placed in the ./bin directory.\r\n\r\nSource code is contained in the ./src directory, and documentation\r\nis in the ./doc directory, in particular the reference documentation\r\nis in the ./doc/ref directory.\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThe source code is heavily documented, and the contents correspond to\r\nthe discussion in the \"Artificial Intelligence for Games\" book.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to create 'doxygen' documentation with the tags in the\r\nsource code files, and a configuration for building the documentation\r\nis provided in the ./doc/build/doxygen directory. The doxygen\r\nconfiguration supplied provides only html output, since other output\r\nformats depend on how your machine is configured.\r\n\r\nThis is not currently targeted from the scons configuration, because\r\nscons suport for doxygen depends on where doxygen is installed on your\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n\r\nDemos\r\n=====\r\n\r\nTo run the demos you will require OpenGL and GLUT installed on your\r\nmachine, and the relevant DLLs or shared objects on the path.\r\n\r\n"
