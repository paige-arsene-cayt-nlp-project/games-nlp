  "readme_contents": "### What are we doing?\n\nWe\u2019re updating the first million selling computer book, [BASIC Computer Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Computer_Games), for 2022 and beyond!\n\n- [Read the original book](https://annarchive.com/files/Basic_Computer_Games_Microcomputer_Edition.pdf) (pdf)\n- [Play the original games in your browser](https://troypress.com/wp-content/uploads/user/js-basic/index.html)\n\n### Where can we discuss it?\n\nPlease see [the discussion here](https://discourse.codinghorror.com/t/-/7927) for a worklog and conversation around this project.\n\n### Project structure\n\nI have moved all [the original BASIC source code](http://www.vintage-basic.net/games.html) into a folder for each project in the original book (first volume). Note that Lyle Kopnicky has generously normalized all the code (thanks Lyle!) to run against [Vintage Basic](http://www.vintage-basic.net/download.html) circa 2009:\n\n> I\u2019ve included all the games here for your tinkering pleasure. I\u2019ve tested and tweaked each one of them to make sure they\u2019ll run with Vintage BASIC, though you may see a few oddities. That\u2019s part of the fun of playing with BASIC: it never works quite the same on two machines. The games will play better if you keep CAPS LOCK on, as they were designed to be used with capital-letter input.\n\nEach project has subfolders corresponding to the languages we\u2019d like to see the games ported to. This is based on the [2022 TIOBE index of top languages](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) that are _**memory safe**_ and _**general purpose scripting languages**_ per [this post](https://discourse.codinghorror.com/t/-/7927/34):\n\n1. C# \n2. Java\n3. JavaScript\n4. Kotlin\n5. Lua\n6. Perl\n7. Python\n8. Ruby\n9. Rust\n10. VB.NET\n\n> \ud83d\udce2 Note that in March 2022 we removed Pascal / Object Pascal and replaced it with Rust as we couldn\u2019t determine if Pascal is effectively memory safe. We\u2019ve also added Lua, as it made the top 20 in TIOBE (as of 2022) and it is both memory safe and a scripting language. The Pascal ports were moved to the alternate languages folder.\n\n> \u26a0\ufe0f Please note that we have decided, as a project, that we **do not want any IDE-specific or build-specific files in the repository.** Please refrain from committing any files to the repository that only exist to work with a specific IDE or a specific build system.\n\n### Alternate Languages\n\nIf you wish to port one of the programs to a language not in our list \u2013 that is, a language which is either not memory safe, or not a general purpose scripting language, you can do so via the `00_Alternate_Languages` folder. Place your port in the appropriate game subfolder, in a subfolder named for the language. Please note that these ports are appreciated, but they will not count toward the donation total at the end of the project.\n\n### Project goals\n\nFeel free to begin converting these classic games into the above list of modern, memory safe languages. In fact, courtesy of @mojoaxel, you can even view the JavaScript versions in your web browser at\n\nhttps://coding-horror.github.io/basic-computer-games/\n\nBut first, a few guidelines:\n\n- **These are very old games**. They date from the mid-70s so they\u2019re not exactly examples of what kids (or anyone, really?) would be playing these days. Consider them more like classic programming exercises to teach programming.  We\u2019re paying it forward by converting them into modern languages, so the next generation can learn from the programs in this classic book \u2013 and compare implementations across common modern languages.\n\n- **Stay true to the original program**. These are mostly unsophisticated, simple command line / console games, so we should strive to replicate the command line / console output and behavior illustrated in the original book. See the README in the project folder for links to the original scanned source input and output. Try [running the game in your browser](https://troypress.com/wp-content/uploads/user/js-basic/index.html). Avoid the impulse to add features; keep it simple, _except_ for modern conventions, see next item \ud83d\udc47\n\n- **Please DO update for modern coding conventions**. Support uppercase and lowercase. Use structured programming. Use subroutines. Try to be an example of good, modern coding practices!\n\n- **Use lots of comments to explain what is going on**. Comment liberally! If there were clever tricks in the original code, decompose those tricks into simpler (even if more verbose) code, and use comments to explain what\u2019s happening and why. If there is something particularly tricky about a program, edit the **Porting Notes** section of the `readme.md` to let everyone know. Those `GOTO`s can be very pesky..\n\n- **Please don\u2019t get _too_ fancy**. Definitely use the most recent versions and features of the target language, but also try to keep the code samples simple and explainable \u2013 the goal is to teach programming in the target language, not necessarily demonstrate the cleverest one-line tricks, or big system \"enterprise\" coding techniques designed for thousands of lines of code.\n\n- **Please don't check in any build specific or IDE specific files**. We want the repository to be simple and clean, so we have ruled out including any IDE or build system specific files from the repository. Git related files are OK, as we are using Git and this is GitHub. \ud83d\ude09\n\n### Emulation and Bugfixes\n\nWe want the general behavior of the original programs to be preserved, _however_, we also want to update them, specifically:\n\n- allow both UPPERCASE and lowercase input and display\n- incorporate any bugfixes to the original programs; see the `readme.md` in the game folder\n- improved error handling for bad or erroneous input\n\nPlease note that on the back of the Basic Computer Games book it says **Microsoft 8K Basic, Rev 4.0 was the version David Ahl used to test**, so that is the level of compatibility we are looking for. \u00a0QBasic on the DOS emulation is a\u00a0later version of Basic but one that retains downwards compatibility so far in our testing. To verify behavior, try [running the programs in your browser](https://troypress.com/wp-content/uploads/user/js-basic/index.html) with [JS BASIC, effectively Applesoft BASIC](https://github.com/inexorabletash/jsbasic/).\n\n### Have fun!\n\nThank you for taking part in this project to update a classic programming book \u2013 one of the most influential programming books in computing history \u2013 for 2022 and beyond!\n\nNOTE: per [the official blog post announcement](https://blog.codinghorror.com/updating-the-single-most-influential-book-of-the-basic-era/), I will be **donating $5 for each contributed program in the 10 agreed upon languages to [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/)**.\n"

  "readme_contents": "Free Python Games\n=================\n\n`Free Python Games`_ is an Apache2 licensed collection of free Python games\nintended for education and fun. The games are written in simple Python code and\ndesigned for experimentation and changes. Simplified versions of several\nclassic arcade games are included.\n\nPython is one of the top-five most popular programming languages in the world\nand available for free from `Python.org <https://www.python.org/>`_. Python\nincludes an extensive Standard Library distributed with your installation. The\nStandard Library has a module called Turtle which is a popular way to introduce\nprogramming to kids. Turtle was part of the original Logo programming language\ndeveloped by Wally Feurzig and Seymour Papert in 1966. All of the games in\n`Free Python Games`_ are implemented using Python and its Turtle module.\n\nStarting in 2012, `Free Python Games`_ began as an after school program to\nteach programming to inner-city youth. The goal was to have fun as much as it\nwas to learn. Since then the games have been improved and used in a variety of\nsettings ranging from classrooms to summer day-camps.\n\nThe games run anywhere Python can be installed which includes desktop computers\nrunning Windows, Mac OS, or Linux and older or low-power hardware such as the\nRaspberry Pi. Kids across the United States in grades 6th-12th have enjoyed\nlearning about topics such as encryption and projectile motion through games.\n\nEach game is entirely independent from the others and includes comments along\nwith a list of exercises to work through with students. Creativity and\nflexibility is important. There is no right or wrong way to implement a new\nfeature or behavior! You never know which games students will engage with best.\n\n.. _`Free Python Games`: http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/freegames/\n\n\nTestimonials\n------------\n\n*\"I love Free Python Games because the games are fun and they're easy to\nunderstand and change. I like making my own games now.\"*\n\n-- Luke Martin, Student\n\n*\"Free Python Games inspired and introduced a new hobby to our son. Thank you so\nmuch for exposing him to coding. He is having so much fun!\"*\n\n-- Mary Lai, Parent\n\n*\"Free Python Games are great because they really engage students and let them\nlearn at their own pace.\"*\n\n-- Rick Schertle, Teacher, Steindorf STEAM School\n\n*\"Free Python Games combines play and learning in a flexible environment that\nreduces the stress of a difficult topic like programming.\"*\n\n-- Brett Bymaster, Youth Pastor, The River Church Community\n\n*\"Free Python Games is great for students, is highly organized and flexible,\nand seeks to unleash inquiry and understanding.\"*\n\n-- Terri Furton, Principal, Downtown College Prep\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Fun to play!\n- Simple Python code\n- Easy to install\n- Designed for education\n- Depends only on the Python Standard Library\n- Used in hundreds of hours of classroom instruction\n- Fully Documented\n- 100% Test Coverage\n- Developed on Python 3.10\n- Tested on CPython 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10\n- Tested on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows\n- Tested using GitHub Actions\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/grantjenks/free-python-games/workflows/integration/badge.svg\n   :target: http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/freegames/\n\n\nQuickstart\n----------\n\nInstalling Free Python Games is simple with `pip\n<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_::\n\n  $ python3 -m pip install freegames\n\nFree Python Games supports a command-line interface (CLI). Help for the CLI is\navailable using::\n\n  $ python3 -m freegames --help\n\nThe CLI supports three commands: list, copy, and show. For a list of all games\nrun::\n\n  $ python3 -m freegames list\n\nAny of the listed games may be played by executing the Python module from the\ncommand-line. To reference the Python module, combine \"freegames\" with the name\nof the game. For example, to play the \"snake\" game run::\n\n  $ python3 -m freegames.snake\n\nGames can be modified by copying their source code. The copy command will\ncreate a Python file in your local directory which you can edit. For example,\nto copy and play the \"snake\" game run::\n\n  $ python3 -m freegames copy snake\n  $ python3 snake.py\n\nPython includes a built-in text editor named IDLE which can also execute Python\ncode. To launch the editor and make changes to the \"snake\" game run::\n\n  $ python3 -m idlelib.idle snake.py\n\nYou can also access documentation in the interpreter with Python's built-in\nhelp function::\n\n  >>> import freegames\n  >>> help(freegames)\n\n\nFree Games\n----------\n\nPaint\n.....\n\n`Paint`_ -- draw lines and shapes on the screen.

  "readme_contents": "\nRecast & Detour\n===============\n\n[![Travis (Linux) Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/recastnavigation/recastnavigation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/recastnavigation/recastnavigation)\n[![Appveyor (Windows) Build  Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/20w84u25b3f8h179/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/recastnavigation/recastnavigation/branch/master)\n\n![screenshot of a navmesh baked with the sample program](/RecastDemo/screenshot.png?raw=true)\n\n## Recast\n\nRecast is state of the art navigation mesh construction toolset for games.\n\n* It is automatic, which means that you can throw any level geometry at it and you will get robust mesh out\n* It is fast which means swift turnaround times for level designers\n* It is open source so it comes with full source and you can customize it to your heart's content. \n\nThe Recast process starts with constructing a voxel mold from a level geometry \nand then casting a navigation mesh over it. The process consists of three steps, \nbuilding the voxel mold, partitioning the mold into simple regions, peeling off \nthe regions as simple polygons.\n\n1. The voxel mold is built from the input triangle mesh by rasterizing the triangles into a multi-layer heightfield. Some simple filters are  then applied to the mold to prune out locations where the character would not be able to move.\n2. The walkable areas described by the mold are divided into simple overlayed 2D regions. The resulting regions have only one non-overlapping contour, which simplifies the final step of the process tremendously.\n3. The navigation polygons are peeled off from the regions by first tracing the boundaries and then simplifying them. The resulting polygons are finally converted to convex polygons which makes them perfect for pathfinding and spatial reasoning about the level. \n\n\n## Detour\n\nRecast is accompanied with Detour, path-finding and spatial reasoning toolkit. You can use any navigation mesh with Detour, but of course the data generated with Recast fits perfectly.\n\nDetour offers simple static navigation mesh which is suitable for many simple cases, as well as tiled navigation mesh which allows you to plug in and out pieces of the mesh. The tiled mesh allows you to create systems where you stream new navigation data in and out as the player progresses the level, or you may regenerate tiles as the world changes. \n\n\n## Recast Demo\n\nYou can find a comprehensive demo project in RecastDemo folder. It is a kitchen sink demo containing all the functionality of the library. If you are new to Recast & Detour, check out [Sample_SoloMesh.cpp](/RecastDemo/Source/Sample_SoloMesh.cpp) to get started with building navmeshes and [NavMeshTesterTool.cpp](/RecastDemo/Source/NavMeshTesterTool.cpp) to see how Detour can be used to find paths.\n\n### Building RecastDemo\n\nRecastDemo uses [premake5](http://premake.github.io/) to build platform specific projects. Download it and make sure it's available on your path, or specify the path to it.\n\n#### Linux\n\n- Install SDL2 and its dependencies according to your distro's guidelines.\n- run `premake5 gmake` from the `RecastDemo` folder.\n- `cd Build/gmake` then `make`\n- `cd RecastDemo/Bin` and then run `./RecastDemo`\n\n#### OSX\n\n- Grab the latest SDL2 development library dmg from [here](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) and place `SDL2.framework` in `/Library/Frameworks/`\n- Navigate to the `RecastDemo` folder and run `premake5 xcode4`\n- Open `Build/xcode4/recastnavigation.xcworkspace`\n- Select the \"RecastDemo\" project in the left pane, go to the \"BuildPhases\" tab and expand \"Link Binary With Libraries\"\n- Remove the existing entry for SDL2 (it should have a white box icon) and re-add it by hitting the plus, selecting \"Add Other\", and selecting `/Library/Frameworks/SDL2.framework`.  It should now have a suitcase icon.\n- Set the RecastDemo project as the target and build.\n\n#### Windows\n\n- Grab the latest SDL2 development library release from [here](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) and unzip it `RecastDemo\\Contrib`.  Rename the SDL folder such that the path `RecastDemo\\Contrib\\SDL\\lib\\x86` is valid.\n- Run `\"premake5\" vs2019` from the `RecastDemo` folder\n- Open the solution, build, and run.\n\n### Running Unit tests\n\n- Follow the instructions to build RecastDemo above.  Premake should generate another build target called \"Tests\".\n- Build the \"Tests\" project.  This will generate an executable named \"Tests\" in `RecastDemo/Bin/`\n- Run the \"Tests\" executable.  It will execute all the unit tests, indicate those that failed, and display a count of those that succeeded.\n\n## Integrating with your own project\n\nIt is recommended to add the source directories `DebugUtils`, `Detour`, `DetourCrowd`, `DetourTileCache`, and `Recast` into your own project depending on which parts of the project you need. For example your level building tool could include `DebugUtils`, `Recast`, and `Detour`, and your game runtime could just include `Detour`.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee the [Contributing document](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines for making contributions.\n\n## Discuss\n\n- Discuss Recast & Detour: http://groups.google.com/group/recastnavigation\n- Development blog: http://digestingduck.blogspot.com/\n\n## License\n\nRecast & Detour is licensed under ZLib license, see License.txt for more information.\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Google Play Games plugin for Unity\n_Copyright (c) 2014 Google Inc. All rights reserved._\n\nThe Google Play Games plugin for Unity&reg; is an open-source project whose goal\nis to provide a plugin that allows game developers to integrate with\nthe Google Play Games API from a game written in Unity&reg;. However, this project is\nnot in any way endorsed or supervised by Unity Technologies.\n\n_Unity&reg; is a trademark of Unity Technologies._\n\n_iOS is a trademark of Apple, Inc._\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Google Play Games plugin for Unity allows you to access the Google Play Games\nAPI through Unity's [social interface](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Social.html).\nThe plugin provides support for the\nfollowing features of the Google Play Games API:<br/>\n\n* sign in\n* friends\n* unlock/reveal/increment achievement\n* post score to leaderboard\n* cloud save read/write\n* show built-in achievement/leaderboards UI\n* events\n* [nearby connections](NEARBY.md)\n\n__NOTICE__: This version of the plugin no longer supports iOS.  Google Play games services for iOS is deprecated,\nand is not likely to function as expected. Do not use Google Play games\nservices for iOS in new apps. See the [deprecation announcement](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/04/focusing-our-google-play-games-services.html) blog post for more details.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* easy GUI-oriented project setup (integrated into the Unity GUI)\n* no need to override/customize the player Activity\n* no need to override/customize AndroidManifest.xml\n\nSystem requirements:\n\n* Unity&reg; 2017.4 or above.\n\n* To deploy on Android:\n    * Android SDK\n    * Android v4.0 or higher\n    * Google Play Services library, version 11.6 or above\n\n## Upgrading\n\nIf you have already integrated your project with a previous version of the\nplugin and wish to upgrade to a new version, please refer to the\n[upgrade instructions](UPGRADING.txt).\n\n## Configure Your Game\n\nTo use the plugin, you must first [configure your\ngame](https://developers.google.com/games/services/console/enabling) in the\nGoogle Play Developer Console. Follow the instructions on creating a client ID.\nBe particularly careful when entering your package name and your\ncertificate fingerprints, since mistakes on those screens can be difficult to\nrecover from.\n\n### Copy the game resources from the console\n\nOnce you configure at least one resource (event, achievement, or leaderboard),\ncopy the resource configuration from the Google Play Developer Console, and paste it\ninto the setup configuration in Unity.  To get the resources go to the Achievements\ntab, then click on \"Get resources\" on the bottom of the list.\n\n![click Get Resources](docgen/resourcesLink.png \"Show the resources data\")\n\nThen click the \"Android section\".\n\n![Android Resources](docgen/resources.png \"Android resource data\")\n\nSelect all the contents of the resources window, and copy them to the clipboard.\n\n### Paste the game resources into the plugin setup dialog\n\nBack in Unity, open the setup dialog **Window > Google Play Games > Setup... > Android Setup**\n\n![Android Setup](docgen/AndroidSetup.png \"Android setup\")\n\n * **Enter the directory to save constants** - Enter the folder for the constants file.\n * **Constants class name** - this is the name of the C# class to create, including namespace.\n * **Resources Definition** - paste the resource data from the Play Games console here.\n * **Web client ID** - this is the client ID of the linked web app.  It is only needed if\nyou have a web-based backend for your game and need a server auth code to be\nexchanged for an access token by the backend server, or if you need an id token\nfor the player to make other, non-game, API calls.\n\nThe setup process will configure your game with the client id and generate a\nC# class that contains constants for each of your resources.\n\n## Setup Checklist\n\nMake sure to do the following if they are relevant to your game:\n\n1. Add tester email addresses to the testing section of your game on the Play Games Console.\n2. The SHA1 fingerprint used to create the linked Android app is from the keystore\nused to sign the Unity application.\n\n## Add Achievements and Leaderboards\n\nAdd\n[achievements](https://developers.google.com/games/services/common/concepts/achievements)\nand\n[leaderboards](https://developers.google.com/games/services/common/concepts/leaderboards)\nto your game in the Google Play Developer Console. For each achievement and\nleaderboard you configure, make sure to note\nthe corresponding **achievement ID** or **leaderboard ID**,\nas those will be needed when making the API calls.\nAchievement and leaderboard IDs are alphanumeric strings (e.g.  \"Cgkx9eiuwi8_AQ\").\n\n## Add Events\n\nEvents allow you to track user actions in your game and report on them with\nAnalytics.\nRead more about how to configure and use Events on\n[Game Concepts - Events](https://developers.google.com/games/services/common/concepts/events)\n\n## Load Your Game Project\n\nNext, load your game project into the Unity editor.\n\nIf you do not have a game project to work with, you can use the **Minimal** sample\navailable in the **samples** directory. Using that sample will allow you to\nquickly test your setup and make sure you can access the API.\n\nIf you want to test a larger sample after you are familiar with the plugin,\ntry the **CubicPilot** game.\nMore information about building the samples can be found in the\n[samples README](samples/README.md) file.\n\n## Plugin Installation\n\nTo download the plugin, clone this Git repository into your file system (or download it as\na ZIP file and unpack it). Then, look for the **unitypackage** file in\nthe **current-build** directory:\n\n    current-build/GooglePlayGamesPluginForUnity-X.YY.ZZ.unitypackage\n\nTo install the plugin, simply open your game project in Unity and import that file into\nyour project's assets, as you would any other Unity package. This is accomplished through\nthe **Assets > Import Package > Custom Package** menu item (you can also reach this menu it\nby right-clicking the **Assets** folder).\n\nNext, make sure your current build platform is set to **Android**. From\n**File > Build Settings\u2026** select **Android** and click **Switch Platform**.\nYou should now see a new menu item was added under **Window > Google Play Games**.\nIf you don't see the new menu items, refresh the assets by\nclicking **Assets > Refresh** and try again.\n\n## Android Setup\n\nNext, set up the path to your Android SDK installation in Unity. This is located in the\npreferences menu, under the **External Tools** section.\n\nTo configure your Unity game to run with Google Play Games on Android, first\nopen the Android SDK manager and verify that you have downloaded the following\npackages.  Depending on if you are using the SDK manager from Android Studio,\nor using the standalone SDK manager, the name of the components may be different.\n- Google Play Services\n- Android Support Library\n- Local Maven repository for Support Libraries (Also known as Android Support Repository)\n- Google Repository\n- Android 6.0 (API 23) (this does not affect the min SDK version).\n\nNext, configure your game's package name. To do this, click **File > Build Settings**,\nselect the **Android** platform and click **Player Settings** to show Unity's\nPlayer Settings window. In that window, look for the **Bundle Identifier** setting\nunder **Other Settings**. Enter your package name there (for example\n_com.example.my.awesome.game_).\n\nIn order to sign in to Play Game Services, you need to sign your APK file,\nmake sure that you are signing it with the\ncorrect certificate, that is, the one that corresponds to the SHA1 certificate\nfingerprint you entered in the Developer Console during the setup.\n\nNext, click the **Window |Google Play Games|Setup - Android setup** menu item.\nThis will display the Android setup screen.\n\nEnter the Constants class name.  This is the name of the fully qualified class\nthat will be updated (or created) which contains the IDs of the game resources.\nThe format of the name is <namespace>.<classname>.  For example, `AwesomeGame.GPGSIds`\n\nPaste the resource definition data.  This is the XML data from the Google Play Developer Console\nwhich contains the resource IDs as well as the Application ID for Android.\n\nThis data is found in the Google Play Developer Console by clicking \"Get resources\" on any of the\nresource pages (e.g. Achievements or Leaderboards), then clicking Android.\n\nAfter pasting the data into the text area, click the **Setup** button.\n\n**Note:**  If you are using a web application or backend server with your game,\nyou can link the web application to the game to enable getting the player's\nid token and/or email address.  To do this, link a web application to the\ngame in the Google Play Developer Console, and enter the client id for\nthe web application into the setup dialog.\n\n### Additional instructions on building for Android on Windows\n\nIf you are using Windows, you must make sure that your Java SDK installation\ncan be accessed by Unity. To do this:\n\n1. Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to your Java SDK installation path\n(for example, `C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_45`).\n2. Add the Java SDK's `bin` folder to your `PATH` environment variable\n(for example, `C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_45\\bin`)\n3. Reboot.\n\n**How to edit environment variables:** In Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7,\nright-click **My Computer**, then **Properties**, then go to **Advanced System Properties**\n(or **System Properties** and then click the **Advanced** tab), then\nclick **Environment Variables**. On Windows 8, press **Windows Key + W** and\nsearch for **environment variables**\nFor more information, consult the documentation for your version of Windows.\n\n## Run the Project\n\nIf you are working with the **Smoketest** sample, you should be able to build\nand run the project at this point. You will see the automatic sign-in attempt,\nwhen **Smoketest** starts.\n\nTo build and run on Android, click\n**File > Build Settings**, select the **Android** platform, then\n**Switch to Platform**, then **Build and Run**.\n\n## ISocialPlatform Compliance\n\nThe Google Play Games plugin implements  Unity's\n[social interface](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Social.html),\nfor compatibility with games that already use that interface when integrating with other\nplatforms. However, some features are unique to Play Games and are\noffered as extensions to the standard social interface provided by Unity.\n\nThe standard API calls can be accessed through the **Social.Active** object,\nwhich is a reference to an **ISocialPlatform** interface. The non-standard\nGoogle Play Games extensions can be accessed by casting the **Social.Active**\nobject to the **PlayGamesPlatform** class, where the additional methods are\navailable.\n\n## Nearby Connections Configuration\nIn order to use nearby connections, a service id which uniquely identifies the\nset of applications that can interact needs to be configured.\nThis is done by clicking the **Window > Google Play Games > Nearby Connections setup...**\nmenu item. This will display the\nnearby connections setup screen.  On this screen enter the service ID you want to use.\nIt should be something that identifies your application, and  follows the\nsame rules as the bundle id (for example: com.example.myawesomegame.nearby).\nOnce you enter the id, press **Setup**.\n\nTo use nearby connections, the player does not need to be authenticated,\nand no Google Play Developer Console configuration is needed.\n\nFor detailed information on nearby connection usage,\nplease refer to [nearby connections](NEARBY.md).\n\n## Sign in\n\nA connection to Game services will be automatically formed when your game is opened.\nOnce the connection is successful the player will be welcomed with a pop-up and\nyour game is ready to begin using the Games Unity Plugin.\n\nNote: If a user has never used Google Play Games on this device, they will be\nautomatically taken through one-time setup operations such as creating a profile\nwith the Play Games app.\n\nIn the Start method of your script, listen to the result of the automatic sign-in\nattempt, fetch the authentication status and disable Play Games Services features\nif the user is not signed in.\n\n```csharp\n    using GooglePlayGames;\n\n    public void Start() {\n      PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.Authenticate(ProcessAuthentication);\n    }\n\n    internal void ProcessAuthentication(SignInStatus status) {\n      if (status == SignInStatus.Success) {\n        // Continue with Play Games Services\n      } else {\n        // Disable your integration with Play Games Services or show a login button\n        // to ask users to sign-in. Clicking it should call\n        // PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.ManuallyAuthenticate(ProcessAuthentication).\n      }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe result code is an enum, which gives you different failure reasons that will\nhelp you understand sign-in failures better.\n\nIf you prefer using Unity\u2019s Social platform, then you can alternatively use the\ncode block below.\n\n```csharp\n  using GooglePlayGames;\n\n  public void Start() {\n    PlayGamesPlatform.Activate();\n    Social.localUser.Authenticate(ProcessAuthentication);\n  }\n```\n\nNote that you cannot make any games API calls (unlock achievements, post scores,\netc) until you get a successful return value from **Authenticate**, so it is\ngood practice to put up a standby screen until the callback is called, to make\nsure the user can't start playing the game until the authentication process\ncompletes.\n\n## Friends\n\nPlay Games Friends allows players to create and maintain a cross-games friends list. You can request access to this friends list to help your players play your game with their friends. See the [Friends concept page](https://developers.google.com/games/services/common/concepts/friends) for more details on the friends system.\n\nTo enable Friends, use the following functions:\n\n*  [View friends](https://github.com/playgameservices/play-games-plugin-for-unity#view-friends): Request access to a player\u2019s friends list, so you can add their play games friends to your in-game friends list\n*  [View a player profile](https://github.com/playgameservices/play-games-plugin-for-unity#view-a-player-profile): Let a player view the Play Games profile of another player. This is essential so a player knows who their friends are, and can connect to other Play Games players in your game. This will need to be tied to a UI element to trigger the popup. See the [friends guidelines](https://developers.google.com/games/services/checklist#friends) for details.\n\nSee the [best practices guidelines](https://developers.google.com/games/services/checklist#friends) for instructions on how best to implement these APIs.\n\nNote: To use Friends, you need to update your PGS SDK to version 20.0.0\n\n\n### View friends\n\nThere are two ways to load friends, either using the `ISocial` framework or directly with `PlayGamesPlatform`.\n\n#### Loading friends with the ISocial framework\n\n```csharp\nSocial.localUser.LoadFriends((success) =>  {\n    Debug.Log(\"Friends loaded OK: \" + ok));\n    foreach(IUserProfile p in Social.localUser.friends) {\n         Debug.Log(p.userName + \" is a friend\");\n    }\n```\n\nHowever, this call will fail if the current player has not yet granted permission to the game to access this information. Use `GetLastLoadFriendsStatus` to check if `LoadFriends` failed due to missing consent.\n\n```csharp\n PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.GetLastLoadFriendsStatus((status) => {\n    // Check for consent\n    if (status == LoadFriendsStatus.ResolutionRequired) {\n        // Ask for resolution.\n    }\n});\n```\n\nA game can ask the current player to share the friends list by calling `AskForLoadFriendsResolution`.\n\n```csharp\nPlayGamesPlatform.Instance.AskForLoadFriendsResolution((result) => {\n    if (result == UIStatus.Valid) {\n        // User agreed to share friends with the game. Reload friends.\n    } else {\n        // User doesn\u2019t agree to share the friends list.\n    }\n});\n```\n\nThis function will show the appropriate platform-specific friends sharing UI. This UI asks the player if they want to share their friends with the game.\n\n#### Loading friends with PlayGamesPlatform\n\nAnother way of loading friends is to use `LoadFriends` and `LoadMoreFriends`:\n\n```csharp\nPlayGamesPlatform.Instance.LoadFriends(pageSize, forceReload, (status) => {\n    // Check if the call is successful and if there are more friends to load.\n});\n\nPlayGamesPlatform.Instance.LoadMoreFriends(pageSize, (status) => {\n    // Check if there are more friends to load.\n});\n```\n\nThe `pageSize` param represents the number of entries to request for this page. Note that if cached data already exists, the returned buffer may contain more than this size. The buffer is guaranteed to contain at least this many entries if the collection contains enough records. If `forceReload` is set to `true`, this call will clear any locally-cached data and attempt to fetch the latest data from the server. This would commonly be used for actions like a user-initiated refresh. Normally, this should be set to `false` to gain the advantages of data caching.\n\nIf the callback returns `LoadFriendsStatus.LoadMore`, then there are more friends to load. `LoadFriendsStatus.ResolutionRequired` signals that the user has not shared the friends list and you can directly call `PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.AskForLoadFriendsResolution`.\n\n#### Determining friends list visibility\n\nUse `PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.GetFriendsListVisibility` to check if the user has shared the friends list with the game. Possible return statuses are:\n\n   * `FriendsListVisibilityStatus.RequestRequired` indicates you must ask for consent. \n   * `FriendsListVisibilityStatus.Visible` indicates that loading the friends list should succeed.\n   * `FriendsListVisibilityStatus.Unknown` generally shouldn't happen. You can set `forceReload` to true to refresh the data.\n\n```csharp\nPlayGamesPlatform.Instance.GetFriendsListVisibility(forceReload, (friendsListVisibilityStatus) => {});\n```\n\n### View a player profile\n\nTo add or remove a player as a friend, use the show and compare profile function. This function triggers a bottom sheet dialog showing the Play Games profile of the user; call the function with the player Id of the requested player. If the player and friend have in-game nicknames, use them in the call to add more context to the profile UI:\n\n```csharp\nPlayGamesPlatform.Instance.ShowCompareProfileWithAlternativeNameHintsUI(\n    mFirstFriendId, /* otherPlayerInGameName= */ null, /* currentPlayerInGameName= */ null,\n    (result) => {\n        // Profile comparison view has closed.\n});\n```\n\n## Player Statistics\n\nThe Player Stats API let you tailor game experiences to specific segments\nof players and different stages of the player lifecycle. You can build\ntailored experiences for each player segment based on how players are\nprogressing, spending, and engaging. For example, you can use this API to\ntake proactive actions to encourage a less active player to re-engage with\nyour game, such as by displaying and promoting new in-game items when the\nplayer signs in.\n\nThe callback takes two parameters:\n1. The result code less than or equal to zero is success.\n        See [CommonStatusCodes](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/common/api/CommonStatusCodes) for all values.\n2. The PlayerStats object of type GooglePlayGames.PlayGamesLocalUser.PlayerStats\n\nFor more information see [Player Stats](https://developers.google.com/games/services/android/stats).\n\nThe player stats are available after authenticating:\n\n```csharp\n    ((PlayGamesLocalUser)Social.localUser).GetStats((rc, stats) =>\n        {\n            // -1 means cached stats, 0 is succeess\n            // see  CommonStatusCodes for all values.\n            if (rc <= 0 && stats.HasDaysSinceLastPlayed()) {\n                Debug.Log(\"It has been \" + stats.DaysSinceLastPlayed + \" days\");\n            }\n        });\n```\n\n## Revealing/Unlocking an Achievement\n\nTo unlock an achievement, use the **Social.ReportProgress** method with a\nprogress value of 100.0f:\n\n```csharp\n    using GooglePlayGames;\n    using UnityEngine.SocialPlatforms;\n    ...\n    // unlock achievement (achievement ID \"Cfjewijawiu_QA\")\n    Social.ReportProgress(\"Cfjewijawiu_QA\", 100.0f, (bool success) => {\n      // handle success or failure\n    });\n```\n\nNotice that according to the expected behavior of\n[Social.ReportProgress](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Social.ReportProgress.html),\na progress of 0.0f means revealing the achievement and a progress of 100.0f\nmeans unlocking the achievement. Therefore, to reveal an achievement (that was\npreviously hidden) without unlocking it, simply call Social.ReportProgress with\na progress of 0.0f.\n\n## Incrementing an Achievement\n\nIf your achievement is incremental, the Play Games implementation of\n**Social.ReportProgress** will try to behave as closely as possible to the\nexpected behavior according to Unity's social API, but may not be exact. For\nthis reason, we recommend that you do not use Social.ReportProgress for\nincremental achievements. Instead, use the\n**PlayGamesPlatform.IncrementAchievement** method, which is a Play Games\nextension.\n\n```csharp\n    using GooglePlayGames;\n    using UnityEngine.SocialPlatforms;\n    ...\n    // increment achievement (achievement ID \"Cfjewijawiu_QA\") by 5 steps\n    PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.IncrementAchievement(\n        \"Cfjewijawiu_QA\", 5, (bool success) => {\n            // handle success or failure\n    });\n```\n\n## Posting a Score to a Leaderboard\n\nTo post a score to a leaderboard, call **Social.ReportScore**.\n\n```csharp\n    using GooglePlayGames;\n    using UnityEngine.SocialPlatforms;\n    ...\n    // post score 12345 to leaderboard ID \"Cfji293fjsie_QA\")\n    Social.ReportScore(12345, \"Cfji293fjsie_QA\", (bool success) => {\n        // handle success or failure\n    });\n```\n\nTo post a score and include a metadata tag use the Play Game Services instance\ndirectly:\n\n```csharp\n    using GooglePlayGames;\n    using UnityEngine.SocialPlatforms;\n    ...\n    // post score 12345 to leaderboard ID \"Cfji293fjsie_QA\" and tag \"FirstDaily\")\n    Social.ReportScore(12345, \"Cfji293fjsie_QA\", \"FirstDaily\", (bool success) => {\n        // handle success or failure\n    });\n```\n\n\nNote that the platform and the server will automatically discard scores that are\nlower than the player's existing high score, so you can submit scores freely\nwithout any checks to test whether or not the score is greater than the player's\nexisting score.\n\n## Showing the Achievements UI\n\nTo show the built-in UI for all achievements, call\n**Social.ShowAchievementsUI**.\n\n```csharp\n    using GooglePlayGames;\n    using UnityEngine.SocialPlatforms;\n    ...\n    // show achievements UI\n    Social.ShowAchievementsUI();\n```\n\n## Showing the Leaderboard UI\n\nTo show the built-in UI for all leaderboards, call **Social.ShowLeaderboardUI**.\n\n```csharp\n    using GooglePlayGames;\n    using UnityEngine.SocialPlatforms;\n    ...\n    // show leaderboard UI\n    Social.ShowLeaderboardUI();\n```\n\nIf you wish to show a particular leaderboard instead of all leaderboards, you\ncan pass a leaderboard ID to the method. This, however, is a Play Games\nextension, so the Social.Active object needs to be cast to a PlayGamesPlatform\nobject first:\n\n```csharp\n    using GooglePlayGames;\n    using UnityEngine.SocialPlatforms;\n    ...\n    // show leaderboard UI\n    PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.ShowLeaderboardUI(\"Cfji293fjsie_QA\");\n```\n\n## Accessing Leaderboard data\n\nThere are 2 methods to retrieving the leaderboard score data.\n\n### Using Social.ILeaderboard\n\nThis method uses the ILeaderboard interface to define the scope and filters\nfor getting the data.  This approach allows you to configure:\n1. The leaderboard Id\n2. The collection (social or public)\n3. The timeframe (daily, weekly, all-time)\n4. The rank position to start retrieving scores.\n5. The number of scores (the default is 25).\n6. Filter by user id.\n\nIf the from parameter is non-positive, then the results returned are\nplayer-centered, meaning the scores around the current player's score are\nreturned.\n\n```csharp\n    ILeaderboard lb = PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.CreateLeaderboard();\n    lb.id = \"MY_LEADERBOARD_ID\";\n    lb.LoadScores(ok =>\n        {\n            if (ok) {\n                LoadUsersAndDisplay(lb);\n            }\n            else {\n                Debug.Log(\"Error retrieving leaderboardi\");\n            }\n        });\n```\n\n### Using PlayGamesPlatform.LoadScores()\n\nThis method uses the PlayGamesPlatform directly.  This approach provides\nadditional flexibility and information when accessing the leaderboard data.\n\n```csharp\n    PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.LoadScores(\n            GPGSIds.leaderboard_leaders_in_smoketesting,\n            LeaderboardStart.PlayerCentered,\n            100,\n            LeaderboardCollection.Public,\n            LeaderboardTimeSpan.AllTime,\n            (data) =>\n            {\n                mStatus = \"Leaderboard data valid: \" + data.Valid;\n                mStatus += \"\\n approx:\" +data.ApproximateCount + \" have \" + data.Scores.Length;\n            });\n```\n\nThe parameters for LoadScores() are:\n\n1. leaderboardId\n2. start position (top scores or player centered)\n3. row count\n4. leaderboard collection (social or public)\n5. time span (daily, weekly, all-time)\n6. callback accepting a LeaderboardScoreData object.\n\nThe `LeaderboardScoreData` class is used to return information back to the\ncaller when loading scores.  The members are:\n    1. Id - the leaderboard id\n    2. Valid - true if the returned data is valid (the call was successful)\n    3. Status - the ResponseStatus of the call\n    4. ApproximateCount - the approximate number of scores in the leaderboard\n    5. Title - the title of the leaderboard\n    6. PlayerScore - the score of the current player\n    7. Scores - the list of scores\n    8. PrevPageToken - a token that can be used to call `LoadMoreScores()` to\n        get the previous page of scores.\n    9. NextPageToken - a token that can be used to call `LoadMoreScores()` to\n        get the next page of scores.\n\n```csharp\n    void GetNextPage(LeaderboardScoreData data)\n    {\n        PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.LoadMoreScores(data.NextPageToken, 10,\n            (results) =>\n            {\n                mStatus = \"Leaderboard data valid: \" + data.Valid;\n                mStatus += \"\\n approx:\" +data.ApproximateCount + \" have \" + data.Scores.Length;\n            });\n    }\n```\n\nThis call may fail when trying to load friends with `ResponseCode.ResolutionRequired` if the user has not shared their friends list with the game. In this case, use `AskForLoadFriendsResolution` to request access.\n\n### Getting player names\n\nEach score has the userId of the player that made the score.  You can use\n`Social.LoadUsers()` to load the player profile.  Remember that the contents\nof the player profile are subject to privacy settings of the players.\n\n```csharp\n    internal void LoadUsersAndDisplay(ILeaderboard lb)\n    {\n        // get the user ids\n        List<string> userIds = new List<string>();\n\n        foreach(IScore score in lb.scores) {\n            userIds.Add(score.userID);\n        }\n        // load the profiles and display (or in this case, log)\n        Social.LoadUsers(userIds.ToArray(), (users) =>\n            {\n                string status = \"Leaderboard loading: \" + lb.title + \" count = \" +\n                    lb.scores.Length;\n                foreach(IScore score in lb.scores) {\n                    IUserProfile user = FindUser(users, score.userID);\n                    status += \"\\n\" + score.formattedValue + \" by \" +\n                        (string)(\n                            (user != null) ? user.userName : \"**unk_\" + score.userID + \"**\");\n                }\n                Debug.log(status);\n            });\n    }\n```\n\n## Recording Events\nIncrementing an event is very simple, just call the following method:\n\n```csharp\n    using GooglePlayGames;\n    ...\n    // Increments the event with Id \"YOUR_EVENT_ID\" by 1\n    PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.Events.IncrementEvent(\"YOUR_EVENT_ID\", 1);\n```\nThis call is \"fire and forget\", it will handle batching and execution for you in the background.\n\n## Saving Game State to the Cloud\n\nFor details on saved games concepts and APIs please refer to the  [documentation](https://developers.google.com/games/services/common/concepts/savedgames).\n\n### Displaying saved games UI ###\n\nThe standard UI for selecting or creating a saved game entry is displayed by calling:\n\n```csharp\n    void ShowSelectUI() {\n        uint maxNumToDisplay = 5;\n        bool allowCreateNew = false;\n        bool allowDelete = true;\n\n        ISavedGameClient savedGameClient = PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.SavedGame;\n        savedGameClient.ShowSelectSavedGameUI(\"Select saved game\",\n            maxNumToDisplay,\n            allowCreateNew,\n            allowDelete,\n            OnSavedGameSelected);\n    }\n\n\n    public void OnSavedGameSelected (SelectUIStatus status, ISavedGameMetadata game) {\n        if (status == SelectUIStatus.SavedGameSelected) {\n            // handle selected game save\n        } else {\n            // handle cancel or error\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n### Opening a saved game ###\n\nIn order to read or write data to a saved game, the saved game needs to be opened. Since the saved game state is cached locally\non the device and saved to the cloud, it is possible to encounter conflicts in the state of the saved data. A conflict\nhappens when a device attempts to save state to the cloud but the data currently on the cloud was written by a different device.\nThese conflicts need to be resolved when opening the saved game data.  There are 2 open methods that handle conflict resolution,\nthe first **OpenWithAutomaticConflictResolution** accepts a standard resolution strategy type and automatically resolves the conflicts.\nThe other method, **OpenWithManualConflictResolution** accepts a callback method to allow the manual resolution of the conflict.\n\nSee __GooglePlayGames/BasicApi/SavedGame/ISavedGameClient.cs__ for more details on these methods.\n\n```csharp\n    void OpenSavedGame(string filename) {\n        ISavedGameClient savedGameClient = PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.SavedGame;\n        savedGameClient.OpenWithAutomaticConflictResolution(filename, DataSource.ReadCacheOrNetwork,\n            ConflictResolutionStrategy.UseLongestPlaytime, OnSavedGameOpened);\n    }\n\n    public void OnSavedGameOpened(SavedGameRequestStatus status, ISavedGameMetadata game) {\n        if (status == SavedGameRequestStatus.Success) {\n            // handle reading or writing of saved game.\n        } else {\n            // handle error\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n### Writing a saved game ###\n\nOnce the saved game file is opened, it can be written to save the game state.  This is done by calling **CommitUpdate**.\nThere are four parameters to CommitUpdate:\n\n1. the saved game metadata passed to the callback passed to one of the Open calls.\n2. the updates to make to the metadata.\n3. the actual byte array of data\n4. a callback to call when the commit is complete.\n\n```csharp\n    void SaveGame (ISavedGameMetadata game, byte[] savedData, TimeSpan totalPlaytime) {\n        ISavedGameClient savedGameClient = PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.SavedGame;\n\n        SavedGameMetadataUpdate.Builder builder = new SavedGameMetadataUpdate.Builder();\n        builder = builder\n            .WithUpdatedPlayedTime(totalPlaytime)\n            .WithUpdatedDescription(\"Saved game at \" + DateTime.Now());\n        if (savedImage != null) {\n            // This assumes that savedImage is an instance of Texture2D\n            // and that you have already called a function equivalent to\n            // getScreenshot() to set savedImage\n            // NOTE: see sample definition of getScreenshot() method below\n            byte[] pngData = savedImage.EncodeToPNG();\n            builder = builder.WithUpdatedPngCoverImage(pngData);\n        }\n        SavedGameMetadataUpdate updatedMetadata = builder.Build();\n        savedGameClient.CommitUpdate(game, updatedMetadata, savedData, OnSavedGameWritten);\n    }\n\n    public void OnSavedGameWritten (SavedGameRequestStatus status, ISavedGameMetadata game) {\n        if (status == SavedGameRequestStatus.Success) {\n            // handle reading or writing of saved game.\n        } else {\n            // handle error\n        }\n    }\n\n    public Texture2D getScreenshot() {\n        // Create a 2D texture that is 1024x700 pixels from which the PNG will be\n        // extracted\n        Texture2D screenShot = new Texture2D(1024, 700);\n\n        // Takes the screenshot from top left hand corner of screen and maps to top\n        // left hand corner of screenShot texture\n        screenShot.ReadPixels(\n            new Rect(0, 0, Screen.width, (Screen.width/1024)*700), 0, 0);\n        return screenShot;\n    }\n\n```\n\n### Reading a saved game ###\n\nOnce the saved game file is opened, it can be read to load the game state.  This is done by calling **ReadBinaryData**.\n\n\n```csharp\n    void LoadGameData (ISavedGameMetadata game) {\n        ISavedGameClient savedGameClient = PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.SavedGame;\n        savedGameClient.ReadBinaryData(game, OnSavedGameDataRead);\n    }\n\n    public void OnSavedGameDataRead (SavedGameRequestStatus status, byte[] data) {\n        if (status == SavedGameRequestStatus.Success) {\n            // handle processing the byte array data\n        } else {\n            // handle error\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n### Deleting a saved game ###\n\nOnce the saved game file is opened, it can be deleted. This is done by calling **Delete**.\n\n\n```csharp\n    void DeleteGameData (string filename) {\n        // Open the file to get the metadata.\n        ISavedGameClient savedGameClient = PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.SavedGame;\n        savedGameClient.OpenWithAutomaticConflictResolution(filename, DataSource.ReadCacheOrNetwork,\n            ConflictResolutionStrategy.UseLongestPlaytime, DeleteSavedGame);\n    }\n\n    public void DeleteSavedGame(SavedGameRequestStatus status, ISavedGameMetadata game) {\n        if (status == SavedGameRequestStatus.Success) {\n            ISavedGameClient savedGameClient = PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.SavedGame;\n            savedGameClient.Delete(game);\n        } else {\n            // handle error\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n## Retrieving server authentication codes ##\nIn order to access Google APIs on a backend web server on behalf of the current\nplayer, you need to get an authentication code from the client application and\npass this to your web server application.  This code can then be exchanged for\nan access token to make calls to the various APIs.\nFor more details on this flow see: [Google Sign-In for Websites](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/server-side-flow).\n\nTo get the server side access code:\n1. Configure the web client id of the web application linked to your game in the\nPlay Game Console.\n2. Call `PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.RequestServerSideAccess` once the player is\n  authenticated to get the server side access code.\n3. Pass this code to your server application.\n\n```csharp\n  PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.RequestServerSideAccess(\n    /* forceRefreshToken= */ false,\n    code -> {\n      // send code to server\n    });\n```\n\n## Decreasing apk size\n\nIt is possible to decrease the size of the Play Games Services Unity Plugin by removing code for the Play Games Services features that your game doesn\u2019t use by using Proguard. Proguard will remove the Play Games Unity plugin code for features that are not used in your game, so your game ships with only the code that is needed and minimizes the size impact of using Play Games Services.\n\nAdditionally, it is possible to reduce the size of the entire Unity project using Unity\u2019s [Managed Code Stripping](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ManagedCodeStripping.html), which will compress your entire project.  This can be used in conjunction with Proguard.\n\n### Play Games Services Proguard configuration\n\n1. Go to `File > Build Settings > Player Settings` and click `Publishing Settings` section. Choose `Proguard` for `Minify > Release`. Then, enable `User Proguard File`. If you want the plugin to be proguarded for debug apks as well, you can choose `Proguard` for `Minify > Debug`.\n2. Copy the content of [the proguard configuration](scripts/proguard.txt) into `Assets/Plugins/Android/proguard-user.txt`.\n\n## (Advanced) Using the Plugin Without Overriding the Default Social Platform\n\nWhen you call `PlayGamesPlatform.Activate`, Google Play Games becomes your default social platform implementation, which means that static calls to methods in `Social` and `Social.Active` will be carried out by the Google Play Games plugin. This is the desired behavior for most games using the plugin.\n\nHowever, if for some reason you wish to keep the default implementation accessible (for example, to use it to submit achievements and leaderboards to a different social platform), you can use the Google Play Games plugin without overriding the default one. To do this:\n\n1. Do not call `PlayGamesPlatform.Activate`\n2. If `Xyz` is the name of a method you wish to call on the `Social` class, do not call `Social.Xyz`. Instead, call `PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.Xyz`\n3. Do not use `Social.Active` when interacting with Google Play Games. Instead, use `PlayGamesPlatform.Instance`.\n\nThat way, you can even submit scores and achievements simultaneously to two or more social platforms:\n\n```csharp\n    // Submit achievement to original default social platform\n    Social.ReportProgress(\"MyAchievementIdHere\", 100.0f, callback);\n\n    // Submit achievement to Google Play\n    PlayGamesPlatform.Instance.ReportProgress(\"MyGooglePlayAchievementIdHere\", 100.0f, callback);\n```\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nThis section lists people who have contributed to this project by writing code, improving documentation or fixing bugs.\n\n* [Dgizusse](https://github.com/Dgizusse) for figuring out that setting JAVA_HOME is necessary on Windows.\n* [antonlicht](https://github.com/antonlicht) for fixing a bug with the parameter type of showErrorDialog on the support library.\n* [pR0Ps](https://github.com/pR0Ps) for fixing an issue where OnAchievementsLoaded was not accepting an OPERATION_DEFERRED result code as a success.\n* [friikyeu](https://github.com/friikyeu) for helping debug [an issue](https://github.com/playgameservices/play-games-plugin-for-unity/issues/25) that caused API calls to be queued up rather than executed even when connected.\n"

Airtest uses image recognition technology to locate UI elements so that you can automate games and apps without injecting any code. \n\n*   **Fully Scalable:** Airtest cases can be easily run on large device farms, using commandline or python API. HTML reports with detailed info and screen recording allow you to quickly locate failure points. NetEase builds [Airlab](https://airlab.163.com/) on top of the Airtest Project.\n\n*   **AirtestIDE:** AirtestIDE is an out of the box GUI tool that helps to create and run cases in a user-friendly way. AirtestIDE supports a complete automation workflow: ``create -> run -> report``.\n\n*   **Poco:** [Poco](https://github.com/AirtestProject/Poco) adds the ability to directly access object(UI widget) hierarchy across the major platforms and game engines. It allows writing instructions in Python, to achieve more advanced automation.\n\nGet started from [airtest homepage](http://airtest.netease.com/)\n\n#### [Supported Platforms](./docs/wiki/device/platforms.md)\n\n\n## Installation\n\nUse `pip` to install the Airtest python library. \n\n```Shell\npip install -U airtest\n```\n\nOn MacOS/Linux platform, you need to grant adb execute permission.\n\n```Shell\n# for mac\ncd {your_python_path}/site-packages/airtest/core/android/static/adb/mac\n# for linux\n# cd {your_python_path}/site-packages/airtest/core/android/static/adb/linux\nchmod +x adb\n```\n\nDownload AirtestIDE from our [homepage](http://airtest.netease.com/) if you need to use the GUI tool.\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nYou can find the complete Airtest documentation on [readthedocs](http://airtest.readthedocs.io/).\n\n\n## Examples\n\nAirtest aims at providing platform-independent API so that you can write automated cases once and run it on multiple devices and platforms.\n\n1. Using [connect_device](http://airtest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README_MORE.html#connect-device) API you can connect to any android/iOS device or windows application.\n1. Then perform [simulated input](http://airtest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README_MORE.html#simulate-input) to automate your game or app.\n1. **DO NOT** forget to [make assertions](http://airtest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README_MORE.html#make-assertion) of the expected result. \n\n```Python\nfrom airtest.core.api import *\n\n# connect an android phone with adb\ninit_device(\"Android\")\n# or use connect_device api\n# connect_device(\"Android:///\")\n\ninstall(\"path/to/your/apk\")\nstart_app(\"package_name_of_your_apk\")\ntouch(Template(\"image_of_a_button.png\"))\nswipe(Template(\"slide_start.png\"), Template(\"slide_end.png\"))\nassert_exists(Template(\"success.png\"))\nkeyevent(\"BACK\")\nhome()\nuninstall(\"package_name_of_your_apk\")\n```\n\nFor more detailed info, please refer to [Airtest Python API reference](http://airtest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/all_module/airtest.core.api.html) or take a look at [API code](./airtest/core/api.py)\n\n\n## Running ``.air`` cases from CLI\n\nUsing AirtestIDE, you can easily create automated cases as ``.air`` directories.\nAirtest CLI provides the possibility to execute cases on different host machines and target device platforms without using AirtestIDE itself.\n\n```Shell\n# run cases targeting on Android phone connected to your host machine via ADB\nairtest run \"path to your .air dir\" --device Android:///\n\n# run cases targeting on Windows application whose title matches Unity.*\nairtest run \"path to your .air dir\" --device \"Windows:///?title_re=Unity.*\"\n\n# generate HTML report after running cases\nairtest report \"path to your .air dir\"\n\n# or use as a python module\npython -m airtest run \"path to your .air dir\" --device Android:///\n```\n\nTry running provided example case: [``airtest/playground/test_blackjack.air``](./playground/test_blackjack.air) and see [Usage of CLI](http://airtest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README_MORE.html#running-air-from-cli). Here is a [multi-device runner sample](https://github.com/AirtestProject/multi-device-runner).\n\n\n## Contribution\n\nPull requests are very welcome. \n\n\n## Thanks\n\nThanks for all these great works that make this project better.\n\n- [stf](https://github.com/openstf)\n- [atx](https://github.com/NetEaseGame/ATX)\n- [pywinauto](https://github.com/pywinauto/pywinauto)\n"

Store or Discover.\nBut can also be accessed [**here**](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl)\n\n#### Debian, Ubuntu and Derivatives\n\nDownload the `heroic_x.x.x_amd64.deb` from the Releases section\n\n```bash\nsudo dpkg -i heroic_x.x.x_amd64.deb\n```\n\n#### Debian (third party `apt` repository)\n\nYou can add the [**MAD Linux**](https://madlinux.sourceforge.io) [`apt` repository](https://gitlab.com/myawesomedistro/madrepo):\n\n```bash\nbash <(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/main/madrepo.sh)\n```\n\nIf you need support on it, get access to **MAD Linux** [**Guilded**](https://guilded.gg/madlinux) server.\n\nMaybe you want to boost the download speed on updates with [`apt-fast`](https://github.com/ilikenwf/apt-fast):\n\n```bash\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:apt-fast/stable\nsudo apt install -y apt-fast\napt-fast install -y heroic\n```\n\n#### Arch (AUR)\n\n[![AUR version](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/heroic-games-launcher-bin?style=flat&label=AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/heroic-games-launcher-bin/)\n\nAUR page: [https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/heroic-games-launcher-bin/](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/heroic-games-launcher-bin/)\n\nTo install it manually use:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://aur.archlinux.org/heroic-games-launcher-bin.git\n\ncd heroic-games-launcher-bin\n\nmakepkg --cleanbuild --syncdeps --install --clean --rmdeps\n```\n\nOtherwise you can install it via your prefered AUR helper, e.g. yay.\n\n#### Fedora\n\nHeroic for Fedora is available on [the COPR repo](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/atim/heroic-games-launcher/) or as the binary on the releases page.\n\n#### Other Distributions (AppImage and TAR.XZ)\n\nDownload the `heroic-x.x.x.AppImage` or `heroic-x.x.x.tar.xz` from the Releases section.\nMake sure you have Curl and Gawk, normally it comes with most distros but check for them if you have any issue.\n\nTo make the AppImage it executable use:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x heroic-x.x.x.AppImage\n```\n\nTo run it use:\n\n```bash\n./heroic-x.x.x.AppImage\n```\n\nFor the tar.xz file, you need first to extract it somewhere, enter the folder and run:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x heroic\n```\n\nTo run it use:\n\n```bash\n./heroic\n```\n\n### Windows\n\nIf you use WinGet, just type: `winget install HeroicGamesLauncher.HeroicGamesLauncher`. otherwise\ndownload Heroic.Setup.x.x.x.exe or the Portable Heroic-x.x.x.exe file and run it. It will install it to the start menu and desktop, use those to run it.\n\n### macOS\n\nIf you use Homebrew, just type: `brew install --cask heroic`. Otherwise, download Heroic-x.x.x.dmg and move the Heroic App to the Applications folder.\n\n### Build binaries locally (All platforms)\n\n- All Platforms:\n  Requires NodeJS to build \\\n  Use yarn or npm\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher.git\n\ncd HeroicGamesLauncher\n```\n\n- Build for Linux:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n\nyarn dist {package to create} (eg: deb, pacman, tar.xz, rpm, AppImage)\n```\n\n- Build for Windows (Beta):\n\n```bash\nyarn.cmd (or npm install)\n\nyarn.cmd (or npm run) dist-win\n```\n\n- Build for Mac (Alpha):\n\n```bash\nyarn (or npm install)\n\nyarn (or npm run) dist-mac\n```\n\n### Any OS (development environment)\n\n1. Download Yarn and Node.js\n2. Download the dependencies with `yarn`\n3. Go to the debug tab on vscode and start the two tasks, 'Start renderer process' and 'Debug main process' or `yarn react-start && yarn electron`\n\n### Building with VS Code\n\n1. Download Yarn and Node.js\n2. Download the dependencies with `yarn`\n3. Open the tasks. Select \"Build with [your OS]\"\n\n### Development Using a Container\n\nIf you would prefer, we have a docker container defined to develop / build Heroic with (a potential reason being to avoid loading tons of dependencies on your host filesystem). There are two methods, based on whether you use VS Code.\n\n**VS Code**\n\nThere is a `.devcontainer` directory containing a definition that VS Code will recognize for automatically opening your local Heroic directory in a container in VS Code.\n\n**NOTE: this requires that you install the 'Remote - Containers' extension.**\n\n1. Open the root of your local Heroic directory in VS Code.\n2. You should get a prompt in the bottom right to build and open the project in the dev container.\n3. If the above prompt does not occur, on the bottom left, there is a green icon that should be there if the remote extension is installed. Click on it, and select \"Reopen in container\".\n4. The bottom left green icon should now say: \"Dev Container: Heroic Games Launcher\".\n\nAfter the container's package manager runs, open a new terminal session and you should be able to run bash commands from within the container. Any yarn dist builds should also now show up on your host filesystem.\n\n**Manually Building the Docker Image**\n\nIf you don't use VS Code or don't want it integrated with the container, you can build and run the container manually using either Docker or Podman.\n\n1. From the root of your local Heroic directory, run:\n\n```bash\ndocker build -t heroicdevcontainer -f Dockerfile .\n```\n\n2. Assuming all went well, you can now enter the container:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it -v ./:/tmp/heroic localhost/heroicdevcontainer:latest\n```\n\n3. The above command will mount your local Heroic dir to `/tmp/heroic` in the container (unless you used a different path).\n\n```\ncd /tmp/heroic\n```\n\nAnd you should be good to go, code and build away!\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![epic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26871415/168448807-768a2ffc-7c6b-4010-bc48-b2f6acec9a32.png)\n![gog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26871415/168448826-3fab90d7-7fba-4774-96d9-064f53fe718a.png)\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26871415/168449037-62ccfa8b-6e91-4cbf-bd37-48087f2ce998.png)\n![gamepage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26871415/168449021-222673fd-675a-4a17-9e5b-907d99919e11.png)\n\n[![jump](https://img.shields.io/badge/Back%20to%20top-%20?style=flat&color=grey&logo=data:image/svg%2bxml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjRweCIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDI0IDI0IiB3aWR0aD0iMjRweCIgZmlsbD0iI0ZGRkZGRiI+PHBhdGggZD0iTTAgMGgyNHYyNEgwVjB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZD0iTTQgMTJsMS40MSAxLjQxTDExIDcuODNWMjBoMlY3LjgzbDUuNTggNS41OUwyMCAxMmwtOC04LTggOHoiLz48L3N2Zz4=)](#heroic-games-launcher)\n"

Works in all major browsers and can be combined with your favorite js library.\n\n\n## Using Crafty\n\nA simple game of pong:\n```javascript\nCrafty.init(600, 300);\nCrafty.background('rgb(127,127,127)');\n\n//Paddles\nCrafty.e(\"Paddle, 2D, DOM, Color, Multiway\")\n    .color('rgb(255,0,0)')\n    .attr({ x: 20, y: 100, w: 10, h: 100 })\n    .multiway(200, { W: -90, S: 90 });\nCrafty.e(\"Paddle, 2D, DOM, Color, Multiway\")\n    .color('rgb(0,255,0)')\n    .attr({ x: 580, y: 100, w: 10, h: 100 })\n    .multiway(200, { UP_ARROW: -90, DOWN_ARROW: 90 });\n\n//Ball\nCrafty.e(\"2D, DOM, Color, Collision\")\n    .color('rgb(0,0,255)')\n    .attr({ x: 300, y: 150, w: 10, h: 10,\n            dX: Crafty.math.randomInt(2, 5),\n            dY: Crafty.math.randomInt(2, 5) })\n    .bind('UpdateFrame', function () {\n        //hit floor or roof\n        if (this.y <= 0 || this.y >= 290)\n            this.dY *= -1;\n\n        // hit left or right boundary\n        if (this.x > 600) {\n            this.x = 300;\n            Crafty(\"LeftPoints\").each(function () {\n                this.text(++this.points + \" Points\") });\n        }\n        if (this.x < 10) {\n            this.x = 300;\n            Crafty(\"RightPoints\").each(function () {\n                this.text(++this.points + \" Points\") });\n        }\n\n        this.x += this.dX;\n        this.y += this.dY;\n    })\n    .onHit('Paddle', function () {\n        this.dX *= -1;\n    });\n\n//Score boards\nCrafty.e(\"LeftPoints, DOM, 2D, Text\")\n    .attr({ x: 20, y: 20, w: 100, h: 20, points: 0 })\n    .text(\"0 Points\");\nCrafty.e(\"RightPoints, DOM, 2D, Text\")\n    .attr({ x: 515, y: 20, w: 100, h: 20, points: 0 })\n    .text(\"0 Points\");\n```\n_Left paddle is controlled by `W` & `S`, right paddle by `UpArrow` & `DownArrow`._   \n[Check it out online and try to modify it yourself here](https://jsfiddle.net/mucaho/yL3v48r6/).\n\n## Developing\n\nIf you want to fix a bug, please submit a pull request against the development branch.  Some guides to help you can be found [on the wiki](https://github.com/craftyjs/Crafty/wiki)\n\nIf you would like to make larger contributions please catch us in the [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/craftyjs) and we will help you get started. Much appreciated :-)\n\n\n### Quick build instructions\n\nThe easiest way to build crafty is to use [gruntjs](http://gruntjs.com/), which requires [node](nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/).  If you have grunt, node, and npm already installed, then run `npm install` from Crafty's root directory.  (This will pull down about 30MB of node packages.)  From then on, just run `grunt` to build.\n\nYou can also use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of npm.\n\n([Full instructions here](https://github.com/craftyjs/Crafty/wiki/Building).)\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Using Deep Q Networks to Learn Video Game Strategies\n#### Nikita Srivatsan, Ivan Kuznetsov, Willis Wang\n\n## 1. Abstract\n\nIn this project, we apply a deep learning model recently developed by Minh et al 2015 [1] to learn optimal control patterns from visual input using reinforcement learning. While this method is highly generalizable, we applied it to the problem of video game strategy, specifically for Pong and Tetris. Given raw pixel values from the screen, we used a convolutional neural network trained with Q learning to approximate future expected reward for any possible action, and then selected an action based on the best possible outcome. We find that this method is capable of generalizing to new problems with no adjustment of the model architecture. After sufficient training, our Pong model achieved better than human performance on the games, demonstrating the potential for deep learning as a powerful and generalizable method for learning high-level control schemes.\n\n## 2. Background\n\nReinforcement learning develops control patterns by providing feedback on a model\u2019s selected actions, which encourages the model to select better actions in the future. At each time step, given some state s, the model will select an action a, and then observe the new state s' and a reward r based on some optimality criterion.\n\nWe specifically used a method known as Q learning, which approximates the maximum expected return for performing an action at a given state using an action-value (Q) function. Specifically, return gives the sum of the rewards until the game terminates, where the reward is discounted by a factor of \u03b3 at each time step. We formally define this as:\n\n![alt-text](http://imgur.com/h7MJxSJ.png \"(1)\")\n\nWe then define the action-value function:\n\n![alt-text](http://imgur.com/05MxGxk.png \"(2)\")\n\nNote that if the optimal Q function is known for state s', we can write the optimal Q function at preceding state s as the maximum expected value of ![alt-text](http://imgur.com/1RSOCHo.png \"Sorry, no alt-text for this one\"). This identity is known as the Bellman equation:\n\n![alt-text](http://imgur.com/BERyjr2.png \"(3)\")\n\nThe intuition behind reinforcement learning is to continually update the action-value function based on observations using the Bellman equation. It has been shown by Sutton et al 1998 [2] that such update algorithms will converge on the optimal action-value function as time approaches infinity. Based on this, we can define Q as the output of a neural network, which has weights \u03b8, and train this network by minimizing the following loss function at each iteration i:\n\n![alt-text](http://imgur.com/3gFka35.png \"(4)\")\n\nWhere y_i represents the target function we want to approach during each iteration. It is defined as:\n\n![alt-text](http://imgur.com/gKcXJfi.png \"(5)\")\n\nNote that when i is equal to the final iteration of an episode (colloquially the end of a game), the Q function should be 0 since it is impossible to attain additional reward after the game has ended. Therefore, when i equals the terminal frame of an episode, we can simply write:\n\n![alt-text](http://imgur.com/nU8qRJM.png \"(6)\")\n\n## 3. Related Work\n\nTraditional approaches use an array to approximate the action-value function. However, this method does not scale well as the complexity of the system increases. Tesauro 1995 [3] proposed TD-Gammon, a method of using a multilayer perceptron with one hidden layer. This method worked well on the backgammon game, but failed to generalize to new problems.\n\nMore recently Riedmiller 2005 [4] used a system called neural-fitted Q learning, which used a multilayer perceptron to approximate the Q function. However, the approach had issues as it trained in batch updates with cost proportional to the size of the dataset, which limits the scalability of the system. Also, the tasks which Riedmiller considered had a very low dimensional state space. For the problem of video games, however, it is necessary to consider incredibly high dimensional visual input, and not allow our system to know anything about the internal game state or the rules of the game.\n\nMinh et al 2015 [1] proposed deep Q learning, where a deep convolutional neural network is used to calculate the Q function. Convolutional neural networks are particularly well suited to the visual state space of video games. Furthermore, they also proposed a new method for training the network. While online approaches have a tendency to diverge or overfit, and training on the entire dataset is quite costly, Minh et al 2015 trained on minibatches sampled from a replay memory. The replay memory contains all previously seen state transitions, and the associated action and reward. At each time step a minibatch of transitions is sampled from the replay memory and the loss function described above is minimized for that batch with respect to the network weights.\n\nThis approach carries many advantages in addition to the aforementioned computational cost benefits. By using a replay memory, each experience can be used in multiple updates, which means that the data is being used more effectively. Also, using an online approach has the disadvantage that all consecutive updates will be over highly correlated states. This can cause the network to get stuck in a poor local optimum, or to diverge dramatically. Using a batched approach over more varied experiences smooths out the updates and avoids this problem.\n\n## 4. Deep Q Learning Algorithm\n\nThe pseudo-code for the Deep Q Learning algorithm, as given in [1], can be found below:\n\n```\nInitialize replay memory D to size N\nInitialize action-value function Q with random weights\nfor episode = 1, M do\n\tInitialize state s_1\n\tfor t = 1, T do\n\t\tWith probability \u03f5 select random action a_t\n\t\totherwise select a_t=argmax_a  Q(s_t,a; \u03b8_i)\n\t\tExecute action a_t in emulator and observe r_t and s_(t+1)\n\t\tStore transition (s_t,a_t,r_t,s_(t+1)) in D\n\t\tSample a minibatch of transitions (s_j,a_j,r_j,s_(j+1)) from D\n\t\tSet y_j:=\n\t\t\tr_j for terminal s_(j+1)\n\t\t\tr_j+\u03b3*max_(a^' )  Q(s_(j+1),a'; \u03b8_i) for non-terminal s_(j+1)\n\t\tPerform a gradient step on (y_j-Q(s_j,a_j; \u03b8_i))^2 with respect to \u03b8\n\tend for\nend for\n```\n\n## 5. Experimental Methods\n\nThe network was trained on the raw pixel values observed from the game at each time step. We preprocessed the images by converting to grayscale, resizing them to 80x80, and then stacked together the last four frames to produce an 80x80x4 input array.\n\nThe architecture of the network is described in Figure 1 below. The first layer convolves the input image with an 8x8x4x32 kernel at a stride size of 4. The output is then put through a 2x2 max pooling layer. The second layer convolves with a 4x4x32x64 kernel at a stride of 2. We then max pool again. The third layer convolves with a 3x3x64x64 kernel at a stride of 1. We then max pool one more time. The last hidden layer consists of 256 fully connected ReLU nodes.\n\n![alt-text](http://imgur.com/mfatQrY.png \"Figure 1\")\n\nThe output layer, obtained with a simple matrix multiplication, has the same dimensionality as the number of valid actions which can be performed in the game, where the 0th index always corresponds to doing nothing. The values at this output layer represent the Q function given the input state for each valid action. At each time step, the network performs whichever action corresponds to the highest Q value using a \u03f5 greedy policy.\n\nAt startup, we initialize all weight matrices randomly using a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0.01. Bias variables are all initialized at 0.01. We then initialize the replay memory with a max size of 500,000 observations.\n\nWe start training by choosing actions uniformly at random for 50,000 time steps, without updating the network weights. This allows us to populate the replay memory before training begins. After that, we linearly anneal \u03f5 from 1 to 0.1 over the course of the next 500,000 frames. During this time, at each time step, the network samples minibatches of size 100 from the replay memory to train on, and performs a gradient step on the loss function described above using the Adam optimization algorithm with a learning rate of 0.000001. After annealing finishes, the network continues to train indefinitely, with \u03f5 fixed at 0.1.\n\nAn Amazon Web Services G2 large instance was used to efficiently conduct training on a GPU. We implemented the DQN in Google\u2019s newly released TensorFlow library.\n\n## 6. Results\n\nSee these links for videos of the DQN in action:\n\n[DQN playing a long game of Pong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE_KKM0e38s)\n\n[Visualization of convolutional layers and Q function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9jGIzkVCsM)\n\nWe found that for Pong, good results were achieved after approximately 1.38 million time steps, which corresponds to about 25 hours of game time. Qualitatively, the network played at the level of an experienced human player, usually beating the game with a score of 20-2. Figure 2 shows the maximum Q value for the first ~20,000 training steps. To minimize clutter, only maximum Q values corresponding to the first 100 training steps of each consecutive group of 1,250 training steps are shown. As can be seen, the maximum Q value increases over time. This indicates improvement as it means that the network is expecting to receive a greater reward per game as it trains for longer. In theory, as we continue to train the network, the value of the maximum Q value should plateau as the network reaches an optimal state.\n\n![alt-text](http://imgur.com/rnLVmyd.png \"Figure 2\")\n\nThe final hidden representation of the input image frames in the network was a 256 dimensional vector. Figure 3 shows t-SNE embedding of ~1,200 such representations which were sampled over a period of 2 hours with fixed network weights which had been learned after 25 hours of training. The points in the visualization were also color-coded based on the maximum Q values at the output layer for that frame.\n\n![alt-text](http://imgur.com/hCj7BCG.png \"Figure 3\")\n\nThe network controlled paddle is on the left and highlighted yellow for easy visualization. The paddle controlled by the \u201copponent,\u201d a hard-coded AI built into the game, is on the right. As can be seen from the image frames, high maximum Q-values correspond to when the ball was near the opponent's paddle, so the network had a high probability of scoring. Similarly, low maximum Q-values correspond to when the ball was near the network's paddle, so the network had an increased chance of losing the points. When the ball is in the center of the court, a neutral maximum Q value occurs.\n\nWe are also currently actively working on getting the system to learn Tetris as well. This section will be updated as further progress in this direction is made.\n\n## 7. Conclusions\n\nWe utilized deep Q learning to train a neural network to play Pong and partially to play Tetris from just images of the current game screen and no knowledge of the internal game state. Qualitatively, the trained Pong network appeared to perform near human level. We are still working on training the system to play Tetris, and will hopefully report good results in the near future.\n\nWe then went on to show that the Pong network has a relatively high level \u201cunderstanding\u201d of the current state of the game. For example, the Pong network\u2019s function was maximized when the ball was near the opponent's paddle, when it would be reasonable to expect a point. However, it was minimized when the ball was near the network\u2019s paddle, as there was a chance it could lose the point.\n\nSignificant improvements on the current network architecture are possible. For example, our implementation of max pooling may have been unnecessary, as it caused the convolution kernels in the deeper layers to have a size comparable to that of the previous layer itself. Hence, max pooling may have discarded useful information. Given more time, it would be nice to perform more tuning over the various network parameters, such as the learning rate, the batch size, the replay memory, and the lengths of the observation and exploration phases. Additionally, we could check the performance of the network if the game parameters are tweaked (e.g. the angle of the ball\u2019s bounce is changed slightly). This would yield important information about the network\u2019s ability to extrapolate to new situations.\n\nBased on the difference in results between Tetris and Pong, we should also expect the system to converge faster for games which provide rewards (either positive or negative) very frequently, even while the network is acting randomly. This leads us to believe that while our system should theoretically be able to learn any game, it might achieve human-level performance faster for genres like fighting games or other similar types in which the game score changes rapidly over a short amount of time. This might be another interesting future direction to explore.\n\nUltimately, the results obtained here demonstrate the usefulness of convolutional neural networks to perform deep Q learning as proposed in [1]. However, we have only applied these methods to relatively simple games; CNNs have also been used in much more complex image processing and object recognition. This would indicate that we can apply similar techniques to those described here to much more challenging tasks. Further research well undoubtedly lead to interesting results in this field.\n\n## 8.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask. It's also a good place to just keep up with the emulator, as most talk regarding development goes on over there.\n\n---\n\n### Special Thanks\nA few noteworthy teams/projects who've helped us along the way are:\n* **[Ryujinx](https://ryujinx.org/):** We've used Ryujinx for reference throughout the project, the accuracy of their HLE implementations of Switch subsystems make it an amazing reference. The team behind the project has been extremely helpful with any queries we've had and have constantly helped us with any issues we've come across. **It should be noted that Skyline is not based on Ryujinx**.\n\n* **[yuzu](https://yuzu-emu.org/):** Skyline's shader compiler is a **fork** of *yuzu*'s shader compiler with Skyline-specific changes, using it allowed us to focus on the parts of GPU emulation that we could specifically optimize for mobile while having a high-quality shader compiler implementation as a base. The team behind *yuzu* has also often helped us and have graciously provided us with a license exemption.\n\n* **[Switchbrew](https://github.com/switchbrew/):** We've extensively used Switchbrew whether that be their **[wiki](https://switchbrew.org/)** with its colossal amount of information on the Switch that has saved us countless hours of time or **[libnx](https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx)** which was crucial to initial development of the emulator to ensure that our HLE kernel and sysmodule implementations were accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Disclaimer\n* **Nintendo Switch** is a trademark of **Nintendo Co., Ltd**\n* **Android** is a trademark of **Google LLC**\n"

  "readme_contents": "PathFinding.js\n==============\n#### A comprehensive path-finding library in javascript. ####\n\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/qiao/PathFinding.js?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/qiao/PathFinding.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/qiao/PathFinding.js)\n[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/qiao/pathfinding.js.png)](https://david-dm.org/qiao/pathfinding.js)\n[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pathfindingjs/badge/)](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pathfindingjs/?badge=latest)\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nThe aim of this project is to provide a path-finding library that can be easily incorporated into web games. It may run on Node.js or the browser.\n\nIt comes along with an [online demo](http://qiao.github.com/PathFinding.js/visual) to show how the algorithms execute. (The pathfinding speed is slowed down in the demo)\n\nNote that this project only provides path-finding algorithms for 2D space. If you need to work in a 3D environment, then you may use [@schteppe](https://github.com/schteppe)'s [fork](https://github.com/schteppe/PathFinding3D.js).\n\nThere is new documentation being written for PathFinding.js. You can read it [here](http://pathfindingjs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). Note that this is in very early stages and far from complete so keep your eyes open for mistakes and don't hesitate to open a pull request in case you find one.\n\nServer\n------\n\nIf you want to use it in Node.js, you may install it via `npm`.\n\n```bash\nnpm install pathfinding\n```\n\nThen, in your program:\n\n```javascript\nvar PF = require('pathfinding');\n```\n\nSee the `Basic Usage` section below for usage details.\n\n\nBrowser\n-------\n\nIf you have bower installed then you can install it with the following command:\n\n```bash\nbower install pathfinding\n```\n\nBy default bower will install pathfinding under the bower_components folder, so to include it in your page do something like:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"path/to/bower_components/pathfinding/pathfinding-browser.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nYou can also grab a release from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/imor/pathfinding-bower/releases) if you don't use bower.\n\nBasic Usage\n-----------\n\nTo build a grid-map of width 5 and height 3:\n\n```javascript\nvar grid = new PF.Grid(5, 3); \n```\n\nBy default, all the nodes in the grid will be able to be walked through.\nTo set whether a node at a given coordinate is walkable or not, use the `setWalkableAt` method.\n\nFor example, to set the node at (0, 1) to be un-walkable, where 0 is the x coordinate (from left to right), and \n1 is the y coordinate (from up to down):\n\n```javascript\ngrid.setWalkableAt(0, 1, false);\n```\n\nYou may also pass in a matrix while instantiating the `PF.Grid` class.\nIt will initiate all the nodes in the grid with the same walkability indicated by the matrix.\n0 for walkable while 1 for blocked.\n\n```javascript\nvar matrix = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n];\nvar grid = new PF.Grid(matrix);\n```\n\nCurrently there are 10 path-finders bundled in this library, namely:\n\n*  `AStarFinder` *\n*  `BestFirstFinder`\n*  `BreadthFirstFinder` *\n*  `DijkstraFinder` *\n*  `IDAStarFinder.js` *\n*  `JumpPointFinder` *\n*  `OrthogonalJumpPointFinder` *\n*  `BiAStarFinder`\n*  `BiBestFirstFinder`\n*  `BiBreadthFirstFinder` *\n*  `BiDijkstraFinder` *\n\nThe prefix `Bi` for the last four finders in the above list stands for the bi-directional searching strategy.\n\nAlso, Note that only the finders with trailing asterisks are guaranteed to find the shortest path.\n\nTo build a path-finder, say, the `AStarFinder`:\n\n```javascript\nvar finder = new PF.AStarFinder();\n```\n\nTo find a path from (1, 2) to (4, 2), (Note: both the start point and end point should be walkable):\n\n```javascript\nvar path = finder.findPath(1, 2, 4, 2, grid);\n```\n\n`path` will be an array of coordinates including both the start and end positions.\n\nFor the `matrix` defined previously, the `path` will be:\n\n```javascript\n[ [ 1, 2 ], [ 1, 1 ], [ 2, 1 ], [ 3, 1 ], [ 3, 2 ], [ 4, 2 ] ]\n```\n\nBe aware that `grid` will be modified in each path-finding, and will not be usable afterwards. If you want to use a single grid multiple times, create a clone for it before calling `findPath`.\n\n```javascript\nvar gridBackup = grid.clone();\n```\n\n\nAdvanced Usage\n--------------\n\nWhen instantiating path-finders, you may pass in additional parameters to indicate which specific strategies to use.\n\nFor all path-finders, you may indicate whether diagonal movement is allowed. The default value is `false`, which means that the path can only go orthogonally.\n\nIn order to enable diagonal movement:\n\n```javascript\nvar finder = new PF.AStarFinder({\n    allowDiagonal: true\n});\n```\n\nWhen diagonal movement is enabled, you might want to prevent the path from touching the corners of the occupied grid blocks. This is usually desirable if the objects using the path have physical width and can also move between the grid cells.\n\nTo enable the corner crossing prevention:\n\n```javascript\nvar finder = new PF.AStarFinder({\n    allowDiagonal: true,\n    dontCrossCorners: true\n});\n```\n\nNote that `dontCrossCorners` only makes sense when `allowDiagonal` is also used. Currently all algorithms except `JumpPointFinder` support this feature.\n\nFor `AStarFinder`, `BestFirstFinder` and all their `Bi` relatives, you may indicate which heuristic function to use.\n\nThe predefined heuristics are `PF.Heuristic.manhattan`(default), `PF.Heuristic.chebyshev`, `PF.Heuristic.euclidean` and `PF.Heuristic.octile`.\n\nTo use the chebyshev heuristic:\n\n```javascript\nvar finder = new PF.AStarFinder({\n    heuristic: PF.Heuristic.chebyshev\n});\n```\n\nTo build a `BestFirstFinder` with diagonal movement allowed and a custom heuristic function:\n\n```javascript\nvar finder = new PF.BestFirstFinder({\n    allowDiagonal: true,\n    heuristic: function(dx, dy) {\n        return Math.min(dx, dy);\n    }\n});\n```\n\nTo smoothen the path, you may use `PF.Util.smoothenPath`. This routine will return\na new path with the original one unmodified.\n\n```javascript\nvar newPath = PF.Util.smoothenPath(grid, path);\n```\n\nNote that the new path will be compressed as well, i.e. if the original path is\n`[[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4]]`, then the new path will be `[[0, 1], [0, 4]]`.\n\nTo just compress a path without smoothing it, you may use `PF.Util.compressPath`.\n\n```javascript\nvar newPath = PF.Util.compressPath(path);\n```\n\nTo expand the compressed path like `[[0, 1], [0, 4]]` back to `[[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4]]`,\nyou may use `PF.Util.expandPath`.\n\n```javascript\nvar newPath = PF.Util.expandPath(path);\n```\n\n\nDevelopment\n------------\n\nLayout:\n\n    .\n    |-- lib          # browser distribution\n    |-- src          # source code (algorithms only)\n    |-- test         # test scripts\n    |-- utils        # build scripts\n\t|-- benchmark    # benchmarks\n    `-- visual       # visualization\n\nMake sure you have `node.js` installed, then use `npm` to install the dependencies: \n\n    npm install -d \n\nThe build system uses gulp, so make sure you have it installed:\n\n    npm install -d -g gulp\n\nTo build the browser distribution:\n\n    gulp compile\n\nTo run the tests\n(algorithms only, not including the visualization) with\n[mocha](http://mochajs.org/) and [should.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js)\nFirst install mocha:\n\n    npm install -d -g mocha\n\nThen run the tests:\n\n    gulp test\n\nTo run the benchmarks:\n\n    gulp bench\n\nOr if you are feeling lazy, the default gulp task does everything(except running the benchmarks):\n\n    gulp\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n[MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\n\n&copy; 2011-2012 Xueqiao Xu &lt;xueqiaoxu@gmail.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

  "readme_contents": "# PythonStdioGames\n\nA collection of Python 3 source code for simple, text-based games & simulations to use as example programs.\n\nINSTALL: `pip install --user gamesbyexample`\n\n(Use `pip3` on macOS and Linux.)\n\nRUN LAUNCHER: `python -m gamesbyexample`\n\nI'm not accepting pull requests currently, but feel free to leave comments or send suggestions to al@inventwithpython.com\n\nIf you need help installing Python, visit https://installpython3.com/\n\n\nI Just Found This Web Page, How Do I Play These Games?\n======================================================\n\nFirst, install [the Python interpreter](https://python.org). This comes with the barebones IDLE editor. There are other editors you can use. On Windows, you can also use the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor. [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) is an editor for Windows, Linux, and macOS. You can also use a browser-based editor like [REPL.it](https://repl.it/). These are all free.\n\nThen, click in the `src` and `gamesbyexample` folders in this repo to find the `.py` files of various Python games. For example, this is the code for [snailrace.py](https://github.com/asweigart/PythonStdioGames/blob/master/src/gamesbyexample/snailrace.py). The code for each game its entirely in one `.py` file, so you can copy the code directly into your editor. I recommend typing it in by hand, rather than using copy-paste. This will give you \"muscle memory\" of each part of the code. (Though some of these games require you download a data file into the same folder as your `.py` file.) Then you can run the program. If you get error messages, note the line number in the error message and check for typos you've made.\n\nAfter learning basic syntax, many programmers want to move on to the next step and see how these programming concepts are used in \"real\" programs. Most open source projects are far too large and complicated. These games have been designed to be short, simple, and fun. You can use them as learning examples to see how to make your own programs.\n\nNote that some programs require you to download an extra file from this repo. For example, the `[sudoku.py](https://github.com/asweigart/PythonStdioGames/blob/master/src/gamesbyexample/sudoku.py)` game loads its puzzles from the `[sudokupuzzles.txt](https://github.com/asweigart/PythonStdioGames/blob/master/src/gamesbyexample/sudokupuzzles.txt)` file.\n\n\nAbout this Collection\n=====================\n\nAfter beginners learn the syntax of Python and basic programming concepts (loops, branching, functions, etc.) they often hit a dead-end: \"How do I become better at programming?\" At this point, people will tell them to work on their own practice projects (which leaves them without guidance on what to make and how to make it) or to contribute to open source projects (which can be difficult to find, understand its code base, and get guidance on how to contribute).\n\nWhat helped me learn to code was finding small projects whose source code I copied and then made small adjustments to. This gave me insight on how loops, branching, and functions combined together into actual programs.\n\nTo help others down the same path, I'm creating a collection of example programs aimed at being easy to copy and understand by beginners. These programs (mostly games) have the following constraints:\n\n* They're short, with a limit of 256 lines of code. *This makes them easy to read and understand in one sitting. The shorter the better. The \"256\" number was arbitrarily selected, but this also means programs will fit on 4 or 5 printed pages.*\n* They fit into a single source code file and have no installer. *This makes these games trivial to share by copy/pasting code to a pastebin site. Data/image/save files can be used, but the source should link to some examples in their comments.*\n* They only use the Python standard library. *Fewer things to install means wider compatibility and less chance of failing during environment setup.*\n* They only use stdio text; `print()` and `input()` in Python. *The output being in the same text medium as the text source code makes it less abstract, and easier to see the cause-effect relationship between code and output. This means there's no graphics or mouse input, but makes it simple to port these programs to other languages since they all support stdio text.*\n* They're necessarily turn-based. *Relying on `input()` means the program must wait for the user to enter text, but this means we can't have real-time programs that respond to single key-presses.*\n* They're well commented. *Comments should be aimed at beginners and will be more verbose. The 256-line limit includes comments and whitespace. If the program is too long to include abundant comments and sensible whitespace, the program should be simplified, not the comments.*\n* They use as few programming concepts as possible. *If classes, list comprehensions, recursion, aren't necessary for the program, then they are't used.*\n* **Elegant** and **efficient** code is worthless next to code that is **easy to understand** and **readable**. *These programs are for education, not production. Standard best practices, like not using global variables, can be ignored to make it easier to understand.*\n* They do input validation and are bug free. *It should be impossible to crash a program with bad input or an edge case.*\n* All functions have docstrings. *This is good documentation practice, but also enables the `help()` function to work in the interactive shell.*\n\n\nAdditional Guidelines\n=====================\n\nAdditional guidelines include:\n\n* Don't use f-strings. Raspberry Pis as of 2019 have Python 3.5 installed, and f-strings only came about in 3.6. One guideline for these programs is to be as widely compatible as possible.\n* Some of these programs use the `bext` module, which adds curses-like features like color, clearing the screen, and moving the cursor\n* Include a link to a run-through of the program on https://pythontutor.com so that the student can see how the program runs.\n* Longer, more descriptive variable names are better than shorter ones. Avoid using single-letter variable names except for `i` and `j`, or `x` and `y`.\n* Have comments marked as `# (!)` that describe minor changes that they can make (increasing health, changing difficulty, etc.)\n* Use jsdifflib to create online diffs. *This is an easy way for students to find their own typos when copying the code. An example is here: https://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/diff/*\n* Use `assert` statements to catch common typos the student makes when typing in the code, especially for constants that they may modify.\n* Use Python 3. *The only time Python 2 is appropriate to use is when there's a large existing codebase. But this is for new programmers working on greenfield projects.*\n* Stick to characters in WGL4 character repertoire, which is basically CP 1252, code pages for Cyrillic/Greek/Turkish/Baltic characters, and the MS-DOS era CP437 \"extended ASCII\" encoding. *Windows' command line is the limiting factor here; it can't display all UTF-8 characters.*\n* The source code must be typeable. *Don't put box-drawing or extended ascii characters directly into the source code, but rather make chr() calls instead to acquire these characters.*\n* Time can be a factor, even if the programs aren't real-time. *You can check for time or add pauses in between calls to `input()`, but note that you'll never be able to interrupt when the user is typing.*\n* The `pyperclip` module can be used to interact with the clipboard. *Large amounts of text can be input-ed into or output-ed from the program using the clipboard.*\n* I use %s string interpolation instead of f-strings. *I love f-strings, but they were only introduced in Python 3.6 and I don't want to limit the versions that these programs are compatible with.*\n* For all dictionaries, I have a short comment explaining what types the keys and values are. *For example, # Keys=places, values=strings of the suspect & item there.*\n* Use the \"DOS box-drawing\" characters to draw complicated board games. *Though sticking to +, -, and | for lines is good too since it's simpler.*\n* Player vs player games can often be simpler and shorter than player vs computer games. *This necessarily means that multiplayer games must be \"perfect information\" games since both players can view the screen.*\n* Don't modify mutable objects (e.g. lists) in functions to pass information into/out of the function; only use parameters and return values. *This can make your program seem magical to someone not familiar with the Python Data Model.*\n* Avoid insulting the player when they lose. *This is something I learned from instructing programming classes for kids. They respond poorly to messages like, \"Game Over, Dummy!\" even if they seem innocuous to adults.*\n\nAfter making several of these programs, I've notice various \"categories\" of program complexity. Programs can be of zero or more of these categories:\n\n* Absolute beginner level. *No functions, no nested data structures, avoid nested loops. Just uses simple branching and loops.*\n* Choose-your-own-adventure level. *Programs don't model things with data structures, but rather mostly use flow control.*\n* STDIO-only. *You can't undo things that have been previously printed (aside from \"printing\" backspace characters to erase characters on the current line). The output is like an append-only log file.*\n* Curses-like. *Requires the `bext` module, but can clear/refresh the screen, draw at arbitrary places on the screen in color, etc.*\n* Modify source code to run. *Instead of getting input from `input()`, the user edits variables at the top of the file to change the settings in the program.*\n\n\nAdditional modules I recommend using:\n\n* `bext` for colorful text and controlling the positioning of the text cursor.\n* `blessings` for a better version of curses.\n* `pyperclip` for copying/pasting text with the clipboard.\n* `playsound` for playing audio files.\n* `pyttsx3` for text to speech.\n* `pytextcavas` for 2D strings you can draw on\n* `pyrect` for rectangle data structure\n* `pybresenham` for various line-drawing functions\n\n\nCompleted Programs in This Collection\n=====================================\n\n*Alphabetize Quiz* - A time-based quiz game to see how fast you can alphabetize letters.\n\n*Alphabetize Word Quiz* - A time-based quiz game to see how fast you can alphabetize words.\n\n*Analog Clock* - An analog clock animation.

The software is free, and includes an asset manager, level editor, sprite manager, environment editor, and publishing tools.  The source code is released under the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).\n\nAt the core of Effect Games is the *Effect Engine*, a JavaScript game engine which uses built-in browser technologies to render graphics.  Currently the engine uses classic DHTML, not the Canvas element nor WebGL.  For audio we use HTML5 whenever we can, but fall back to Flash where necessary (which is unfortunately a lot of the time).  The Effect Engine supports most browsers including Internet Explorer 6+, Firefox 3+, Safari 3+, Chrome 2+, Opera 9+, and all major platforms including Windows, Mac and Linux.\n\nThe Effect Engine was developed by [Joseph Huckaby](http://about.me/jhuckaby) in 2005.  He was dissatisfied with existing web game technologies that relied on 3rd party plugins, and set out to create a pure JavaScript game engine that would run in any browser.  A designer by training, [Min Chang](http://itsmin.com) provided a necessary creative perspective to the development and use of Effect Game's tools.

All mods of any kind must also be disabled.\n- Follow the new issue template and remove any unnecessary text, but **please leave all formatting intact**. Include the title ID in all caps in the title of the issue; see existing issues for examples.\n- Search for a game first before adding a new issue; if you find an existing issue that is out of date, reply to it with a copied/pasted new issue template. A curator will then edit the OP with your test data.\n\nWhen you update or add additional information in an issue, please reply to the issue indicating your changes.\n\nA curator will apply appropriate labels to the issue. Our criteria may be a tad more stringent than some other emulator compatibility lists (and this may eventually change one day) but, for now, see the status label cheat sheet.  \n\n**Status label cheat sheet**:\n- `status-playable` - Boots and plays without any crashes or gpu bugs of any kind, and at a speed fast enough to reasonably enjoy on an average PC. \n- `status-ingame` - Boots and goes in-game but suffers from one or more of the following: crashes, deadlocks, gpu bugs, distractingly bad audio, or is simply too slow. Game still might able to be played all the way through, but not as the game is intended to play.\n- `status-menus` - Boots and goes past the title screen but does not make it into main gameplay.\n- `status-boots` - Boots but does not make it past the title screen.\n- `status-nothing` - Does not boot/shows no signs of life.\n"

file, commit and create a Pull Request.\n\nRemember to include:\n\n* working link (and its nicer version), e.g. `[immunology-fps.edu](https://immunology-fps.edu)`\n* field of science or engineering, e.g. `immunology`\n* type of game `first-person shooter`\n* (optional) technology or system, e.g. `Android, iOS, web`\n* (optional) link to additional materials (e.g. repo, some interesting blog post about this game)\n\nA game needs to fit this category and it needs to have science-based mechanics (not only theme!) as its major part as:\n\n> Any sufficiently advanced game is indistinguishable from a science-based game. - [PM, HN comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14662356)\n\nAlso, for games from typical genres, the bar is much higher. It is not enough that \"you learn about ancient warfare\" or \"you explore outer space\".\nAs a rule of thumb, mainstream games don't fit here (with the exception of Kerbal Space Program).\n\nWhen a game is free ([as in freedom, not price](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)), the license and code repository will be stated when possible. Please note that unless otherwise stated, the game is proprietary *or* a license can't be found.\n\n#### Form\n\nIf you want to change its form, you are invited as well - but then create your fork (and I would be happy to hear about it!).\n\nAll remarks, questions or discussions go to https://github.com/stared/science-based-games-list/issues/ (or [@pmigdal Twitter](https://twitter.com/pmigdal)).\n\n### Ideas\n\n* Do it in YAML? (To make it more semantic.)\n* Make it more visual? (In the line of https://github.com/EliotAndres/kaggle-past-solutions.)\n* Add other fields like release date or dev status?\n* Add some standardized (600x400?) screenshots?\n"

  "readme_contents": "# C1GamesStarterKit\n\nWelcome to the C1 Terminal Starter Kit! The repository contains a collection of scripts and \nlanguage-specific starter algos, to help you start your journey to develop the ultimate algo.\n\nFor more details about competitions and the game itself please check out our\n[main site](https://terminal.c1games.com/rules).\n\n## Manual Play\n\nWe recommend you familiarize yourself with the game and its strategic elements, by playing manually,\nbefore you start your algo. Check out [the playground](https://terminal.c1games.com/playground).\n\n## Algo Development\n\nTo test your algo locally, you should use the test_algo_[OS] scripts in the scripts folder. Details on its use is documented in the README.md file in the scripts folder.\n\nFor programming documentation of language specific algos, see each language specific README.\nFor documentation of the game-config or the json format the engine uses to communicate the current game state, see json-docs.html\n\nFor advanced users you can install java and run the game engine locally. Java 10 or above is required: [Java Development Kit 10 or above](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk10-downloads-4416644.html).\n\nAll code provided in the starterkit is meant to be used as a starting point, and can be overwritten completely by more advanced players to improve performance or provide additional utility.\n\n## Windows Setup\n\nIf you are running Windows, you will need Windows PowerShell installed. This comes pre-installed on Windows 10.\nSome windows users might need to run the following PowerShell commands in adminstrator mode (right-click the \nPowerShell icon, and click \"run as administrator\"):\n    \n    `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`\n    \nIf this doesn't work try this:\n    \n    `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted CurrentUser`\n    \nIf that still doesn't work, try these below:\n    \n    `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`\n    `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`\n    \nAnd don't forget to run the PowerShell as admin.\n\n## Uploading Algos\n\nSimply select the folder of your algo when prompted on the [Terminal](https://terminal.c1games.com) website. Make sure to select the specific language folder such as \"python-algo\" do not select the entire starterkit itself.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nFor detailed troubleshooting help related to both website problems and local development check out [the troubleshooting section](https://terminal.c1games.com/rules#Troubleshooting).\n\n#### Python Requirements\n\nPython algos require Python 3 to run. If you are running Unix (Mac OS or Linux), the command `python3` must run on \nBash or Terminal. If you are running Windows, the command `py -3` must run on PowerShell.\n   \n#### Java Requirements\n\nJava algos require the Java Development Kit. Java algos also require [Gradle]\n(https://gradle.org/install/) for compilation.\n   \n## Running Algos\n\nTo run your algo locally or on our servers, or to enroll your algo in a competition, please see the [documentation \nfor the Terminal command line interface in the scripts directory](https://github.com/correlation-one/AIGamesStarterKit/tree/master/scripts)\n"

Have a look at the [documentation](https://heroiclabs.com/docs) and join the [developer community](https://forum.heroiclabs.com) for more info.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThe server is simple to setup and run for local development and can be deployed to any cloud provider. See the [deployment notes](#deployment) for recommendations on how to deploy the project for production. Nakama server requires CockroachDB or another Postgres wire-compatible server as it's database.\n\n### Docker\n\n<a href=\"https://heroiclabs.com/docs/install-docker-quickstart/\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Docker_%28container_engine%29_logo.png\" width=\"170\"></a>\n\nThe fastest way to run the server and the database is with Docker. Setup Docker and start the daemon.\n\n1. Set up a [docker-compose file](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/install-docker-quickstart/#using-docker-compose) and place it in a folder for your project.\n\n2. Run `docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml up` to download container images and run the servers.\n\nFor more detailed instructions have a look at our [Docker quickstart](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/install-docker-quickstart) guide.\n\nNakama Docker images are maintained on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/heroiclabs/nakama/tags) and [prerelease](https://hub.docker.com/r/heroiclabs/nakama-prerelease/tags) images are occasionally published for cutting edge features of the server.\n\n### Binaries\n\nYou can run the servers with native binaries for your platform.\n\n1. Download the server from our [releases](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama/releases) page and the [database](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/install-cockroachdb.html).\n\n2. Follow the database [instructions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/start-a-local-cluster.html#before-you-begin) to start it.\n\n3. Run a migration which will setup or upgrade the database schema:\n\n   ```shell\n   nakama migrate up --database.address \"root@127.0.0.1:26257\"\n   ```\n\n4. Start Nakama and connect to the database:\n\n   ```shell\n   nakama --database.address \"root@127.0.0.1:26257\"\n   ```\n\nWhen connected you'll see server output which describes all settings the server uses for [configuration](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/install-configuration).\n\n> {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2018-04-29T10:14:41.249+0100\",\"msg\":\"Node\",\"name\":\"nakama\",\"version\":\"2.0.0+7e18b09\",\"runtime\":\"go1.10.1\",\"cpu\":4} <br/>\n> {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2018-04-29T10:14:41.249+0100\",\"msg\":\"Database connections\",\"dsns\":[\"root@127.0.0.1:26257\"]} <br/>\n> ...\n\n## Usage\n\nNakama supports a variety of protocols optimized for various gameplay or app use cases. For request/response it can use GRPC or the HTTP1.1+JSON fallback (REST). For realtime communication you can use WebSockets or rUDP.\n\nFor example with the REST API to authenticate a user account with a device identifier.\n\n```shell\ncurl \"127.0.0.1:7350/v2/account/authenticate/device?create=true\" \\\n  --user \"defaultkey:\" \\\n  --data '{\"id\": \"someuniqueidentifier\"}'\n```\n\nResponse:\n\n> { <br>\n>     \"token\":\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE1MjQ5OTU2NDksInVpZCI6Ijk5Y2Q1YzUyLWE5ODgtNGI2NC04YThhLTVmMTM5YTg4MTgxMiIsInVzbiI6InhBb1RxTUVSdFgifQ.-3_rXNYx3Q4jKuS7RkxeMWBzMNAm0vl93QxzRI8p_IY\" <br>\n> }\n\nThere's a number of official [client libraries](https://github.com/heroiclabs) available on GitHub with [documentation](https://heroiclabs.com/docs). The current platform/language support includes: .NET (in C#), Unity engine, JavaScript, Java (with Android), Unreal engine, Godot, Defold, and Swift (with iOS). If you'd like to contribute a client or request one let us know.\n\n## Nakama Console\n\nThe server provides a web UI which teams can use to inspect various data stored through the server APIs, view lightweight service metrics, manage player data, update storage objects, restrict access to production with permission profiles, and gain visibility into realtime features like active multiplayer matches. There is no separate installation required as it is embedded as part of the single server binary.\n\nYou can navigate to it on your browser on [http://127.0.0.1:7351](http://127.0.0.1:7351).\n\n<img src=\".github/accounts.jpg?raw=true\" title=\"Account listing\" width=\"1024\" align=\"center\">\n<img src=\".github/status.jpg?raw=true\" title=\"Status view\" width=\"125\" align=\"left\">\n<img src=\".github/storage.jpg?raw=true\" title=\"Storage record view\" width=\"125\" align=\"left\">\n<img src=\".github/match.jpg?raw=true\" title=\"Running matches view\" width=\"125\" align=\"left\">\n<img src=\".github/users.jpg?raw=true\" title=\"Console users view\" width=\"125\" align=\"left\">\n<img src=\".github/modules.jpg?raw=true\" title=\"Loaded modules view\" width=\"125\">\n\n## Deployment\n\nNakama can be deployed to any cloud provider such as Google Cloud, Azure, AWS, Digital Ocean, Heroku, or your own private cloud. You should setup and provision separate nodes for Nakama and CockroachDB.\n\nThe recommended minimum production infrastructure for CockroachDB is outlined in [these docs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/recommended-production-settings.html#basic-hardware-recommendations) and Nakama can be run on instance types as small as \"g1-small\" on Google Cloud although we recommend a minimum of \"n1-standard-1\" in production. The specific hardware requirements will depend on what features of the server are used. Reach out to us for help and advice on what servers to run.\n\n### Heroic Cloud\n\nYou can support development, new features, and maintainance of the server by using the Heroic Labs' [Heroic Cloud](https://heroiclabs.com/heroic-cloud/) for deployment. This service handles the uptime, replication, backups, logs, data upgrades, and all other tasks involved with production server environments.\n\nHave a look at our [Heroic Cloud](https://heroiclabs.com/heroic-cloud/) service for more details.\n\n## Contribute\n\nThe development roadmap is managed as GitHub issues and pull requests are welcome. If you're interested to add a feature which is not mentioned on the issue tracker please open one to create a discussion or drop in and discuss it in the [community forum](https://forum.heroiclabs.com).\n\n### Simple Builds\n\nAll dependencies required for a build are vendored as part of the Go project. We recommend a modern release of the Go toolchain and do not store the codebase in the old GOPATH.\n\n1. Download the source tree.\n\n   ```shell\n   git clone \"https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama\" nakama\n   cd nakama\n   ```\n\n2. Build the project from source.\n\n   ```shell\n   go build -trimpath -mod=vendor\n   ./nakama --version\n   ```\n\n### Full Source Builds\n\nThe codebase uses Protocol Buffers, GRPC, GRPC-Gateway, and the OpenAPI spec as part of the project. These dependencies are generated as sources and committed to the repository to simplify builds for contributors.\n\nTo build the codebase and generate all sources follow these steps.\n\n1. Install the toolchain.\n\n   ```shell\n   go install \\\n       \"google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go\" \\\n       \"google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc\" \\\n       \"github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway\" \\\n       \"github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2\"\n   ```\n\n2. If you've made changes to the embedded Console.\n\n    ```shell\n    cd console/ui\n    ng serve\n    ```\n\n3. Re-generate the protocol buffers, gateway code and console UI.\n\n   ```shell\n   env PATH=\"$HOME/go/bin:$PATH\" go generate -x ./...\n   ```\n\n4. Build the codebase.\n\n   ```shell\n   go build -trimpath -mod=vendor\n   ```\n\n### License\n\nThis project is licensed under the [Apache-2 License](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama/blob/master/LICENSE).\n"

Sur Debian ou\nUbuntu, les seules d\u00e9pendances (autres que `bash`) sont les paquets `awk` et\n`gettext-base` (le premier \u00e9tant g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement install\u00e9 par d\u00e9faut). Certaines\nmissions ont des d\u00e9pendances additionnelles : elles seront annul\u00e9es si leurs\nd\u00e9pendances ne sont pas satisfaites. Sur Debian ou Ubuntu, lancez la commande\nsuivante pour installer toutes les d\u00e9pendances pour le jeu et les missions.\n```sh\n$ sudo apt install gettext-base man-db psmisc nano tree bsdmainutils x11-apps\n```\nConsultez le [manuel utilisateur](doc/user_manual.md) (en anglais) pour voir\ncomment installer les d\u00e9pendances sur d'autres syst\u00e8mes (macOS, BSD, ...).\n\nEn supposant que toutes les d\u00e9pendances sont install\u00e9es, vous pouvez essayer\nla derni\u00e8re version du jeu en lan\u00e7ant les deux commandes suivantes dans un\nterminal.\n```sh\n$ wget https://github.com/phyver/GameShell/releases/download/latest/gameshell.sh\n$ bash gameshell.sh\n```\nLa premi\u00e8re commande t\u00e9l\u00e9chargera la derni\u00e8re version du jeu sous la forme\nd'une archive auto-extractible, et la seconde commande initialisera et lancera\nle jeu \u00e0 partir de cette archive. Les instructions pour jouer sont donn\u00e9es\ndirectement dans le jeu.\n\nQuand vous quitterez le jeu (avec `control-d` ou la commande `gsh exit`) votre\nprogression sera sauvegard\u00e9e dans une nouvelle archive (nomm\u00e9e\n`gameshell-save.sh`).

This subpackage contains code that will run on both the server or browser and can be used\nas a building block for alternative UIs or applications.\n\n### Installation\n\n```sh\n$ npm install @smogon/calc\n```\n\nAlternatively, as [detailed below](#browser), if you are using `@smogon/calc` in the browser and want\na convenient way to get started, simply depend on a transpiled and minified version via [unpkg][5]:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/@smogon/calc/dist/data/production.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/@smogon/calc\"></script>\n```\n\n*In this example, the `@smogon/calc/data` code is included as well to fulfill the calc's data\nlayer requirement. Alternatively, a more fully-featured data layer such as [`@pkmn/data`][9] may\nbe used instead, see below.*\n\n### Usage\n\n`@smogon/calc` exports all of the data types required to perform a calculation. The `calculate`\nmethods require:\n\n- a `Generation` that contains information about which damage formula mechanics to apply and where\n  all of the data about the generation can be found.\n- attacker and defender `Pokemon` (note: only relevant attributes are required, everything else\n  should have sensible defaults). The `Pokemon` constructor also requires a `Generation` to provide\n  the Pok\u00e9mon's data for the generation.\n- the `Move` being used by the attacker (which also requires a `Generation` argument to scope the\n  move data to the particular generation).\n- (optionally) a `Field` object containing information about the state of each `Side`.\n\n`calculate` returns a `Result` object that contains methods for fetching damage rolls, ranges,\ndescriptions, recoil/drain information, etc.\n\n```ts\nimport {calculate, Generations, Pokemon, Move} from '@smogon/calc';\n\nconst gen = Generations.get(5); // alternatively: const gen = 5;\nconst result = calculate(\n  gen,\n  new Pokemon(gen, 'Gengar', {\n    item: 'Choice Specs',\n    nature: 'Timid',\n    evs: {spa: 252},\n    boosts: {spa: 1},\n  }),\n  new Pokemon(gen, 'Chansey', {\n    item: 'Eviolite',\n    nature: 'Calm',\n    evs: {hp: 252, spd: 252},\n  }),\n  new Move(gen, 'Focus Blast')\n);\n```\n\n`@smogon/calc` comes packaged with all of the data required for damage calculation - by default, it\nexposes this via its `Generations` object from `@smogon/calc/data`. As a shortcut, the `Generation`\nargument required by `calculate`, `Pokemon`, `Move` can instead simply be the generation *number*\n(eg. `5`), and it will handle getting that generations `Generation` object behind the scenes from\nthe data layer it ships with.\n\n**The data in `calc/data` must be kept in sync with Pok\u00e9mon Showdown. If there is an issue with the\ncalc's data, please fix it in the simulator first.** In general, you should probably not be\nmaking manual edits to any of the data files, and in the future, they are likely to be generated\nprogrammatically.\n\nIn some advanced use cases, you may wish to use a different data layer with the calculator. The\n`@smogon/calc/adaptable` entry point can be used with any data layer that implements the calc's\n`Generations` interface. This interface is a subset of [`@pkmn/data`][9]'s `Generations` interface,\nso `@pkmn/data` (which contains all competitively relevant data from Pok\u00e9mon Showdown) can be used\nwith the adaptable entry point for applications which want to avoid having two separate sets of the\nsame data shipped to users.\n\n```ts\nimport {Generations} from '@pkmn/data';\nimport {calculate, Pokemon, Move, Field} from '@smogon/calc/adaptable';\n\nconst gen = Generations.get(1);\nconst result = calculate(\n  new Pokemon(gen, 'Gengar'),\n  new Pokemon(gen, 'Vulpix'),\n  new Move(gen, 'Surf'),\n  new Field({defenderSide: {isLightScreen: true}})\n);\n```\n\n### Browser\n\nThe recommended way of using `@smogon/calc` in a web browser is to **configure your bundler**\n([Webpack][6], [Rollup][7], [Parcel][8], etc) to minimize it and package it with the rest of your\napplication. If you do not use a bundler, a convenience `production.min.js` is included in the\npackage. You simply need to depend on `./node_modules/@smogon/calc/production.min.js` in a `script`\ntag (which is what the unpkg shortcut above is doing), after which **`calc` will be\naccessible as a global.** You must also have a `Generations` implementation provided, you can either\ndepend on the calculator's data layer by depending on\n`./node_modules/@smogon/calc/data/production.min.js` (or `@smogon/calc/data` via unpkg), or you can\nuse an alternative data layer such as [`@pkmn/data`][9]. You must load your data layer\n**before** loading the calc:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"./node_modules/@smogon/calc/data/production.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"./node_modules/@smogon/calc/production.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n## UI\n\nThe [UI layer][2] is currently is written in vanilla JavaScript and HTML. To view the UI locally you\nfirst must install dependencies by running `npm install` at the top level and without `calc/`. This\nshould create a `node_modules/` folder under both the root directory and under `calc/`:\n\n```sh\n$ npm install\n$ cd calc && npm install\n```\n\nNext, run `node build` from the root directory of your clone of this repository. This should\nrun `npm run compile` in the `calc/` subdirectory to compile the `@smogon/calc` package from\nTypeScript to JavaScript that can be run in the browser, and then compile the 'templated' HTML\nand copy everything into the top-level `dist/` folder. To then view the UI, open `dist/index.html` -\nsimply double-clicking on the file from your operating system's file manager UI should open it in\nyour default browser.\n\n```sh\n$ node build\n$ open dist/index.html # open works on macOS, simply double-clicking the file on Windows/macOS works\n```\n\n**If you make changes to anything in `calc/`, you must run `node build` from the top level to\ncompile the files and copy them into `dist/` again. If you make changes to the HTML or JavaScript in\n`src/`you must run `node build view` before the changes will become visible in your browser**\n(`node build` also works, but it is slower, as it will compile `calc/` as well, which is\nunnecessary if you did not make any changes to that directory).\n\nBefore opening up a Pull Request, please ensure `npm test` passes:\n\n```sh\n$ npm test\n```\n\n### Import\n\nThis repository also houses an internal package under `import/` which is used for populating the\nPok\u00e9mon sets data (as well as data about random battle options) used by the UI. Before making\nchanges here you must run `npm install` from under the `import/` directory to install its\ndependencies as they are not installed by default. [`TASKS.md`][4] contains more information on\nhow to programmatically update sets.\n\n## Credits\n\nThis project was created by Honko and is primarily maintained by Austin.\n\n- Gens 1-6 were originally implemented by Honko.\n- The Omega Ruby / Alpha Sapphire update was done by gamut-was-taken and Austin.\n- The Gen 7 update was done by Austin.\n- The Gen 8 update was done by Austin and Kris.\n- Some CSS styling was contributed by Zarel to match the Pok\u00e9mon Showdown! theme.\n\nMany other contributors have added features or contributed bug fixes, please see the\n[full list of contributors](https://github.com/smogon/damage-calc/graphs/contributors).\n\n## License\n\nThis package is distributed under the terms of the [MIT License][3].\n\n  [0]: https://github.com/smogon/damage-calc\n  [1]: https://github.com/smogon/damage-calc/tree/master/calc\n  [2]: https://github.com/smogon/damage-calc/tree/master/src\n  [3]: https://github.com/smogon/damage-calc/blob/master/LICENSE\n  [4]: https://github.com/smogon/damage-calc/blob/master/TASKS.md\n  [5]: https://unpkg.com/\n  [6]: https://webpack.js.org/\n  [7]: https://rollupjs.org/\n  [8]: https://parceljs.org/\n  [9]: https://github.com/pkmn/ps/blob/master/data\n"

  "readme_contents": "[![maintained](https://img.shields.io/maintenance/yes/2021.svg)]()\n[![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)]()\n[![language count](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/count/GameTechDev/GTS-GamesTaskScheduler.svg)]()\n[![top language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/GameTechDev/GTS-GamesTaskScheduler.svg)]()\n\n# Intel Games Task Scheduler (GTS)\n\n> To the [documentation](https://gametechdev.github.io/GTS-GamesTaskScheduler/documentation/html/index.html).\n\n## Introduction\n\nGTS is a C++ task scheduling framework for multi-processor platforms. It is designed to let\ndevelopers express their applications in task parallelism and let the scheduling framework\nmaximize the physical parallelism on the available processors.\n\n### Key Goals\n\n* **Simple expression of task parallelism**\n* **Highly efficient scheduling**\n* **Easy to configure and extend**\n\n### Target Audience\n\nGTS is designed for the needs of current and future game engine developers. Typical engine developers employ a highly\ncustomized, platform-scalable task system (or job system) that provides dedicated worker threads\nexecuting thousands of concurrent tasks. These threads may also share resources with driver,\nnetworking, middleware, and video streaming threads, all working in synchronized concert to \ndeliver glitch-free real-time rendering on 60+ frames per second (FPS) applications. Future game\nengines will have to cope with more threads, more tasks, and potentially multiple\ninstruction-set-architectures (ISAs), all running on an ever-expanding hardware landscape. \n\nWe built GTS to be simple and friendly to game engine task system use cases. We want a framework\nthat allows the game development community to experiment with and learn from different scheduling\nalgorithms easily. We also want a framework that allows us to demonstrate state-of-the-art algorithms\non task scheduling. Finally, we want to encourage games to better express parallelism so they can\ncompute more cool stuff and enable richer PC gaming experiences!\n\n### Features\n\n* Easily integrate GTS into an existing game engine complete with low level platform \noverrides. Game engines support a wide variety of operating systems and hardware platforms,\nwith varying degrees of custom code and work-arounds. Since GTS cannot possibly\nsupport every work-around and corner case, we have simplified engine integration\nby allowing the developer to completely replace the GTS platform layer through\na configuration file (user_config.h). \n* Express high-level program flow with persistent, dynamic task DAGs that can be\nexecuted homogeneously or heterogeneously with the Macro-Scheduler\n* Jump right into parallelism with predefined Parallel Patterns\n* Easily communicate between threads with Parallel Containers\n* Carve up CPU resources as you see fit with the WorkerPool\n* Express low-level algorithms and highly efficient execution policies with the Micro-scheduler\nand Task constructs.\n* Remove bottlenecks around heap access with gts_malloc.\n* Avoid contention and kernel-mode synchronization with GTS's user-mode synchronization primitives and contention \nreducing constructs.\n* OS-header-free and mostly STL-free interface. GTS won't pollute your engine with unnecessary headers.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n"

Lucky Doge [generously provided the results that he had made a lot of hard work](https://github.com/FurryGamesIndex/games/blob/master/luckydoge.txt), making it possible for this project to quickly develop into a practical list. The project pays more attention to maintainability, encourages community participation, provides convenient infrastructure for community participation and improves ease of use (such as tagging and search functions), and may also do voting and discussion in the future.\n\nIn this project, each game is structured in a independent YAML file.

  "readme_contents": "\nPutting game servers in Docker containers. Because it makes life easier.\n\nA set of game servers that have been wrapped with Docker. All images are\ncomposed of other images in this repository, except for base. Most images\nwill auto-download any dependencies they have (eg, factorio server files\nor sourcemod for srcds), making it almost one command to install a server.\nNo binaries are stored in this repo, so make sure you have internet to\ndownload them with.\n\nIncludes a utility script `start_server.sh` which mounts save data to an\nexternal volume and sorts out networking for you.\n\n## Quick start\n\nAssuming you are on a blank server with Git and docker installed:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/OpenSourceLAN/gameservers-docker.git .\n./build.sh factorio\n\n./start_server.sh factorio\n# Or\ndocker run -it --net=host -e \"SERVER_NAME=Some really cool server\"\\\n-v `pwd`/save:`cat factorio/mounts` --name factorio factorio\n\n```\n\nMost servers have environment variables that can be used to configure them.\nRead the README.md file in each directory to see what is available.\n\n## Tutorial\n\nThere is a [tutorial on the Open Source LAN website](http://opensourcelan.com/blog/2017/01/28/containing-your-game-servers/)\nwhich will step you through building and using the images.\n\n## Contributions \nContributions are welcome. Submit a pull request or open an issue. \n\nAll additions should follow these suggestions:\n* Set up for LAN by default - eg, call +sv_lan 1 in srcds games, but optionally disabling that by runtime var is fine\n* Include a start script that is added to the container, so anyone using the Dockerfile can easily customise their server\n\n\n## Advanced networking stuff\n\nWe want to expose all game servers directly to our LAN, and the `--host` option\nmeans we will get port conflicts. There is an alternative approach which uses\nthe ipvlan or macvlan docker network driver.\n\n```\n# Creates a docker network that's bridge with your layer 2 network\n# Subnet should match the IP range and subnet of your network.\n# ip-range is the CIDR block of IP addresses to assign to containers\n# parent is the name of the interface you'd like to bridge containers to\n\ndocker network create --driver ipvlan --subnet=10.0.0.0/24 -o parent=eth0 --ip-range 10.0.0.16/28 --gateway 10.0.0.1  gameservers\n\n# If the above command doesn't work, try using macvlan instead of ipvlan\n\n# Starts your game server inside the layer 2 network\ndocker run -it --rm --net=gameservers csgo /steam/csgo/srcds_run -game csgo +sv_lan 1 +map cs_office\n```\n\nYou can now see the CSGO server from another server on your network.\n\n\n## Running game servers on Docker Swarm\n\n[These are the instructions for building a swarm](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/install-manual/).\n\nIn addition to the swarm, one also needs a docker registry (I think). \n\nThese are the following gotchas that you need to be aware of:\n\n* If using ipvlan, you need _experimental_, not main release docker (as at version 1.12)\n* The ipvlan network is local scoped. This means you need to create the network on every\nhost individually. You should ensure the assigned IP ranges for each host do not overlap,\nas there does not appear to be any shared state about IP addresses assigned. The name of\nthe networks should be identical on every host.\n* The tutorial only has you set up a single consul instance. It will change IP addresses\nevery time the container restarts, and this will cause consul to fail because it cannot\nelect itself leader, since it thinks another instance exists at a different IP address.\nMake sure to hard code an IP for it.\n* Using ubuntu 14.04, you'll need to update `/etc/defaults/docker` to contain: `DOCKER_OPTS=\"-H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock\"`\n* If not using a secured docker registry, also add to the `DOCKER_OPTS` value: `--insecure-registry=registry-hostname:5000`\n* Consul, docker node and docker masters can all be on the same host (I think - it works for me at least)\n* To get a container to failover between hosts in the case of an outage, you need to run the container with these args: ` -e reschedule:on-node-failure`\n(todo: figure out why the container doesn't get auto-started on the new host).\nAlso note that a race condition exists - when the host comes back up, it will start the old container, and when \nthe docker swarm manager container starts, it will detect the container was moved and kill it.\n\n### Setting up multiple consul hosts\n\nRun the master like this:\n\n```\ndocker run -d  -v /mnt:/data --name consul \\\n    -p 8300:8300 \\\n    -p 8301:8301 \\\n    -p 8301:8301/udp \\\n    -p 8302:8302 \\\n    -p 8302:8302/udp \\\n    -p 8400:8400 \\\n    -p 8500:8500 \\\n    -p 53:53/udp \\\n    progrium/consul -server -advertise 10.0.0.167 -bootstrap-expect 3\n```\n\nand the other two like this:\n```\n    docker run -d -v /mnt:/data --name consul \\\n    -p 8300:8300 \\\n    -p 8301:8301 \\\n    -p 8301:8301/udp \\\n    -p 8302:8302 \\\n    -p 8302:8302/udp \\\n    -p 8400:8400 \\\n    -p 8500:8500 \\\n    -p 53:53/udp \\\n    progrium/consul -server -advertise 10.0.0.197 -join 10.0.0.167\n```\n\nDouble check all 3 are present in cluster by doing `curl http://localhost:8500/v1/status/peers`.\n\n\n### TODO\n\nEnsure every instance has:\n\n* A README covering available options, startup scripts, etc\n* Auto-mount point support where appropriate (eg, for saves, demos)\n* Config options for at least:\n  * The name of the server (what it shows as in server browsers)\n  * Server password\n  * RCON password (where RCON exists)\n  * LAN or internet\n* Has dockerfile configured with default ports it exposes (not that the suggested configuration uses these)\n* Has a way to easily RCON or remote control\n* Does not require user to manually download everything (with exceptions for some large and customisable downloads)\n* Fix the thing where the auto mounts always have permission problems because conatiners\n\nMake the easy start script support passing environment variables to the container\n\nMake an easy way to import config files in to the servers (eg mounting cfg directories)\n\nAdd more games\n\n### LICENSE\n\nThis project is licensed under GPL 3.0.

SSDs can be thought of as analogous to spatially and temporally extended Prisoner's Dilemma-like games. The reward structure poses a dilemma because individual short-term optimal strategies lead to poor long-term outcomes for the group.\n\nThe implemented environments are structured to be compatible with [OpenAIs gym environments](https://github.com/openai/gym) as well as [RLlib's Multiagent Environment](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/env/multi_agent_env.py)\n\n## Implemented Games\n\n* **Cleanup**: A public goods dilemma in which agents get a reward for consuming apples, but must use a cleaning beam to clean a river in order for apples to grow. While an agent is cleaning the river, other agents can exploit it by consuming the apples that appear.\n\n<img src=\"images/cleanup.png\" alt=\"Image of the cleanup game\" width=\"170\" height=\"246\"/>\n\n* **Harvest**: A tragedy-of-the-commons dilemma in which apples regrow at a rate that depends on the amount of nearby apples. If individual agents employ an exploitative strategy by greedily consuming too many apples, the collective reward of all agents is reduced.\n\n<img src=\"images/harvest.png\" alt=\"Image of the Harvest game\" width=\"483\" height=\"187\"/>\n\n<img src=\"images/schelling.png\" alt=\"Schelling diagrams for Harvest and Cleanup\" width=\"953\" height=\"352\"/>\n\nThe above plot shows the empirical Schelling diagrams for both Cleanup (A) and Harvest (B) (from [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08884)). These diagrams show the payoff that an individual agent can expect if it follows a defecting/exploitative strategy (red) vs a cooperative strategy (blue), given the number of other agents that are cooperating.  We can see that an individual agent can almost always greedily benefit from detecting, but the more agents that defect, the worse the outcomes for all agents.  \n\n# Setup instructions\nTo install the SSD environments:\n### Anaconda/miniconda\n```\ngit clone -b master https://github.com/eugenevinitsky/sequential_social_dilemma_games\ncd sequential_social_dilemma_games\nconda create -n ssd python==3.8.10 # Create a conda virtual environment\n# Patch ray due to https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/7946\n# And https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/8491\n. conda_uint8_patch.sh\n```\n###\n```\ngit clone -b master https://github.com/eugenevinitsky/sequential_social_dilemma_games\ncd sequential_social_dilemma_games\npython3 -m venv venv # Create a Python virtual environment\n. venv/bin/activate\npip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel\npython3 setup.py develop\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\n# Patch ray due to https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/7946\n# And https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/8491\n. venv_uint8_patch.sh\n```\n\nTo install sb3|rllib|all requirements for learning:\n```\npip install social-dilemmas[sb3|rllib|all]\n```\n\nIf using RLlib:\n```\n\n```\n\nAfter the setup, you can run experiments like so:\n- To train with default parameters (baseline model cleanup with 2 agents):\n`python3 run_scripts/train.py`\n\n- To train the MOA with 5 agents:\n`python3 run_scripts/train.py --model moa --num_agents 5`\n\nMany more options are available which can be found in [default_args.py](config/default_args.py). A collection of preconfigured training scripts can be found in [run_scripts](run_scripts). \n\nNote that the RLlib initialization time can be rather high (up to 5 minutes) the more agents you use, and the more complex your used model is.\n\n- To train using [Stable-Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) and parameter shared PPO:\n`python3 run_scripts/sb3_train.py --env harvest --num_agents 5`\n\n- To train using [MARL-Baselines3](https://github.com/Rohan138/marl-baselines3) and independent PPO:\n`python3 run_scripts/sb3_independent.py --env harvest --num_agents 5`\n\n- To train using [MARL-Baselines3](https://github.com/Rohan138/marl-baselines3) and independent PPO with inequity aversion:\n- \n`python3 run_scripts/sb3_independent.py --env harvest --num_agents 5 --inequity-averse-reward=True --alpha=5.0 --beta=0.05`\n\n# CUDA, cuDNN and tensorflow-gpu\n\nIf you run into any cuda errors, make sure you've got a [compatible set](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#tested_build_configurations) of cuda/cudnn/tensorflow versions installed. However, beware of the following:\n>The compatibility table given in the tensorflow site does not contain specific minor versions for cuda and cuDNN. However, if the specific versions are not met, there will be an error when you try to use tensorflow. [source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53727997)\n\n# Tests\nTests are located in the test folder and can be run individually or run by running `python -m pytest`. Many of the less obviously defined rules for the games can be understood by reading the tests, each of which outline some aspect of the game. \n\n# Constructing new environments\nEvery environment that subclasses MapEnv probably needs to implement the following methods\n\n```\n    def custom_reset(self):\n        \"\"\"Reset custom elements of the map. For example, spawn apples\"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def custom_action(self, agent, action):\n        \"\"\"Execute any custom, non-move actions that may be defined, like fire or clean\"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def custom_map_update(self):\n        \"\"\"Custom map updates that don't have to do with agent actions\"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def setup_agents(self):\n        \"\"\"Construct all the agents for the environment\"\"\"\n        raise NotImplementedError\n```\n\n## PPO Results\n\nThe below graphs display results for cleanup/harvest using un-tuned PPO in RLlib. As of yet, A3C remains untested.\n\n**Collective cleanup reward**:\n\n<img src=\"images/cleanup_collective_reward.svg\" alt=\"Collective reward plot of cleanup\" width=\"460.8\" height=\"345.6\"/>\n\n**Collective harvest reward**:\n\n<img src=\"images/harvest_collective_reward.svg\" alt=\"Collective reward plot of harvest\" width=\"460.8\" height=\"345.6\"/>\n\n\n## Relevant papers\n\n1.

  "readme_contents": "ReShade\n=======\n\nThis is a generic post-processing injector for games and video software. It exposes an automated way to access both frame color and depth information and a custom shader language called ReShade FX to write effects like ambient occlusion, depth of field, color correction and more which work everywhere.\n\nReShade can optionally load **add-ons**, DLLs that make use of the ReShade API to extend functionality of both ReShade and/or the application ReShade is being applied to. To get started on how to write your own add-on, check out the [API reference](REFERENCE.md).\n\nThe ReShade FX shader compiler contained in this repository is standalone, so can be integrated into other projects as well. Simply add all `source/effect_*.*` files to your project and use it similar to the [fxc example](tools/fxc.cpp).\n\n## Building\n\nYou'll need Visual Studio 2017 or higher to build ReShade and Python for the `gl3w` dependency.\n\n1. Clone this repository including all Git submodules\n2. Open the Visual Studio solution\n3. Select either the `32-bit` or `64-bit` target platform and build the solution.\\\n   This will build ReShade and all dependencies. To build the setup tool, first build the `Release` configuration for both `32-bit` and `64-bit` targets and only afterwards build the `Release Setup` configuration (does not matter which target is selected then).\n\nA quick overview of what some of the source code files contain:\n\n|File                                                                  |Description                                                            |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|[dll_log.cpp](source/dll_log.cpp)                                     |Simple file logger implementation                                      |\n|[dll_main.cpp](source/dll_main.cpp)                                   |Main entry point (and optional test application)                       |\n|[dll_resources.cpp](source/dll_resources.cpp)                         |Access to DLL resource data (e.g. built-in shaders)                    |\n|[effect_lexer.cpp](source/effect_lexer.cpp)                           |Lexical analyzer for C-like languages                                  |\n|[effect_parser.cpp](source/effect_parser.cpp)                         |Parser for the ReShade FX shader language                              |\n|[effect_preprocessor.cpp](source/effect_preprocessor.cpp)             |C-like preprocessor implementation                                     |\n|[hook.cpp](source/hook.cpp)                                           |Wrapper around MinHook which tracks associated function pointers       |\n|[hook_manager.cpp](source/hook_manager.cpp)                           |Automatic hook installation based on DLL exports                       |\n|[input.cpp](source/input.cpp)                                         |Keyboard and mouse input management and window message queue hooks     |\n|[runtime.cpp](source/runtime.cpp)                                     |Core ReShade runtime including effect and preset management            |\n|[runtime_gui.cpp](source/runtime_gui.cpp)                             |Overlay rendering and everything user interface related                |\n\n## Contributing\n\nAny contributions to the project are welcomed, it's recommended to use GitHub [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).\n\n## Feedback and Support\n\nSee the [ReShade Forum](https://reshade.me/forum) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/PrwndfH) server for feedback and support.\n\n## License\n\nReShade is licensed under the terms of the [BSD 3-clause license](LICENSE.md).\\\nSome source code files are dual-licensed and are also available under the terms of the MIT license, when stated as such at the top of those files.\n"

You'll learn how to create python games with AI. I try to focus on creating board games without GUI in Jupyter-notebook.\n\n---\n\n## Table of contents \ud83d\udccb\n\n| **No.** | **Name** | \n| ------- | -------- | \n| 01 | **[Bulls and Cows with AI](https://github.com/milaan9/92_Python_Games/tree/main/001_Bulls_and_Cows_with_AI)** |\n| 02 | **[Tic-Tac-Toe with AI](https://github.com/milaan9/92_Python_Games/tree/main/002_Tic_Tac_Toe_with_AI)** |\n\n\nThese are online **read-only** versions. However you can **`Run \u25b6`**  all the codes **online** by clicking here \u279e <a href=\"https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/milaan9/92_Python_Games/HEAD\"><img src=\"https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg\" alt=\"binder\"/></a>\n\n---\n\n## Frequently asked questions \u2754\n\n### How can I thank you for writing and sharing this tutorial? \ud83c\udf37\n\nYou can <img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=%E2%AD%90 Star &message=if%20useful&style=style=flat&color=blue\" alt=\"Star Badge\"/> and <img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=%E2%B5%96 Fork &message=if%20useful&style=style=flat&color=blue\" alt=\"Fork Badge\"/> Starring and Forking is free for you, but it tells me and other people that it was helpful and you like this tutorial.\n\nGo [**`here`**](https://github.com/milaan9/92_Python_Games) if you aren't here already and click \u279e **`\u2730 Star`** and **`\u2d56 Fork`** button in the top right corner. You will be asked to create a GitHub account if you don't already have one.\n\n---\n\n### How can I read this tutorial without an Internet connection? <img alt=\"GIF\" src=\"https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/hmm.gif\" width=\"20\" />\n\n1. Go [**`here`**](https://github.com/milaan9/92_Python_Games) and click the big green \u279e **`Code`** button in the top right of the page, then click \u279e [**`Download ZIP`**](https://github.com/milaan9/92_Python_Games/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).\n\n    ![Download ZIP](img/dnld_rep.png) \n\n2. Extract the ZIP and open it. Unfortunately I don't have any more specific instructions because how exactly this is done depends on which operating system you run.\n    \n3. Launch ipython notebook from the folder which contains the notebooks. Open each one of them\n  \n    **`Kernel > Restart & Clear Output`**\n    \nThis will clear all the outputs and now you can understand each statement and learn interactively.\n\nIf you have git and you know how to use it, you can also clone the repository instead of downloading a zip and extracting it.

The `Stage` component does the same with game scale.\n\n### World\n\nIf you intend on using physics in your game, a good next component would be the `World` component, which creates and provides a physics engine & world:\n\n```js\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <Loop>\n      <Stage>\n        <World>\n          // Game specific components go here\n        </World>\n      </Stage>\n    </Loop>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Physics Bodies\n\nOnce you have a physics engine/world established, you can use the `Body` component to define physics bodies inline:\n\n```js\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <Loop>\n      <Stage>\n        <World>\n          <Body args={[0,0,75,75]} ref={ (b) => this.body = b.body }>\n            // Sprites go here\n          </Body>\n        </World>\n      </Stage>\n    </Loop>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nUsing a ref you can obtain a reference to the physics body and modify its properties via the [Matter-js API](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js).\n\n### Next Steps\n\nOnce this general structure is established, what follows usually depends on what kind of game you intend to make. Check out the API documentation below for further clarity regarding use of these components.\n\n## React Native\n\nUsing this library with React Native is a simple as importing from the native directory:\n\n```js\nimport { Loop, Stage, ...etc } from 'react-game-kit/native';\n```\n\n> Note: AudioPlayer and KeyListener are not implemented on the React Native version.\n\n## API\n\n#### \\<Loop />\n\nThe `Loop` component acts much like a Redux provider, in that it passes a GameLoop instance down the component tree via `this.context.loop`.\n\nThis allows you to subscribe and unsubscribe to the main game loop anywhere in your component tree. Here is an example of how this would generally look:\n\n```js\nclass ChildComponent extends React.Component {\n  static contextTypes = {\n    loop: PropTypes.object,\n  };\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.context.loop.subscribe(this.update);\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    this.context.loop.unsubscribe(this.update);\n  }\n\n  update() {\n    // tick logic\n  };\n}\n\n```\n\n--\n\n#### \\<Stage />\n\n**height** (_number_) : Base game height. Defaults to `576`.\n\n**width** (_number_) : Base game width. Defaults to `1024`.\n\nThe `Stage` component also leverages `context` much like `Loop`, except it passes game scale as `this.context.scale`. You can use this value to appropriately scale positioning and dimension values within your game. Again, you would have to specify `scale: PropTypes.number` in your component's `contextTypes` to receive this value.\n\n--\n\n#### \\<World />\n\n**gravity** (_object_) : World gravity object.\n\nDefaults:\n\n```js\ngravity={{\n  x: 0,\n  y: 1,\n  scale: 0.001,\n}}\n```\n\n**onCollision** (_func_) : World collision callback.\n\n**onInit** (_func_) : World init callback.\n\n**onUpdate** (_func_) : World update callback.\n\nThe `World` component is used as the first step in setting up game physics. It passes a `matter-js` Engine instance down via context as `this.context.engine`. Generally speaking, when getting or settings physics properties you'll want to do this after the physics world is updated in the main tick cycle. You can hook into this using the `onUpdate` prop, or in child components use `Matter.Events.on(this.context.engine, 'afterUpdate', this.update);` to subscribe to the engine updates.\n\nThe `onInit` callback is a great place to do your initial world setup, things like creating static bodies for walls and the floor.\n\n--\n\n#### \\<Body />\n\n**args** (_array_) : Initial body creation arguments. Depends on the `shape` prop, which maps to Matter.Bodies body creation methods detailed here: [Matter.Bodies Documentation](http://brm.io/matter-js/docs/classes/Bodies.html)\n\nAll other props on the body component map directly to [Matter-js Body properties](http://brm.io/matter-js/docs/classes/Body.html).\n\nThe `Body` component is used to define physics bodies. You will generally want to use `ref` to obtain a reference to the body, at which point you can call Matter-js methods on it, as well as listen to and react to its physic properties in the world update callback.\n\n--\n\n#### \\<Sprite />\n\n\n**offset** (array) : Sprite sheet x,y offset.\n\n**onPlayStateChanged** (func) : Sprite play state changed callback.\n\n**repeat** (bool) : Determines whether sprite animation should loop.\n\n**scale** (number) : Scale value for sprite image.\n\n**src** (string) : src path for sprite sheet.\n\n**state** (number) : Vertical position in sprite sheet.\n\n**steps** (array) : Number of animation steps for current row (state).\n\n**ticksPerFrame** (number) : Number of loop ticks per animation frame.\n\n**tileHeight** (number) : Height of spritesheet tile.\n\n**tileWidth** (number) : Width of spritesheet tile.\n\nThe `Sprite` component lets you define sprite animations using sprite sheets. When creating a sprite sheet, define sprite tile dimensions that will be provided via the `tileHeight` & `tileWidth` props. Next, each animation state is represented by a row, with steps of the animation represented as columns.\n\n--\n\n#### \\<TileMap />\n\n**columns** (number) : number of columns in tile map.\n\n**layers** (array) : Array of arrays that contain tile indexes.\n\n**renderTile** (func) : Overrideable tile rendering function.\n\n**rows** (number) : Number of rows in tile map.\n\n**scale** (number) : Tile map scale.\n\n**src** (string) : Tilemap image src path.\n\n**tileSize** (number) : Tilemap tile size.\n\n**width** (number) : Tilemap width.\n\n**height** (number) : Tilemap height.\n\nThe `TileMap` component lets you define tile maps from a tile atlas. Your tilemap is made of up rows and columns. Each layer is then drawn using those numbers as reference. So for example, if you had 4 rows and 4 columns, with 1 layer, your `layers` prop would look like:\n\n```js\nlayers={[\n  [\n    0, 0, 0, 0,\n    1, 0, 1, 1,\n    0, 0, 1, 0,\n    1, 0, 0, 0,\n  ]\n]}\n```\n\n--\n\n\n\n## License\n\n[MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\n## Maintenance Status\n\n**Archived:** This project is no longer maintained by Formidable.

  "readme_contents": "Source-1-Games\n==============\n\nThis is the README for the Source 1 based games.  Source 1 based games include Team Fortress 2, Left4Dead2, and Counter-Strike: Source.\n\nPlease use this repository to report bugs and feature requests for Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Source, Left4Dead2, and the Source 1 Engine.\n\nConduct\n-------\n\nThere are basic rules of conduct that should be followed at all times by everyone participating in the discussions.  While this is generally a relaxed environment, please remember the following:\n\n- Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.\n- Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.\n- Do not use ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.\n- Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists.\n\nRemember: Just because the issue you reported was reported here does not mean that it is an issue with Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Source or any other Source 1 game.  As well, should your issue not be resolved immediately, it does not mean that a resolution is not being researched or tested.  Patience is always appreciated.\n\nReporting Issues\n----------------\n\nIf you encounter a bug while using Source 1 games, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues) to see if it has already been reported. Include closed issues in your search.\n\nIf it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:\n\n- which game you're reporting the bug on (TF2, CS:S, all)\n- a short, descriptive title;\n- a detailed description of the issue, including any output from the command line;\n- steps for reproducing the issue; and\n- your [system information](#system-information).\n\nPlease place logs either in a code block ([go here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for a GFM cheat sheet) or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).\n\n### System information\n\nYour system information must include:\n- your Linux distro or OS version\n- your Desktop/Window Manager (Linux only)\n- your Graphics card info (manufacturer, card version), any and all graphics driver versions\n- anything else that you think may be useful (mouse/keyboard, filesystem type, etc).\n\nThe preferred and easiest way to get this information is from Steam's Hardware Information viewer from the menu (`Help -> System Information`).\n\nOnce your information appears: right-click within the dialog, choose `Select All`, right-click again, and then choose `Copy`.\nPaste this information into your report, preferably in a code block or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).\n\nFeature Requests\n-------------------\n\nIf you are asking for a new feature or enhancement for a game, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues) to see if it has already been asked for. Include closed issues in your search.\n\nIf it has been asked for, go ahead and put your 2 cents in for it in the existing entry.\n\nIf it has not been asked for, create a new issue with at least the following information:\n\n - The game your asking for the enhancement\n - A clear description of what exactly you want\n - Justification as to why this is something that is needed\n - Why we should do this feature rather than doing some other feature on the list\n\nRemember that just because you ask for a feature improvement doesn't mean we'll get to it.  We're mostly going to be focused on existing bugs rather than enhancing these games.  That being said, it does make a difference to know what you want here.  Be clear.  Be concise.\n\nDriver Contact Information\n--------------------------\n\nSome of the issue you may be experiencing are due to the various video drivers.  Here is an incomplete list of places that you might be able to file bugs or get additional help:\n\n### AMD\n\nAMD Steam Linux forum for reporting **compatibility and performance issues with AMD hardware**:\n\nhttps://community.amd.com/community/devgurus/steam-linux\n\nThe AMD Open Source driver is a part of Mesa, so use the links under \"Intel\" to report issues with it.\n\n### Intel\n\nFor discussions, there is the mesa-users email list:\n\nhttp://mesa3d.org/lists.html\n\nBugs and feature requests should be logged in bugzilla:\n\nhttp://mesa3d.org/bugs.html\n\n### NVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA supported drivers\n- https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/board/98\n\nOpen Source NVIDIA driver (nouveau)\n- http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/\n\nIf you know of any other places, please let us know.\n\nKnown Video Driver/Card issues:\n----------------------------------\n\n### NVIDIA\n\n6xxx and 7xxx hardware have been EOL'd. The code specific to these GPUs isn't even compiled into drivers anymore.\n\n6xxx and 7xxx GPUs are incapable of performing sRGB functionality needed by Source Engine titles when being driven by OpenGL. (The sRGB behavior as specified in OpenGL is slightly different than the behavior that was actually unspecified in D3D9, which is why this works in D3D9 but not in OpenGL).\n\n"

This demo app is my first adventure in Flutter and I have to say its been a blast!\n\n[![Screenshots](screenshots/demo.gif)](https://gallery.codelessly.com/flutterwebsites/fluttergames/?utm_medium=image&utm_campaign=preview)\n\n# Screenshots\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/searchy2/FlutterGames/master/screenshots/main_1_540x900.jpg\" width=\"360\"/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/searchy2/FlutterGames/master/screenshots/details_1_540x900.jpg\" width=\"360\"/>\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/searchy2/FlutterGames/master/screenshots/details_2_540x900.jpg\" width=\"360\"/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/searchy2/FlutterGames/master/screenshots/coming_soon_540x900.jpg\" width=\"360\"/>\n\n# Flutter is Amazing\n\nA quick list of what I found makes Flutter great:\n\n* **Views are code.** Much less boilerplate than having adapters, viewholders, and XML all over the place.\n* **Hero shared element transitions.** Just wrap shared elements in a Hero widget and give them the same tag to created a shared transition. No need to read 3 pages of documentation and write tightly coupled code :) This is truly mindblowing. \n* **Graceful image loading.** Flutter understands that visible images should be loaded first. The way Flutter does image loading in a List is just so beautiful!\n* **Highly customizable button content positioning.** On Android, Buttons aren't very well designed. 'drawableLeft' and 'drawableRight' have very awkward and difficult to customize positioning. Flutter gives you full control over the positioning of items in your button.\n* **Minimal dependencies.** Flutter comes with so much out of the box. This entire app was built without any external dependencies! (cupertino icons doesn't count :P)\n\n# Flutter Wishlist\n\nFlutter is very new so there are some features and libraries missing that would make development much better. Here are some of those missing components I would have liked to use:\n\n---\n\n>Image Gallery \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSomething to view images with. Android doesn't have a good image viewing library either (sigh).\n\n**UPDATE:** https://github.com/tinylife-io/flutter_scroll_gallery\n\n>Change Button's Inner Contents on Press\n\nThere's no way to set text/icon color when a button is pressed. This lack of functionality really limits the range of buttons one can create.\n\n>Video Player \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSomething to play trailer videos or just videos in general.\n\n**UPDATE:** https://github.com/brianegan/chewie\n\n---\n\nIf any of the above now exists, please let me know.\n\nPull requests are most welcome!\n\nIf you've fixed a bug or have a feature you've added, just create a pull request.

Some of the results: 15 min Mujoco humanoid training, 2 min atari pong.\n* Added Brax and Mujoco colab training examples.\n* Added 'seed' command line parameter. Will override seed in config in case it's > 0.\n* Deprecated `horovod` in favor of `torch.distributed` ([#171](https://github.com/Denys88/rl_games/pull/171)).\n\n1.4.0\n\n* Added discord channel https://discord.gg/hnYRq7DsQh :)\n* Added envpool support with a few atari examples. Works 3-4x time faster than ray.\n* Added mujoco results. Much better than openai spinning up ppo results.\n* Added tcnn(https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn) support. Reduces 5-10% of training time in the IsaacGym envs. \n* Various fixes and improvements.\n\n1.3.2\n\n* Added 'sigma' command line parameter. Will override sigma for continuous space in case if fixed_sigma is True.\n\n1.3.1\n\n* Fixed SAC not working\n\n1.3.0\n\n* Simplified rnn implementation. Works a little bit slower but much more stable. \n* Now central value can be non-rnn if policy is rnn.\n* Removed load_checkpoint from the yaml file. now --checkpoint works for both train and play.\n\n1.2.0\n\n* Added Swish (SILU) and GELU activations, it can improve Isaac Gym results for some of the envs.\n* Removed tensorflow and made initial cleanup of the old/unused code.\n* Simplified runner.\n* Now networks are created in the algos with load_network method.\n\n1.1.4\n\n* Fixed crash in a play (test) mode in player, when simulation and rl_devices are not the same.\n* Fixed variuos multi gpu errors.\n\n1.1.3\n\n* Fixed crash when running single Isaac Gym environment in a play (test) mode.\n* Added config parameter ```clip_actions``` for switching off internal action clipping and rescaling\n\n1.1.0\n\n* Added to pypi: ```pip install rl-games```\n* Added reporting env (sim) step fps, without policy inference. Improved naming.\n* Renames in yaml config for better readability: steps_num to horizon_length amd lr_threshold to kl_threshold\n\n\n\n## Troubleshouting\n\n* Some of the supported envs are not installed with setup.py, you need to manually install them\n* Starting from rl-games 1.1.0 old yaml configs won't be compatible with the new version: \n    * ```steps_num``` should be changed to ```horizon_length``` amd ```lr_threshold``` to ```kl_threshold```\n\n## Known issues\n\n* Running a single environment with Isaac Gym can cause crash, if it happens switch to at least 2 environments simulated in parallel\n    \n\n"

Enables extra logging output, debug symbols, and much more verbose compiler warnings (default `Release`).\n- `-DWARNING_AS_ERROR=0` Whether to treat compilation warnings as errors in debug mode (default 1 = yes).\n- `-DUPDATE_TRANSLATIONS=1` Configure `make` to update the translation .ts files for new strings in the source code. Note: Running `make clean` will remove the .ts files (default 0 = no).\n- `-DTEST=1` Enable regression tests (default 0 = no). Note: needs googletest, will be downloaded on the fly if unavailable. To run tests: ```make test```.\n- `-DFORCE_USE_QT5=1` Skip looking for Qt6 before trying to find Qt5\n\n\n# Run\n\n`Cockatrice` is the game client<br>\n`Oracle` fetches card data<br>\n`Servatrice` is the server<br>\n\n**Servatrice Docker container**\n\nYou can run an instance of Servatrice (the Cockatrice server) using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker) and the Cockatrice Dockerfile.<br>\n\nFirst, create an image from the Dockerfile<br>\n`cd /path/to/Cockatrice-Repo/`\n`docker build -t servatrice .`<br>\nAnd then run it<br>\n`docker run -i -p 4747:4747/tcp -t servatrice:latest`<br>\n\n>Note: Running this command exposes the TCP port 4747 of the docker container<br>\nto permit connections to the server.\n\nFind more information on how to use Servatrice with Docker in our [wiki](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/wiki/Setting-up-Servatrice#using-docker).\n\n**Docker compose**\n\nThere is also a docker-compose file available which will configure and run both a MySQL server and Servatrice. The docker-compose setup scripts can be found in the `servatrice/docker` folder and vary only slightly from the default sql and server .ini files. The setup scripts can either be modified in place, or docker-compose can mount alternative files into the images, as you prefer.\n\nTo run Servatrice via docker-compose, first install docker-compose following the [install instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Once installed, run the following from the root of the repository:\n```bash\ndocker-compose build    # Build the Servatrice image using the same Dockerfile as above.\ndocker-compose up       # Setup and run both the MySQL server and Servatrice.\n```\n\n>Note: Similar to the above Docker setup, this will expose TCP ports 4747 and 4748.\n\n>Note: The first time running the docker-compose setup, the MySQL server will take a little time to run the initial setup scripts. Due to this, the Servatrice instance may fail the first few attempts to connect to the database. Servatrice is set to `restart: always` in the docker-compose.yml, which will allow it to continue attempting to start up. Once the MySQL scripts have completed, Servatrice should then connect automatically on the next attempt.\n\n**Docker compose in Windows**\nA out of box working docker-compose file has been added to help setup in Windows.\n\nDocker in Windows requires additional steps in form of using Docker Desktop to allow resource sharing from the drive the volumes are mapped from, as well as potential workarounds needed to get file sharing working in Windows. This [StackOverflow discussion sheds some light on it](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42203488/settings-to-windows-firewall-to-allow-docker-for-windows-to-share-drive)\n\n\n# License [![GPLv2 License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Cockatrice/Cockatrice.svg)](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/blob/master/LICENSE)\n\nCockatrice is free software, licensed under the [GPLv2](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/blob/master/LICENSE).\n"

  "readme_contents": "![Hexi](/tutorials/screenshots/logoAndIllustration.png)\n\nHexi\n====\n\n**Hexi** is a fun and easy way to make HTML5 games or any other\nkind interactive media using pure JavaScript code. Take a look at \nthe feature list and the [examples](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/tree/master/examples) folder to get started. Keep scrolling, \nand you'll find a complete Quick Start Guide and beginner's tutorials ahead. If you've never made a game before, the tutorials are the best place to start.\n\nWhat's great about Hexi? You get all the power of WebGL rendering with\na streamlined API that lets you write your code in a\n[minimalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku),\n[declarative](http://latentflip.com/imperative-vs-declarative/) way.\nIt makes coding a game as easy and fun as writing poetry or drawing. Try it! If you\nneed any help or have any questions, post something in this\nrepository's [Issues](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/issues).\nThe Issues page is is Hexi's friendly chat room - don't be afraid to\nask for help :) \n\nYou only need one file from this repository to get started using Hexi:\n[`hexi.min.js`](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/blob/master/bin/hexi.min.js). That's all! [Link it to your HTML document with a `<script>` tag](http://www.quackit.com/javascript/tutorial/external_javascript_file.cfm), and go for it! \nHexi has been written, from the ground up, in the latest version of\nJavaScript (ES6/7, 20015/6) but is compiled down to ES5 (using [Babel](https://babeljs.io)) so that it will run anywhere. What do you need to know before you start using Hexi? You should have a reasonable understanding of HTML and JavaScript. You don't have to be an expert, just an ambitious beginner with an eagerness to learn. If you don't know HTML and JavaScript, the best place to start learning it is this book:\n\n[Foundation Game Design with HTML5 and JavaScript](http://www.apress.com/9781430247166)\n\nI know for a fact that it's the best book, because I wrote it!\n\nOk, got it? Do you know what JavaScript variables, functions, arrays and objects are and how to use them? Do you know what [JSON data files](http://www.copterlabs.com/blog/json-what-it-is-how-it-works-how-to-use-it/) are? Have you used the [Canvas Drawing API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Drawing_graphics_with_canvas)? Then you're ready to start using Hexi!  \n\nOf course, Hexi is completely free to use: for-anything, for-ever! It was written in Canada (Toronto, Hamilton), India (Kullu Valley, Ladakh), Nepal (Kathmandu, Pokhara, Annapurna Base Camp), Thailand (Ko Phangan, Ko Tao) and South Africa (Cape Town), and is the result of 15 years' research into API usability for game design. The name, \"Hexi\" comes from [\"Hex\"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hex) + [\"Pixi\"](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/) = \"Hexi\".

[A Guide to the examples](#aguidetotheexamples)\n\n<a id='features'></a>\nFeatures\n--------\n\nHere's Hexi's core feature list:\n\n- All the most important sprites you need: rectangles, circles, lines,\n  text, image sprites and animated \"MovieClip\" style sprites. You can make any of these sprites with one only line of code. You can also create your own custom sprite types.\n- A complete scene graph with nested child-parent hierarchies (including\n  a `stage`, and `addChild`/`removeChild` methods), local and global\n  coordinates, depth layers, and rotation pivots.\n- `group` sprites together to make game scenes. \n- A game loop with a user-definable `fps` and fully customizable and\n  drop-dead-simple game state manager. `pause` and `resume` the game\n  loop at any time.\n- Tileset (spritesheet) support using `frame` and `filmstrip` methods to make\n  sprites using tileset frames.\n- Built-in texture atlas support for the popular Texture Packer\n  format. \n- A keyframe animation and state manager for sprites. Use `show` to\n  display a sprite's image state. Use `playAnimation` to play\n  a sequence of frames (in a `loop` if you want to). Use\n  `show` to display a specific frame number. Use `fps` to set the\n  frame rate for sprite animations which is independent from the game's\n  frame rate.\n- Interactive `button` sprites with `up`, `over` and `down` states.\n- Any sprite can be set to `interact` to receive mouse and touch\n  actions.\n  Intuitive `press`, `release`, `over`, `out` and `tap` methods for buttons and interactive\n  sprites.\n- Easy-to-use keyboard key bindings. Easily define your own with the `keyboard`\n  method.\n- A built-in universal `pointer` that works with both the mouse and\n  touch. Assign your own custom `press`, `release` and `tap` methods\n  or use any of the pointer's built-in properties: `isUp`, `isDown`,\n  `tapped`, `x` and `y`. Define as many pointers as you need for multi-touch. (It also works with isometric maps!)\n- Conveniently position sprites relative to other sprites using\n  `putTop`, `putRight`, `putBottom`, `putLeft` and `putCenter`. Align\n  sprites horizontally or vertically using `flowRight`, `flowLeft`,\n  `flowUp` or `flowDown`.\n- A universal asset loader to pre-load images, fonts, sounds and JSON\n  data files. All popular file formats are supported. You can load new assets into the game at any time.\n- An optional `load` state that lets you run actions while assets are\n  loading. You can use the `load` state to add a loading progress bar.\n- A fast and focused [Pixi-based](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/) rendering engine. If Pixi can do it, so can Hexi! Hexi \n  is just a thin layer of code that sits on top of Pixi. And you can access the\n  global `PIXI` object at any time to write pure Pixi code directly if you want\n  to. Hexi includes the latest stable version of Pixi v3.0 automatically bundled for you.\n- A sophisticated game loop using a fixed timestep with variable rendering\n  and sprite interpolation.

Includes a full suite of isometric map utilities.\n- [Sound.js](https://github.com/kittykatattack/sound.js): A micro-library for loading, controlling and generating\n  sound and music effects. Everything you need to add sound to games.\n- [Smoothie](https://github.com/kittykatattack/smoothie): Ultra-smooth sprite animation using \n  true delta-time interpolation. It also lets you specify the fps (frames-per-second) at which \n  your game or application runs, and completely separates your sprite rendering loop from your\n  application logic loop.\n\nRead the documents at the code repositories for each of these modules to find out\nwhat you can do with them and exactly how they work. Because they're\nall built into Hexi, you don't have to install them yourself - they\njust work right out-of-the-box.\n\nHexi lets you access most of these module methods and properties as\n**top-level objects**. For example, if you want to access the `hit` method\nfrom the Bump collision module, you can do it like this:\n```js\ng.hit(spriteOne, spriteTwo);\n```\nBut you can also access the Bump module directly if you need to, like this:\n```js\ng.bump.hit(spriteOne, spriteTwo);\n```\n(This assumes that your Hexi instance is called `g`);\n\nJust refer to the module name using **lowerCamelCase**. That means you can\naccess the Smoothie module as `smoothie` and the Sprite Utilities\nmodule as `spriteUtilities`.\n\nThere are two exceptions to this convention. You can access the Pixi\nglobal object directly as `PIXI`. Also, the functions in the Sound.js module\nare also only accessible as top-level global objects. This is was done\nto simplify the way these modules are integrated with Hexi, and\nmaintain the widest possible cross-platform compatibility.\n\nIf you're a developer and would like to contribute to Hexi, the best\nway is to contribute new and improved features to these modules. Or,\nif you're really ambitious, propose a new module to the Hexi\ndevelopment team (in this repo's [Issues](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/issues),\nand maybe we'll add it to Hexi's core!)\n\n<a id='quickstart'></a>\nHexi quick start\n----------------\n\nTo start working with Hexi quickly, take a look at the Quick Start\nproject in Hexi's [examples\nfolder](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/tree/master/examples).\nYou'll find the [HTML container page here](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/blob/master/examples/01_quickStart.html) and the [JavaScript\nsource file here](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/blob/master/examples/src/quickStart.js). The source code is fully commented and explains how all everything works so, if you want to, you can just skip straight to that file and read through it. (You'll find the complied, ES5, version of the JavaScript file [in the `bin` folder](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/tree/master/examples/bin).) \n\nThe Quick Start project is a tour of all of Hexi's main features, and you can use it as a template for making your own new Hexi applications. Click on the image below to try a working example:\n\n[![Quick start](/tutorials/screenshots/30.png)](https://cdn.gitcdn.xyz/cdn/kittykatattack/hexi/a1713aa19bdcc9a0c661e67d079a205d7c221917/examples/01_quickStart.html)\n\nYou'll first see a loading bar that shows you the percentage of files\n(sounds and images) being loaded. You'll then see a spinning message that asks to you to tap on the screen to create cats. Cats will appear on the screen wherever you click with the pointer while music plays in\nthe background. (Oops, Sorry! I forgot to warn you about the music!) A text field rotates and counts the number of cats\nyou've created. The cats themselves move and bounce around the\nscreen, while scaling in size and oscillating their transparency.\nHere's an illustration of what you'll see:\n\n![Quick start illustration](/tutorials/screenshots/31.png)\n\nWhy cats? [Because](http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/toxo-terror-are-our-brains-controlled-by-cat-loving-parasites).\n\nIf you know how this Quick Start application was made, you'll be well on your\nway to being productive with Hexi fast - so let's find out!\n\n(Note: If you're new to game programming and feel you need a gentler,\nmore methodical, introduction to Hexi, check out the [Tutorials](#tutorials) section ahead. You'll learn how to make 3 complete games from scratch, and each game gradually builds on the skills you learnt in the previous game.)\n\n<a id='thehtmlcontainer'></a>\n### The HTML container\n\nThe only file you need to start using Hexi is\n[`hexi.min.js`](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/blob/master/bin/hexi.min.js). It has an incredibly simple \"installation\": Just link it to an HTML page with a `<script>` tag. Then link your main JavaScript file that will contain your game or application code. Here's what a typical Hexi HTML container page might look like:\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<title>Hexi</title>\n<body>\n<script src=\"hexi.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"main.js\"></script>\n</body>\n```\nYou can, of course, load as many external script files that you need\nfor your game.\n\nIf you need a little more fine-control, you can alternatively load\nHexi using three separate files: The Pixi renderer, Hexi's modules, and Hexi's `core.js`file. \n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<title>Hexi</title>\n<body>\n\n<!-- Pixi renderer, Hexi's modules, and Hexi's core  -->\n<script src=\"pixi.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"modules.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"core.js\"></script>\n\n<!-- Main application file -->\n<script src=\"bin/quickStart.js\"></script>\n</body>\n```\nAn advantage to doing this is that it lets you swap out Hexi's\ninternal version of Pixi, with your own custom build of Pixi, or a\nspecific version of Pixi that you want to use. Or maybe you made some\nother crazy modifications to Hexi's modules that you want to try out. But typically, you'll probably never need to do this.\n\n<a id='hexisarchitecture'></a>\n### Hexi's Architecture\n\nAll the fun happens in your main JavaScript file. Hexi\napplications have a very simple but flexible architecture that you can\nscale to any size you need. Small games with a few hundred lines of code or big games with a few hundred files - Hexi can do it!\nHere's the structure of at typical Hexi application:\n\n1. Start Hexi.\n2. The `load` function, that will run while your files are loading.\n3. The `setup` function, which initializes your game objects, variables and sprites.\n4. The `play` function, which is your game or application logic that runs in a loop.\n\nAnd Here's what this actually looks like in real code:\n\n```js\n//1. Setting up and starting Hexi\n\n//An array of files you want to load\nlet thingsToLoad = [\"anyFiles\", \"youWant\", \"toLoad\"];\n\n//Initialize and start Hexi\nlet g = hexi(canvasWidth, canvasHeight, setup, thingsToLoad, load);\ng.start();\n\n//2. The `load` function that will run while your files are loading\n\nfunction load(){\n  \n  //Display an optional loading bar\n  g.loadingBar();\n}\n\n//3. The `setup` function, which initializes your game objects, variables and sprites\n\nfunction setup() {\n\n  //Create your game objects here\n\n  //Set the game state to `play` to start the game loop\n  g.state = play;\n}\n\n//4. The `play` function, which is your game or application logic that runs in a loop\n\nfunction play(){\n  //This is your game loop, where you can move sprites and add your\n  //game logic\n}\n```\nThis simple model is all you need to create any kind of game or application.\nYou can use it as the starting template for your own projects, and this same\nbasic model can scale to any size.\n\nLet's find out how this architectural model was used to build the Quick\nStart application.\n\n<a id='settingupandstartinghexi'></a>\n### 1. Setting up and starting Hexi\n\nFirst, create an array that lists all the files you want to load. The Quick\nStart project loads an image file, a font file, and a music file.\n```js\nlet thingsToLoad = [\n  \"images/cat.png\",\n  \"fonts/puzzler.otf\",\n  \"sounds/music.wav\"\n];\n```\nIf you don't have any files you want to load, just skip this step.\n\nNext, initialize Hexi with the `hexi` function. Here's how to initialize a\nnew Hexi application with a screen size of 512x512 pixels. It tells\nHexi to load the files in the `thingsToLoad` array, run a function called `load` while\nits loading, and then run a function called `setup` when everything is ready to go.\n```js\nlet g = hexi(512, 512, setup, thingsToLoad, load);\n```\nYou can now access the instance of Hexi in your application through an\nobject called `g` (Although, you can give this any name you like. I\nlike using \"g\" because it stands for \"game\", and is short to type.)\n\nThe `hexi` function has 5 arguments, although only the first 3 are required.\n\n1. Canvas width.\n2. Canvas height. \n3. The `setup` function.\n4. The `thingsToLoad` array you defined above. This is optional.\n5. The `load` function. This is also optional.\n\nIf you skip the last two arguments, Hexi will skip the loading process and jump straight to the `setup` function.\n\nOptionally Set the frames per second at which the game logic loop should run.\n(Sprites will be rendered independently, with interpolation, at full 60 fps)\nIf you don't set the `fps`, Hexi will default to an fps of 60.\n```js\ng.fps = 30;\n```\nSetting an fps lower than 60 gives you much more performance overhead to play\nwith, and your games will still look great.\n\nYou can also optionally add a border and set the background color.\n```js\ng.border = \"2px red dashed\";\ng.backgroundColor = 0x000000;\n```\nAnd, if you want to scale and align the game screen to the maximum browser\nwindow size, you can use the `scaleToWindow` method.\n```js\ng.scaleToWindow();\n```\nFinally, call the `start` method to get Hexi running\n```js\ng.start();\n```\nThis is important! Without calling the `start` method Hexi won't\nstart!\n\n<a id='theloadfunction'></a>\n### 2. The `load` function, that runs while things are loading\n\nIf you supplied Hexi with a function called `load` when you initialized it, you can display a loading bar and loading progress information. Just create a function called `load`, like this:\n```js\nfunction load(){\n\n  //Display the file currently being loaded\n  console.log(`loading: ${g.loadingFile}`); \n\n  //Display the percentage of files currently loaded\n  console.log(`progress: ${g.loadingProgress}`);\n\n  //Add an optional loading bar \n  g.loadingBar();\n}\n```\n<a id='thesetupfunction'></a>\n### 3. The `setup` function, which initializes and creates your game objects\n\nNow that you've started Hexi and loaded all your files, you can start\nmaking things! This happens in the `setup` function. If you have any\nobjects or variables that you want to use across more than one\nfunction, define them outside the `setup` function, like this:\n```js\n//These things will be used in more than one function\nlet cats, message;\n\n//Use the `setup` function to create things\nfunction setup(){\n\n  //... create things here! ... \n}\n```\nLet's find out how the code inside the `setup` function works. We're going\nto be making cats - lots of cats! - so it's useful to create a `group` called\n`cats`to keep them all together.\n```js\ncats = g.group();\n```\nIn the Quick Start project you can make a new cat by tapping the\nscreen with the mouse (or touch.) So, we need a function that will\nproduce new cat **sprites** for us. (Sprites are interactive graphics that you can animate and move around the screen.) Hexi lets you create a new sprite using the `sprite` method. Just supply `sprite` with file name that you want to use for the sprite. Each new cat sprite that's created should be positioned and added add to the cats `group`, using the `addChild` method. We also want the cat to animate its scale using the `breathe` method and animate its transparency using the `pulse` method. A function called `makeCats` does all this. `makeCats` takes two arguments: the x and y\nposition where you want the cat to appear, relative to the top left corner of the screen.\n```js\nlet makeCat = (x, y) => {\n\n  //Create the cat sprite. Supply the `sprite` method with \n  //the name of the loaded image that should be displayed\n  let cat = g.sprite(\"images/cat.png\");\n\n  //Set the cat's position\n  cat.setPosition(x, y);\n\n  //You can alternatively set the position my modifying the sprite's `x` and\n  //`y` properties directly, like this\n  //cat.x = x;\n  //cat.y = y;\n\n  //Add some optional tween animation effects from the Hexi's \n  //built-in tween library (called Charm). `breathe` makes the\n  //sprite scale in and out. `pulse` oscillates its transparency\n  g.breathe(cat, 2, 2, 20);\n  g.pulse(cat, 10, 0.5);\n\n  //Set the cat's velocity to a random number between -10 and 10\n  cat.vx = g.randomInt(-10, 10);\n  cat.vy = g.randomInt(-10, 10);\n\n  //Add the cat to the `cats` group\n  cats.addChild(cat);\n};\n\n```\n(You can find out more about how the `breathe` and `pulse` methods work to\nanimate the cat in the [tweening example](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/blob/master/examples/src/tweening.js) in the [examples folder](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/tree/master/examples).)\n\nWe also need to create a `text` sprite to display the words \"Tap for\ncats!\" We can use Hexi's `text` method to do that.\n```js\nmessage = g.text(\"Tap for cats!\", \"38px puzzler\", \"red\");\n```\nThe `text` method's arguments are the text you want to display, the\nfont size and family, and the color (You can use any HTML/CSS color\nstring value, RGBA or HSLA values).\n\nUse Hexi's `putCenter` method to center the text inside the `stage`.\n```js\ng.stage.putCenter(message);\n```\nWhat's the `stage`? It's the root container that all Hexi sprites\nbelong to when they're first created. \n\nYou can also use `putLeft`, `putRight`, `putTop` or `putBottom` methods to help you align objects relative to other objects. The optional 2nd and 3rd arguments of these methods define the x and y offset, which help you fine-tune positioning.\n\nBecause we want the text message to rotate around its center point we\nhave to set its `pivotX` and `pivotY` values to 0.5.\n```js\nmessage.pivotX = 0.5;\nmessage.pivotY = 0.5;\n```\n0.5 means \"the very center of the sprite\".\n\nYou can also use this alternative syntax to set the pivot point:\n```js\nmessage.setPivot(0.5, 0.5);\n```\nWe need some way to tell Hexi to create a new cat whenever the screen\nis clicked or tapped. We also want the text message to tell us how many cats are currently on the screen. Hexi has a built in `pointer` object with a `tap` method that we can program to help us do this.\n```js\ng.pointer.tap = () => {\n  \n  //Supply `makeCat` with the pointer's `x` and `y` coordinates.\n  makeCat(g.pointer.x, g.pointer.y);\n\n  //Make the `message.content` display the number of cats \n  message.content = `${cats.children.length}`;\n};\n```\nWe also want the music file that we loaded to start playing. We can\naccess the music sound object with Hexi's `sound` method. Use the sound object's `loop`\nmethod to make it loop continuously, and use `play` to start it playing right away.\n```js\nlet music = g.sound(\"sounds/music.wav\");\nmusic.loop = true;\nmusic.play();\n```\nWe're now done setting everything up! That means we're finished with\nour application's `setup` state and can now switch the state to `play`. Here's how to do that: \n```js\ng.state = play;\n```\nThe `play` state is a function that will run in a loop, and is where\nall our application logic is. Let's find out how that works next.\n\n<a id='thesplayfunction'></a>\n### 4. The `play` function: the looping application logic\n\nThe last thing you need in your Hexi application is a `play` function.\n```js\nfunction play() {\n\n  //All this code will run in a loop\n}\n```\nThe `play` function is called in a continuous loop, at whatever fps\n(frames per second) value you set. This is your **game logic loop**. (The\nrender loop will be run by Hexi in the background at the maximum fps\nyour system can handle.) You can pause Hexi's game loop at any time\nwith the `pause` method, and restart it with the `resume` method.\n(Check out the [Flappy Fairy](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/blob/master/tutorials/src/flappyFairy.js) project to find out how `pause` and\n`resume` can be used to manage an application with complex states.)\n\nThe Quick Start project's `play` function just does two things: It\nmakes the text rotate, and moves and bounces the cats around the\nscreen. Here's the entire `play` function that does all this.\n```js\nfunction play() {\n  \n  //Rotate the text \n  message.rotation += 0.1;\n\n  //Loop through all of the cats to make them move and bounce off the\n  //edges of the stage\n  cats.children.forEach(cat => {\n\n    //Make the cat bounce off the screen edges\n    let collision = g.contain(cat, g.stage, true);\n\n    //Move the cat\n    g.move(cat);\n  });\n}\n```\nThat's all! Compared to all the work we put into the `setup` function, the\n`play` function does practically nothing! But how does it work?\n\nIt first makes the text rotate around its center by updating the\n`message` text sprite's `rotation` property by 0.1 radians.\n```js\nmessage.rotation += 0.1;\n```\nBecause this new rotation value is being applied to the old rotation value inside a continuous loop, it gradually increases the value and makes the text rotate.\n\nThe next thing the code does is loop through all the sprites in the\n`cat` group's `children` array.\n```js\ncats.children.forEach(cat => {\n  //Loop through each `cat` sprite in the `chidren` array\n});\n```\nAll Hexi groups have an array called `children` which\ntells you which sprites they contain. Whenever you add a sprite to a\ngroup using the `addChild` method, the sprite is added to the group's\n`children` array. Hexi's root container, called the `stage`, also has\na `children` array that contains all the sprites and groups in your\nHexi application. Even `sprite` objects have a `children` array, and\nthat means you can use `addChild` to group sprites with other sprites\nto create complex game objects.\n\nWhen the code loops through each cat, it first checks whether the cat\nis touching the edges of the screen and, if it is, it bounces it away\nin the opposite direction. Hexi's `contain` method helps us do this.\n```js\nlet collision = g.contain(cat, g.stage, true);\n```\nSetting the third argument to `true` is what causes the cat to bounce.\n\nThe cat moves around the screen with the help of the `move` method.\n```js\ng.move(cat);\n```\nThe `move` method updates the sprite's position by its `vx` and `vy` velocity values. (All Hexi sprites have `vx` and `vy` values, which are initialized to zero). You can move more than one sprite at a time by supplying `move` with a list of sprites, separated by commas. You can even supply it with an array that that contains all the sprites you want to move. Here's what `move` is actually doing under the hood:\n```js\ncat.x += cat.vx;\ncat.y += cat.vy;\n```\nAnd that's all there is to it! This is everything you know about the Quick Start application, and almost everything you need to know about Hexi!\n\n<a id='takingitfurther'></a>\n### Taking it further\n\nWith this basic Hexi architecture, you can create anything. Just set Hexi's `state` property to any other function to switch the behaviour of your application. Here's how:\n```js\ng.state = anyStateFunction;\n```\nStates are just plain old JavaScript funtctions!\nNice and simple!\n\nWrite as many state functions as you need. If it's a small project, you can keep all these functions in one file. But, for a big project, load your functions from external JS files as you need them. Use any module system you prefer, like ES6 modules, CommonJS, AMD, or good old HTML `<script>` tags.  This simple architectural model can scale to any size, and is the only architectural model you need to know. Keep it simple and stay happy!\n\nNow that you've got a broad overview of how Hexi works, read through\nthe tutorials to dive into the details.\n\n<a id='tutorials'></a>\nTutorials\n---------\n\nThe first game we're going to make is a simple object collection and\nenemy avoidance game called Treasure Hunter. Open the file\n`01_treasureHunter.html` in a web browser. (You'll find it in Hexi's\n`tutorials` folder, and you'll need to run it in a\n[webserver](https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server)). If you don't\nwant to bother setting up a webserver, use a text-editor like\n[Brackets](http://brackets.io) that will launch one for you\nautomatically (see Brackets' documentation for this feature).\n\n[![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/01.png)](https://gitcdn.xyz/repo/kittykatattack/hexi/master/tutorials/01_treasureHunter.html)\n\n(Follow the link in the image above to play the game.) Use the keyboard to move the explorer (the blue square), collect the\ntreasure (the yellow square), avoid the monsters (the red squares) and\nreach the exit (the green square.) Yes, you have to use your\nimagination - for now. \n\nHere's the complete JavaScript source code:\n\n[!Treasure Hunter Source](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/blob/master/tutorials/src/treasureHunter.js)\n\nDon't be fooled by it's apparent simplicity. Treasure Hunter contains\neverything a video game needs:\n\n- Interactivity\n- Collision\n- Sprites\n- A game loop\n- Scenes\n- game logic\n- \"Juice\" (in the form of sounds)\n\n(What's juice? [Watch this\nvideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg) and \n[read this article](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130848/how_to_prototype_a_game_in_under_7_.php?print=1) to learn\nabout this essential game design ingredient.)\n\nIf you can make a simple game like Treasure Hunter, you can make\nalmost any other kind of game. Yes, really! Getting from Treasure\nHunter to Skyrim or Zelda\nis just a matter of lots of small steps; adding more\ndetail as you go. How much detail you want to add is up to you. \n\nIn the first stage of this tutorial you'll learn how the basic\nTreasure Hunter game was made, and then we'll add some fun features like images and\ncharacter animation that will give you a complete overview of how the\nHexi works. \n\nIf you're an experienced game programmer and\nquick self-starter, you might find the code in [Hexi's `examples` folder](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/tree/master/examples) to\nbe a more productive place to start learning - check it out. The fully\ncommented\ncode in the `examples` folder also details specific, and advanced uses\nof features, that aren't\ncovered in these tutorials. When you're finished working through these\ntutorials, the `examples` will take you on the next stage of your\njourney.\n\n<a id='setingup'></a>\n#### Setting up the HTML container page\n\nBefore you can start programming in JavaScript, you need to set up a\nminimal HTML container page. The HTML page loads `hexi.min.js` which\nis the only file you need to use all of Hexi's\nfeatures. It also load the `treasureHunter.js` file, which is the\nJavaScript file that contains all the game code. \n```js\n<!doctype html>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<title>Treasure hunter</title>\n<body>\n<!-- Hexi -->\n<script src=\"../bin/hexi.min.js\"></script>\n\n<!-- Main application file -->\n<script src=\"bin/treasureHunter.js\"></script>\n</body>\n```\nThis is the [minimum amount of HTML code you need for a valid HTML5\ndocument](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9797046/whats-a-valid-html5-document).\n\nThe file paths may be different on your system, depending on how\nyou've set up your project file structure.\n\n<a id='initializing'></a>\n#### Initializing Hexi \n\nThe next step is to write some JavaScript code that initializes and starts Hexi \naccording to some parameters that you specify. This bit of\ncode below initializes a game with a screen size of 512 by 512 pixels.\nIt also pre-loads the `chimes.wav` sound file from the `sounds`\nfolder.\n```js\n//Initialize Hexi and load the chimes sound file\nlet g = hexi(512, 512, setup, [\"sounds/chimes.wav\"]);\n\n//Scale the game canvas to the maximum size in the browser\ng.scaleToWindow();\n\n//Start the Hexi engine.\ng.start();\n\n```\nYou can see that the result of the `hexi` function is being assigned to\nan variable called `g`. \n```js\nlet g = hexi(//...\n```\nNow, whenever you want to use any of Hexi's custom\nmethods or objects in your game, just prefix it with `g`. (You don't\nhave to use `g` to represent the game engine, you can use any variable\nname you want. `g` is just nice, short, and easy to remember; `g` =\n\"game\".)\n\nIn this example Hexi creates a canvas element with a size of 512 by 512\npixels. That's specified by the first two arguments:\n```js \n512, 512, setup,\n```\nThe third argument, `setup`, means that as soon as Hexi is initialized,\nit should look for and run a function in your game code called `setup`.\nWhatever code is in the `setup` function is entirely up to you, and\nyou'll soon see how you can used it to initialize a game. (You don't\nhave to call this function `setup`, you can use any name you like.) \n\nHexi lets you pre-load game assets with an optional 4th argument, which\nis an array of file names. In this first example, you only need to preload one file: `chimes.wav`\nYou can see that the full file path to `chimes.wav` is listed as a\nstring in the\ninitialization array:\n```js\n[\"sounds/chimes.wav\"]\n\n```\nYou can list as many game assets as you like here, including images,\nfonts, and JSON files. Hexi will load all these assets for you before\nrunning any of the game code.\n\nHexi just implement's [Pixi's superb resource loader](https://github.com/englercj/resource-loader)\nunder-the-hood.  You can access the loader directly through Hexi's `loader`\nproperty, and you can access the resources through the `resources` property. Or, just use `PIXI.loader` directly, if you want to. You can\nfind out more about [how Pixi's loader works here](https://github.com/kittykatattack/learningPixi#loading).\n\nWe want the game canvas to scale to\nthe maximum size of the browser window, so that it displays as large\nas possible. We can use a useful method called `scaleToWindow` to do\nthis for us.\n```js\ng.scaleToWindow();\n```\n`scaleToWindow` will center your game for the best fit. Long, wide\ngame screens are centered vertically. Tall or square screens are\ncentered horizontally. If you want to specify your own browser\nbackground color that borders the game, supply it in `scaleToWindow`'s\narguments, like this:\n```\ng.scaleToWindow(\"seaGreen\");\n```\nThe last thing you need to do is call Hexi's `start` method. \n```js\ng.start();\n```\nThis is the switch that turns the Hexi engine on.\n\n<a id='definingglobals'></a>\n#### Define your \"global\" variables\n\nAfter Hexi has been started, declare all the variables that your game\nfunctions will need to use.\n```js\nlet dungeon, player, treasure, enemies, chimes, exit,\n    healthBar, message, gameScene, gameOverScene;\n```\nBecause they're not enclosed inside a function, these variables are \"global\" \nin the sense that you can use them across all of your game functions.\n(They're not necessarily \"global\" in the sense that they inhabit the\nglobal JavaScript name-space. If you want to ensure that they aren't, [wrap all of\nyour JavaScript code in an enclosing **immediate function** to isolate it\nfrom the global\nspace](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17058606/why-using-self-executing-function-in-javascript). Or, if you want to\ndo it the fancy way, use JavaScript ES6/2015 [modules](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html) or [classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), to enforce local scope.\n\n<a id='setupfunction'></a>\n#### Initialize your game with a setup function\n\nAs soon as Hexi starts, it will look for and run a function in your game\ncode called `setup` (or whatever other name you want to give this\nfunction.) The `setup` function is only run once, and lets you perform\none-time setup tasks for your game. It's a great place to create and initialize\nobjects, create sprites, game scenes, populate data arrays or parse\nloaded JSON game data. \n\nHere's an abridged, birds-eye view of the `setup` function in Treasure Hunter,\nand the tasks that it performs.\n```js\nfunction setup() {\n  //Create the `chimes` sound object\n  //Create the `gameScene` group\n  //Create the `exit` door sprite\n  //Create the `player` sprite\n  //Create the `treasure` sprite\n  //Make the enemies\n  //Create the health bar\n  //Add some text for the game over message\n  //Create a `gameOverScene` group \n  //Assign the player's keyboard controllers\n\n  //set the game state to `play`\n  g.state = play;\n}\n```\nThe last line of code, `g.state = play` is perhaps the most important\nbecause it starts the `play` function. The `play` function runs all the game logic\nin a loop. But before we look at how that works, let's see what the\nspecific code inside the `setup` function does.\n\n<a id='creatingsound'></a>\n##### Creating the `chimes` sound object\n\nYou'll remember from the code above that we preloaded a sound file\ninto the game called `chimes.wav`. Before you can use it in your game,\nyou have to make a reference to it using Hexi's `sound` method,\nlike this:\n```js\nchimes = g.sound(\"sounds/chimes.wav\");\n```\n<a id='gamescenes'></a>\n##### Creating game scenes\n\nHexi has a useful method called `group` that lets you group game objects\ntogether so that you can work with them as one unit. Groups are used for\ngrouping together special objects called **sprites**  (which you'll\nlearn all about in the next section.) But they're also used for making game scenes. \n\nTreasure Hunter uses two game scenes: `gameScene` which is the main game, \nand `gameOverScene` which is displayed when the game is finished. \nHere's how the `gameScene` is made using the `group` method:\n```js\ngameScene = g.group();\n```\nAfter you've made the group, you can add sprites (game objects) to the `gameScene`, using\nthe `addChild` method.\n```js    \ngameScene.addChild(anySprite);\n```\nOr, you can add multiple sprites at one time with the `add` method, like this:\n```js\ngameScene.add(spriteOne, spriteTwo, spriteThree);\n```\nOr, if you prefer, you can create the game scene after you've made all\nthe sprites, and group all the sprites together with one line of code, like this:\n```js\ngameScene = g.group(spriteOne, spriteTwp, spriteThree);\n```\nYou'll see a few different examples of how to add sprites to groups in\nthe examples ahead.\n\nBut what are sprites, and how do you make them?\n\n<a id='makingsprites'></a>\n##### Making sprites\n\nSprites are the most important elements in any game. Sprites are\njust graphics (shapes or images) that you can control with\nspecial properties. Everything you can see in your games, like\ngame characters, objects and backgrounds, are sprites. Hexi lets you make\n5 kinds of basic sprites: `rectangle`, `circle`, `line`, `text`, and\n`sprite` (an image-based sprite). You can make almost any 2D action game\nwith these basic sprite types. (If they aren't enough, you can also define your own custom\nsprite types.) This first version of Treasure Hunter\nonly uses `rectangle` sprites. You can make a rectangle sprite like\nthis:\n```js\nlet box = g.rectangle(\n  widthInPixels, \n  heightInPixels, \n  \"fillColor\", \n  \"strokeColor\", \n  lineWidth, \n  xPosition, \n  yPosition\n);\n```\nYou can use Hexi's `circle` method to make a circular shaped sprite:\n```js\nlet ball = g.circle(\n  diameterInPixels, \n  \"fillColor\", \n  \"strokeColor\", \n  lineWidth,\n  xPosition, \n  yPosition \n);\n```\nIt's often useful to prototype a new game using only `rectangle` and\n`circle` sprites, because that can help you focus on the mechanics of your\ngame in a pure, elemental way. That's what this first version of\nTreasure Hunter does. Here's the code from the `setup` function that\ncreates the `exit`, `player` and `treasure` sprites.\n```js\n//The exit door\nexit = g.rectangle(48, 48, \"green\");\nexit.x = 8;\nexit.y = 8;\ngameScene.addChild(exit);\n\n//The player sprite\nplayer = g.rectangle(32, 32, \"blue\");\nplayer.x = 68;\nplayer.y = g.canvas.height / 2 - player.halfHeight;\ngameScene.addChild(player);\n\n//Create the treasure\ntreasure = g.rectangle(16, 16, \"gold\");\n\n//Position it next to the left edge of the canvas\ntreasure.x = g.canvas.width - treasure.width - 10;\ntreasure.y = g.canvas.height / 2 - treasure.halfHeight;\n\n//Alternatively, you could use Ga's built in convience method\n//called `putCenter` to postion the sprite like this:\n//g.stage.putCenter(treasure, 208, 0);\n\n//Create a `pickedUp` property on the treasure to help us Figure\n//out whether or not the treasure has been picked up by the player\ntreasure.pickedUp = false;\n\n//Add the treasure to the `gameScene`\ngameScene.addChild(treasure);\n``` \nNotice that after each sprite is created, it's added to the\n`gameScene` using `addChild`. Here's what the above code produces:\n\n![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/03.png)\n\nLet's find out a little more about how these sprites are positioned on\nthe canvas.\n\n<a id='positioningsprites'></a>\n##### Positioning sprites\n\nAll sprites have `x` and `y` properties that you can use to precisely\nposition sprites on the canvas. The `x` and `y` values refer to the sprites' pixel\ncoordinates relative to the canvas's top left corner. The top\nleft corner has `x` and `y` values of 0. That means any\npositive `x` and `y` values you assign to sprites will position them left (`x`) and down\n(`y`) relative to that corner point. For example, Here's the\ncode that positions the `exit` door (the green square). \n```js\nexit.x = 8;\nexit.y = 8;\n```\nYou can see that this code places the door 8 pixel to the right and 8 pixels below the\ncanvas's top left corner. Positive `x` values position sprites to the\nright of the canvas's left edge. Positive `y` values position them\nbelow the canvas's top edge.\n\nSprites also have `width` and `height`\nproperties that tell you their width and height in pixels. If you need\nto find out what half the width or half the height of a sprite is, use\n`halfWidth` and `halfHeight`.\n\nHexi also has a some convenience methods that help you quickly position\nsprites relative to other sprites: `putTop`, `putRight`, `putBottom`, `putLeft` and `putCenter`.\nFor example, here are the lines from the code above that\nposition the treasure sprite (the gold box). The code places the\ntreasure 26 pixels to the left of the\ncanvas's right edge, and centers it vertically.\n```js\ntreasure.x = g.canvas.width - treasure.width - 10;\ntreasure.y = g.canvas.height / 2 - treasure.halfHeight;\n```\nThat's a lot of complicated positioning code to write. Instead, you\ncould use Hexi's built-in `putCenter` method to achieve the same effect\nlike this:\n```js\ng.stage.putCenter(treasure, 220, 0);\n```\nWhat is the `stage`? It's the root container for all the sprites, and\nhas exactly the same dimensions as the canvas. You can think of the\n`stage` as a big, invisible sprite, the same size as the canvas, that contains\nall the sprites in your game, as well as any containers those sprites\nmight be grouped in (Like the `gameScene`). `putCenter` works by\ncentering the `treasure` inside the `stage`, and then offsetting its\n`x` position by 220 pixels. Here's the format for using `putCenter`:\n```js\nanySprite.putCenter(anyOtherSprite, xOffset, yOffset);\n```\nYou can use the other `put` methods in the same way. For example, if\nyou wanted to position a sprite directly to the left of another\nsprite, without any offset, you could use `putLeft`, like this:\n```js\nspriteOne.putLeft(spriteTwo);\n```\nThis would place `spriteTwo` directly to the left of `spriteOne`, and\nalign it vertically .You'll see many examples of how to use these `put` methods throughout\nthese tutorials.\n\n<a id='dynamicproperties'></a>\n##### Assigning dynamic properties\n\nBefore we continue, there's one small detail you need to notice. The\ncode that creates the sprites also adds a `pickedUp` property to the\n`treasure` sprite:\n```js\ntreasure.pickedUp = false;\n```\nYou'll see how we're going to use `treasure.pickedUp` later in the game logic to help us determine the\nprogress of the game. You can dynamically assign any custom properties or methods to sprites like this, if you need to.\n\n<a id='enemysprites'></a>\n##### Creating the enemy sprites\n\nThere are 6 enemies sprites (red squares) in Treasure Hunter. They're\nspaced evenly horizontally but but have random initial vertical\npositions. All the enemies sprites are created in a `for` loop using\nthis code in the `setup` function:\n```js\n//Make the enemies\nlet numberOfEnemies = 6,\n    spacing = 48,\n    xOffset = 150,\n    speed = 2,\n    direction = 1;\n\n//An array to store all the enemies    \nenemies = [];\n\n//Make as many enemies as there are `numberOfEnemies`\nfor (let i = 0; i < numberOfEnemies; i++) {\n\n  //Each enemy is a red rectangle\n  let enemy = g.rectangle(32, 32, \"red\");\n\n  //Space each enemey horizontally according to the `spacing` value.\n  //`xOffset` determines the point from the left of the screen\n  //at which the first enemy should be added.\n  let x = spacing * i + xOffset;\n\n  //Give the enemy a random y position\n  let y = g.randomInt(0, g.canvas.height - enemy.height);\n\n  //Set the enemy's direction\n  enemy.x = x;\n  enemy.y = y;\n\n  //Set the enemy's vertical velocity. `direction` will be either `1` or\n  //`-1`. `1` means the enemy will move down and `-1` means the enemy will\n  //move up. Multiplying `direction` by `speed` determines the enemy's\n  //vertical direction\n  enemy.vy = speed * direction;\n\n  //Reverse the direction for the next enemy\n  direction *= -1;\n\n  //Push the enemy into the `enemies` array\n  enemies.push(enemy);\n\n  //Add the enemy to the `gameScene`\n  gameScene.addChild(enemy);\n}\n\n```\nHere's what this code produces:\n\n![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/04.png)\n\nThe code gives each of the enemies a random `y` position with the help\nof Hexi's `randomInt` method:\n```js\nlet y = g.randomInt(0, g.canvas.height - enemy.height);\n```\n`randomInt` will give you a random number between any two integers that you\nprovide in the arguments. (If you need a random decimal number, use\n`randomFloat` instead).\n\nAll sprites have properties called `vx` and `vy`. They determine the\nspeed and direction that the sprite will move in the horizontal\ndirection (`vx`) and vertical direction (`vy`).  The enemies in\nTreasure Hunter only move up and down, so they just need a `vy` value.\nTheir `vy` is `speed` (2) multiplied by `direction` (which will be\neither `1` or `-1`).\n```js\nenemy.vy = speed * direction;\n```\nIf `direction` is `1`, the enemy's `vy` will be `2`. That means the\nenemy will move down the screen at a rate of 2 pixels per frame. If\n`direction` is `-1`, the enemy's speed will be `-2`. That means the\nenemy will move up the screen at 2 pixels per frame. \n\nAfter the enemy's `vy` is set, `direction` is reversed so that the next\nenemy will move in the opposite direction.\n```js\ndirection *= -1;\n```\nYou can see that each enemy that's created is pushed into an array\ncalled `enemies`.\n```js\nenemies.push(enemy);\n```\nLater in the code you'll see how we'll access all the enemies in this\narray to figure out if they're touching the player.\n\n<a id='healthbar'></a>\n##### The health bar\n\nYou'll notice that when the player\ntouches one of the enemies, the width of the health bar at the top right corner of\nthe screen decreases. \n\n![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/05.png)\n\nHow was this health bar made? It's just two rectangle sprites at the same\nposition: a black rectangle behind, and a green rectangle in front. They're grouped\ntogether to make a single compound sprite called `healthBar`. The\n`healthBar` is then added to the `gameScene`.\n```js\n//Create the health bar\nlet outerBar = g.rectangle(128, 16, \"black\"),\n    innerBar = g.rectangle(128, 16, \"yellowGreen\");\n\n//Group the inner and outer bars\nhealthBar = g.group(outerBar, innerBar);\n\n//Set the `innerBar` as a property of the `healthBar`\nhealthBar.inner = innerBar;\n\n//Position the health bar\nhealthBar.x = g.canvas.width - 148;\nhealthBar.y = 16;\n\n//Add the health bar to the `gameScene`\ngameScene.addChild(healthBar);\n```\nYou can see that a property called `inner` has been added to the\n`healthBar`. It just references the `innerBar` (the green rectangle) so that\nit will be convenient to access later.\n```js\nhealthBar.inner = innerBar;\n```\nYou don't *have* to do this; but, hey why not! It means that if you\nwant to control the width of the `innerBar`, you can write some smooth code\nthat looks like this:\n```js\nhealthBar.inner.width = 30;\n```\nThat's pretty neat and readable, so we'll keep it!\n\n<a id='gameoverscene'></a>\n##### The game over scene\n\nIf the player's health drops to zero, or the player manages to\ncarry the treasure to the exit, the game ends and the game over screen\nis displayed.  The game over scene is just some text that displays \"You won!\" or \"You\nlost!\" depending on the outcome. \n\n![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/06.png)\n\nHow was this made? The text is made with a `text` sprite. \n```js\nlet anyText = g.text(\n  \"Hello!\", \"CSS font properties\", \"fillColor\", xPosition, yPosition\n);\n```\nThe first argument, \"Hello!\" in the above example, is the text content\nyou want to display. Use the `content` property to change the text\nsprite's content later.\n```js\nanyText.content = \"Some new content\";\n```\nHere's how the game over message text is created in the `setup`\nfunction. \n```js\n//Add some text for the game over message\nmessage = g.text(\"Game Over!\", \"64px Futura\", \"black\", 20, 20);\nmessage.x = 120;\nmessage.y = g.canvas.height / 2 - 64;\n```\nNext, a new `group` is created called `gameOverScene`. The `message` text\nis added to it. The `gameOverScene`'s `visible` property is set to\n`false` so that it's not visible when the game first starts.\n```js\n//Create a `gameOverScene` group and add the message sprite to it\ngameOverScene = g.group(message);\n\n//Make the `gameOverScene` invisible for now\ngameOverScene.visible = false;\n```\nAt the end of the game we'll set the `gameOverScene`'s `visible`\nproperty to `true` to display the text message. We'll also set the\n`gameScene`'s `visible` property to `false` so that all the game\nsprites are hidden.\n\n<a id='keyboard'></a>\n##### Keyboard interactivity\n\nYou control the player (the blue square) with the keyboard arrow keys.\nHexi has a built-in `arrowControl` method that lets you quickly add\narrow key interactivity to games. Supply the sprite you want to move as \nthe first argument, and the number of pixels per frame that it \nshould move as the second argument. Here's how the `arrowControl`\nmethod is used to help make the player character move 5 pixels per\nframe when the arrow keys are pressed.\n```js\ng.arrowControl(player, 5);\n```\nUsing `arrowControl` is an easy and fast way to implement keyboard\ninteractivity, but usually need finer control over what happens when\nkeys are pressed. Hexi has a built-in `keyboard` method that lets you define custom keys.\n\n```js\nlet customKey = g.keyboard(asciiCode);\n```\nSupply the [ascii key code number](http://www.asciitable.com) for key\nyou want to to use as the first argument.\n\nAll these keys have `press` and\n`release` methods that you can define. Here's how you could optionally create and use these keyboard objects to help move the player character in\nTreasure Hunter. (You would define this code in the `setup` function.):\n```js\n//Create some keyboard objects using Hexi's `keyboard` method.\n//You would usually use this code in the `setup` function.\n//Supply the ASCII key code value as the single argument\nlet leftArrow = g.keyboard(37),\n    upArrow = g.keyboard(38),\n    rightArrow = g.keyboard(39),\n    downArrow = g.keyboard(40);\n\n//Left arrow key `press` method\nleftArrow.press = () => {\n  //Change the player's velocity when the key is pressed\n  player.vx = -5;\n  player.vy = 0;\n};\n\n//Left arrow key `release` method\nleftArrow.release = () => {\n  //If the left arrow has been released, and the right arrow isn't down,\n  //and the player isn't moving vertically:\n  //Stop the player\n  if (!rightArrow.isDown && player.vy === 0) {\n    player.vx = 0;\n  }\n};\n\n//The up arrow\nupArrow.press = () => {\n  player.vy = -5;\n  player.vx = 0;\n};\nupArrow.release = () => {\n  if (!downArrow.isDown && player.vx === 0) {\n    player.vy = 0;\n  }\n};\n\n//The right arrow\nrightArrow.press = () => {\n  player.vx = 5;\n  player.vy = 0;\n};\nrightArrow.release = () => {\n  if (!leftArrow.isDown && player.vy === 0) {\n    player.vx = 0;\n  }\n};\n\n//The down arrow\ndownArrow.press = () => {\n  player.vy = 5;\n  player.vx = 0;\n};\ndownArrow.release = () => {\n  if (!upArrow.isDown && player.vx === 0) {\n    player.vy = 0;\n  }\n};\n\n```\nYou can see that the value of the player's `vx` and `vy` properties is\nchanged depending on which keys are being pressed or released.\nA positive `vx` value will make the player move right, a negative\nvalue will make it move left. A positive `vy` value will make the\nplayer move down, a negative value will make it move up. \n\nThe first argument is the sprite you want to control: `player`. The\nsecond argument is the number of pixels that the sprite should move each frame: `5`.\nThe last four arguments are the [ascii key code numbers](http://www.asciitable.com) for the top,\nright, bottom and left keys. (You can remember this because their\norder is listed clockwise, starting from the top.)\n\n\n<a id='gamestate'></a>\n##### Setting the game state\n\nThe **game state** is the function that Hexi is currently running. When\nHexi first starts, it runs the `setup` function (or whatever other\nfunction you specify in Hexi's constructor function arguments.) If you\nwant to change the game state, assign a new function to Hexi's `state`\nproperty. Here's how:\n```js\ng.state = anyFunction;\n```\nIn Treasure Hunter, when the `setup` function is finished, the game\n`state` is set to `play`:\n```js\ng.state = play;\n```\nThis makes Hexi look for and run a function called `play`. By default,\nany function assigned to the game state will run in a continuous loop, at\n60 frames per second. (You can change the frame rate at any time by setting Hexi's\n`fps` property). Game logic usually runs in a continuous loop, which\nis known as the **game loop**. Hexi handles the loop management for you,\nso you don't need to worry about how it works. \n\n(In case you're curious, Hexi uses\na `requestAnimationFrame` loop with a [fixed logic time step and variable rendering time](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html). It\nalso does sprite position interpolation to smoothe out any inconsistent\nspikes in the frame rate. It runs [Smoothie](https://github.com/kittykatattack/smoothie)\nunder-the-hood to do all this, so you can use any of Smoothie's properties to\nfine-tune your Hexi application game loops for the best possible effect.)\n\nIf you ever need to pause the loop, just use Hexi's `pause`method, like\nthis:\n```js\ng.pause();\n```\nYou can start the game loop again with the `resume` method, like this:\n```js\ng.resume();\n```\nNow let's find out how Treasure Hunter's `play` function works. \n\n<a id='gamelogic'></a>\n#### Game logic with the play function loop\n\nAs you've just learned, everything in the `play` function runs in a\ncontinuous loop.\n```js\nfunction play() {\n  //This code loops from top to bottom 60 times per second  \n}\n```\nThis is where all the game logic happens. It's the fun part,\nso let's find out what the code inside the `play` function does.\n\n<a id='movingplayer'></a>\n##### Moving the player sprite\n\nTreasure Hunter uses Hexi's `move` method inside the `play` function to move the sprites in the\ngame.\n```js\ng.move(player);\n```\nThis is the equivalent of writing code like this:\n```js\nplayer.x += player.vx;\nplayer.y += player.vy;\n```\nIt just updates the player's `x` and `y` position by adding its `vx`\nand `vy` velocity values. (Remember, those values were\nset by the key `press` and `release` methods.) Using `move` just saves\nyou from having to type-in and look-at this very standard boilerplate\ncode.\n\nYou can also move a whole array of sprites with one line of code by\nsupplying the array as the argument.\n```js\ng.move(arrayOfSprites);\n```\nSo now you can easily move the player, but what happens when the\nplayer reaches the edges of the screen?\n\n<a id='boundries'></a>\n##### Containing sprites inside the screen boundaries\n\nUse Hexi's `contain` method to keep sprites inside the boundaries of\nthe screen.\n```js\ng.contain(player, g.stage);\n```\nThe first argument is the sprite you want to contain, and the second\nargument is any JavaScript object with an `x`, `y`, `width`, and\n`height` property. \n\nAs you learnt earlier, `stage` is the root container object for all Hexi's sprites, and it has\nthe same width and height as the `canvas`. \n\nBut you can alternatively supply the `contain` method with a custom \nobject to do the same thing. Here's how:\n\n```js\ng.contain(\n  player, \n  {\n    x: 0,\n    y: 0,\n    width: 512,\n    height: 512\n  }\n);\n```\nThis will contain the `player` sprite to an area defined by the\ndimensions of the object. This is really convenient if you want to\nprecisely fine-tune the area in which the object should be contained.\n\n`contain` has an extra useful feature. If the sprite reaches one of\nthe containment edges, `contain` will return a [JavaScript Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) that tells you\nwhich edge it reached: \"top\", \"right\", \"bottom\", or \"left\". Here's how\nyou could use this feature to find out which edge of the canvas the\nsprite is touching:\n\n```js\nlet playerHitsEdges = g.contain(player, g.stage);\n\nif(playerHitsEdges) {\n\n  //Find out on which side the collision happened\n  let collisionSide;\n  if (playerHitsEdges.has(\"left\")) collisionSide = \"left\";\n  if (playerHitsEdges.has(\"right\")) collisionSide = \"right\";\n  if (playerHitsEdges.has(\"top\")) collisionSide = \"top\";\n  if (playerHitsEdges.has(\"bottom\")) collisionSide = \"bottom\";\n\n  //Display the result in a text sprite\n  message.content = `The player hit the ${collisionSide} of the canvas`; \n} \n```\n<a id='collisionenemy'></a>\n##### Collision with the enemies\n\nWhen the player hits any of the enemies, the width of the health bar\ndecreases and the player becomes semi-transparent.\n\n![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/07.png)\n\nHow does this work?\n\nHexi has a full suite of useful 2D geometric and tile-based collision\ndetection methods. Hexi implements the [Bump collision module](https://github.com/kittykatattack/bump) so all\nof Bump's collision methods work with Hexi. \n\nTreasure Hunter only uses one of these collision methods:\n`hitTestRectangle`. It takes two rectangular sprites and tells you\nwhether they're overlapping. It will return `true` if they are, and\n`false` if they aren't.\n```js\ng.hitTestRectangle(spriteOne, spriteTwo);\n```\nHere's how the code in the `play` function uses `hitTestRectangle` to\ncheck for a collision between any of the enemies and the player.\n```js\n//Set `playerHit` to `false` before checking for a collision\nlet playerHit = false;\n\n//Loop through all the sprites in the `enemies` array\nenemies.forEach(enemy => {\n\n  //Move the enemy\n  g.move(enemy);\n\n  //Check the enemy's screen boundaries\n  let enemyHitsEdges = g.contain(enemy, g.stage);\n\n  //If the enemy hits the top or bottom of the stage, reverse\n  //its direction\n  if (enemyHitsEdges) {\n    if (enemyHitsEdges.has(\"top\") || enemyHitsEdges.has(\"bottom\")) {\n      enemy.vy *= -1;\n    }\n  }\n\n  //Test for a collision. If any of the enemies are touching\n  //the player, set `playerHit` to `true`\n  if (g.hitTestRectangle(player, enemy)) {\n   playerHit = true;\n  }\n});\n\n//If the player is hit...\nif (playerHit) {\n\n  //Make the player semi-transparent\n  player.alpha = 0.5;\n\n  //Reduce the width of the health bar's inner rectangle by 1 pixel\n  healthBar.inner.width -= 1;\n} else {\n\n  //Make the player fully opaque (non-transparent) if it hasn't been hit\n  player.alpha = 1;\n}\n```\nThis bit of code creates a variable called `playerHit`, which is\ninitialized to `false` just before the `forEach` loop checks all the\nenemies for a collision.\n```js\nlet playerHit = false;\n```\n(Because the `play` function runs 60 times per second, `playerHit`\nwill be reinitialized to `false` on every new frame.)\n\nIf `hitTestRectangle` returns `true`, the `forEach` loop sets\n`playerHit` to `true`.\n```js\nif(g.hitTestRectangle(player, enemy)) {\n  playerHit = true;\n}\n```\nIf the player has been hit, the code makes the player semi-transparent by\nsetting its `alpha` value to 0.5. It also reduces the width of the\n`healthBar`'s `inner` sprite by 1 pixel.\n```js\nif(playerHit) {\n\n  //Make the player semi-transparent\n  player.alpha = 0.5;\n\n  //Reduce the width of the health bar's inner rectangle by 1 pixel\n  healthBar.inner.width -= 1;\n\n} else {\n\n  //Make the player fully opaque (non-transparent) if it hasn't been hit\n  player.alpha = 1;\n}\n```\nYou can set the `alpha` property of sprites to any value between `0`\n(fully transparent) to `1` (fully opaque). A value of `0.5` makes it\nsemi-transparent.b (**Alpha** is a\nwell-worn graphic design term that just means **transparency**.)\n\nThis bit of code also uses the `move` method to move the enemies, and\n`contain` to keep them contained inside the canvas. The code also uses\nthe return value of `contain` to find out if the enemy is hitting the\ntop or bottom of the canvas. If it hits the top or bottom, the enemy's direction is\nreversed with the help of this code:\n```js\n//Check the enemy's screen boundaries\nlet enemyHitsEdges = g.contain(enemy, g.stage);\n\n//If the enemy hits the top or bottom of the stage, reverse\n//its direction\nif (enemyHitsEdges) {\n  if (enemyHitsEdges.has(\"top\") || enemyHitsEdges.has(\"bottom\")) {\n    enemy.vy *= -1;\n  }\n}\n```\nMultiplying the enemy's `vy` (vertical velocity) value by negative 1\nmakes it go in the opposite direction. It's a really simple **bounce**\neffect.\n\n<a id='collisiontreasure'></a>\n###### Collision with the treasure\n\nIf the player touches the treasure (the yellow square), the `chimes`\nsound plays. The player can then\ncarry the treasure to the exit. The treasure is centered over the player and\nmoves along with it. \n\n![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/08.png)\n\nHere's the code from the `play` function that achieves these effects.\n\n```js\n//Check for a collision between the player and the treasure\nif (g.hitTestRectangle(player, treasure)) {\n\n  //If the treasure is touching the player, center it over the player\n  treasure.x = player.x + 8;\n  treasure.y = player.y + 8;\n\n  if(!treasure.pickedUp) {\n\n    //If the treasure hasn't already been picked up,\n    //play the `chimes` sound\n    chimes.play();\n    treasure.pickedUp = true;\n  };\n}\n```\nYou can see that the code uses `hitTestRectangle` inside an `if`\nstatement to test for a collision between the player and the treasure.\n```js\nif (g.hitTestRectangle(player, treasure)) {\n```\nIf it's `true`, the treasure is centered over the player.\n```js\ntreasure.x = player.x + 8;\ntreasure.y = player.y + 8;\n```\nIf `treasure.pickedUp` is `false`, then you know that the treasure hasn't already been \npicked up, and you can play the `chimes` sound:\n```js\nchimes.play();\n```\nIn addition to `play` Hexi's sound objects also have a few more methods that you can use to control them:\n`pause`, `restart` and `playFrom`. (Use `playFrom` to start playing\nthe sound from a specific second in the sound file, like this:\n`soundObject.playFrom(5)`. This will make the sound start playing from\nthe 5 second mark.)\n\nYou can also set the sound object's `volume` by assigning\na value between 0 and 1. Here's how to set the `volume` to mid-level\n(50%).\n```js\nsoundObject.volume = 0.5;\n```\nYou can set the sound object's `pan` by assigning a value between -1 (left speaker)\nto 1 (right speaker). A pan value of 0 makes the sound equal volume in\nboth speakers. Here's how you could set the `pan` to be slightly more\nprominent in the left speaker.\n```js\nsoundObject.pan = -0.2;\n```\nIf you want to make a sound repeat continuously, set its `loop` property to `true`.\n```js\nsoundObject.loop = true;\n```\nHexi implements the [Sound.js module](https://github.com/kittykatattack/sound.js) to control sounds, so you\ncan use any of Sound.js's properties and methods in your Hexi\napplications.\n\nBecause you don't want to play the `chimes` sound more than once after\nthe treasure has been picked up, the code sets `treasure.pickedUp` to\n`true` just after the sound plays.\n```js\ntreasure.pickedUp = true;\n```\nNow that the player has picked up the treasure, how can you check for\nthe end of the game?\n\n<a id='endinggame1'></a>\n##### Ending the game\n\nThere are two ways the game can end. The player's health can run out,\nin which case the game is lost. Or, the player can successfully carry\nthe treasure to the exit, in which case the game is won. If either of\nthese two conditions are met,  the game's `state` is set to `end` and\nthe `message` text's `content` displays the outcome. Here's the last\nbit of code in the `play` function that does this:\n```js\n//Does the player have enough health? If the width of the `innerBar`\n//is less than zero, end the game and display \"You lost!\"\nif (healthBar.inner.width < 0) {\n  g.state = end;\n  message.content = \"You lost!\";\n}\n\n//If the player has brought the treasure to the exit,\n//end the game and display \"You won!\"\nif (g.hitTestRectangle(treasure, exit)) {\n  g.state = end;\n  message.content = \"You won!\";\n}\n```\nThe `end` function is really simple. It just hides the `gameScene` and\ndisplays the `gameOverScene`.\n```js\nfunction end() {\n  gameScene.visible = false;\n  gameOverScene.visible = true;\n}\n```\nAnd that's it for Treasure Hunter! Before you continue, try making\nyour own game from scratch using some of these same techniques. When\nyou're ready, read on!\n\n<a id='usingimages'></a>\n### Using images\n\nThere are three main ways you can use images in your Hexi games. \n\n- Use individual image files for each sprite.\n- Use a **texture atlas**. This is a single image file that includes\n  sub-images for each sprite in your game. The image file is\n  accompanied by a matching JSON\n  data file that describes the name, size and location of each\n  sub-image.\n- Use a **tileset** (also known as a **spritesheet**). This is also a single\n  image file that includes sub-images for each sprite. However, unlike a\n  texture atlas, it doesn't come with a JSON file describing the\n  sprite data. Instead, you need to specify the size and location of\n  each sprite in your game code with JavaScript. This can have some\n  advantages over a texture atlas in certain circumstances.\n\nAll three ways of making image sprites use Hexi's `sprite` method.\nHere's the simplest way of using it to make an image sprite.\n```js\nlet imageSprite = g.sprite(\"images/theSpriteImage.png\");\n```\nIn this next section we'll update Treasure Hunter with image sprites, and\nyou'll learn all three ways of adding images to your games.\n\n(All the images in this section were created by Lanea Zimmerman. You\ncan find more of her artwork [here](http://opengameart.org/users/sharm). Thanks, Lanea!)\n\n<a id='individualimages'></a>\n#### Individual images\n\nOpen and play the next version of Treasure Hunter:\n`02_treasureHunterImages.html` (you'll find it in the `tutorials`\nfolder.) It plays exactly the same as the first version, but all the\ncolored squares have been replaced by images.\n\n[![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/09.png)](https://cdn.gitcdn.xyz/cdn/kittykatattack/hexi/7349658f295c120ca7f3bab94d31379a0c02952e/tutorials/02_treasureHunterImages.html)\n\n(Click the image and follow the link to play the game.) Take a look at the source code, and you'll notice that the game logic\nand structure is exactly the same as the first version of the game.\nThe only thing that's changed is the appearance of the sprites.\nHow was this done?\n\n<a id='loadingimagefile'></a>\n##### Loading image files \n\nEach sprite in the game uses an individual PNG image file. You'll find\nall the images in the tutorials' `images` sub-folder.\n\n![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/10.png)\n\nBefore you can use them to make sprites, you need to pre-load them into\nHexi's `assets`. The easiest way to do this is to list the image names,\nwith their full file paths, in Hexi's assets array when you first\ninitialize the engine. Create an array called `thingsToLoad`, list the\nfile names, as strings, that you want to load. Then supply that array\nas the `hexi` method's fourth argument. Here's how:\n```js\n//An array that contains all the files you want to load\nlet thingsToLoad = [\n  \"images/explorer.png\",\n  \"images/dungeon.png\",\n  \"images/blob.png\",\n  \"images/treasure.png\",\n  \"images/door.png\",\n  \"sounds/chimes.wav\"\n];\n\n//Create a new Hexi instance, and start it\nlet g = hexi(512, 512, setup, thingsToLoad);\n\n//Start Hexi\ng.start();\n```\n(If you open up the JavaScript console in the web browser, you can\nmonitor the loading progress of these assets.)\n\nNow you can access any of these images in your game code like this:\n```js\ng.image(\"images/blob.png\")\n```\nAlthough pre-loading the images and other assets is the simplest way\nto get them into your game, you can also load assets at any other time\nusing the `loader` object and its methods. As I mentioned earlier,\nthe `loader` is just an alias for Pixi's loader that's running\nunder-the-hood, and you can [learn more about how to use it here](https://github.com/kittykatattack/learningPixi#loading).\n\nNow that you've loaded the images into the game, let's find out how to\nuse them to make sprites.\n\n<a id='makingsprites'></a>\n##### Making sprites with images\n\nCreate an image sprite using the `sprite` method using the same format you learnt\nearlier. Here's how to create a sprite using the `dungeon.png` image.\n(`dungeon.png` is a 512 by 512 pixel background image.)\n```js\ndungeon = g.sprite(\"images/dungeon.png\");\n```\nThat's all! Now instead of displaying as a simple colored rectangle,\nthe sprite will be displayed as a 512 by 512 image. There's no need\nto specify the width or height, because Hexi figures that our for you\nautomatically based on the size of the image. You can use all the other\nsprite properties, like `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height`, just as you\nwould with ordinary rectangle sprites. \n\nHere's the code from the `setup` function that creates the dungeon\nbackground, exit door, player and treasure, and adds them all to the\n`gameScene` group. \n```js\n//The dungeon background\ndungeon = g.sprite(\"images/dungeon.png\");\n\n//The exit door\nexit = g.sprite(\"images/door.png\");\nexit.x = 32;\n\n//The player sprite\nplayer = g.sprite(\"images/explorer.png\");\nplayer.x = 68;\nplayer.y = g.canvas.height / 2 - player.halfWidth;\n\n//Create the treasure\ntreasure = g.sprite(\"images/treasure.png\");\n\n//Position it next to the left edge of the canvas\n//g.stage.putCenter(treasure, 208, 0);\n\n//Create a `pickedUp` property on the treasure to help us Figure\n//out whether or not the treasure has been picked up by the player\ntreasure.pickedUp = false;\n\n//Create the `gameScene` group and add the sprites\ngameScene = g.group(dungeon, exit, player, treasure);\n```\n(As a slightly more efficient improvement to the\noriginal version of this code, `group` creates the `gameScene` and groups\nthe sprites in a single step.)\n\nLook familiar? That's right, the only code that has changed are the\nlines that create the sprites. This modularity is a feature of Hexi that lets you create quick\ngame prototypes using simple shapes that you can easily swap out for\ndetailed images as your game ideas develops. The rest of the code in the\ngame can remain as-is.\n\n<a id='finetuning'></a>\n##### Fine-tuning the containment area\n\nOne small improvement that was made to this new version Treasure\nHunter is the new way that the sprites are contained inside the walls of the\ndungeon. They're contained in such a way that naturally matches the 2.5D perspective of the artwork, as shown by the green square in this screen shot:\n\n![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/11.png)\n\nThis is a very easy modification to make. All you need to do is supply\nthe `contain` method with a custom object that defines the size and\nposition of the containing rectangle. Here's how:\n```js\ng.contain(\n  player,\n  {\n    x: 32, y: 16,\n    width: g.canvas.width - 32,\n    height: g.canvas.height - 32\n  }\n);\n```\nJust tweak the `x`, `y`, `width` and `height` values so that the\ncontaining area looks natural for the game you're making.\n\n<a id='textureatlas'></a>\n#### Using a texture atlas\n\nIf you\u2019re working on a big, complex game, you\u2019ll want a fast and\nefficient way to work with images. A texture atlas can help you do\nthis. A texture atlas is actually two separate files that are closely\nrelated:\n\n- A single PNG **tileset** image file that contains all the images you\n  want to use in your game. (A tileset image is sometimes called a\n  spritesheet.)\n-\tA JSON file that describes the size and position of those sub-images\n  in the tileset.\n\nUsing a texture atlas is a big time saver. You can arrange the\ntileset\u2019s sub-images in any order and the JSON file will keep\ntrack of their sizes and positions for you. This is really convenient\nbecause it means the sizes and positions of the sub-images aren\u2019t\nhard-coded into your game program. If you make changes to the tileset,\nlike adding images, resizing them, or removing them, just re-publish\nthe JSON file and your game will use that updated data to display the\nimages correctly. If you\u2019re going to be making anything bigger than a\nvery small game, you\u2019ll definitely want to use a texture atlas.\n\nThe de-facto standard for tileset JSON data is the format that is\noutput by a popular software tool called [Texture Packer](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker) (Texture Packer's \"Essential\" license is free ). Even if you\ndon\u2019t use Texture Packer, similar tools like [Shoebox](http://renderhjs.net/shoebox/) output JSON files in the same format. Let\u2019s find out how to use it to make a texture\natlas with Texture Packer, and how to load it into a game.\n\n<a id='preparingimages'></a>\n##### Preparing the images\n\nYou first need individual PNG images for each image in your game.\nYou've already got them for Treasure Hunter, so you're all set. Open Texture\nPacker and choose the **{JS}** configuration option. Drag your game images\ninto its workspace. You can also point Texture Packer to any folder that contains\nyour images. Texture Packer will automatically arrange the images on a\nsingle tileset image, and give them names that match their original\nimage file names. It will give them a 2 pixel padding by default.\n\n![Texture Packer](/tutorials/screenshots/12.png)\n\nEach of the sub-images in the atlas is called a **frame**. Although\nit's just one big image, the texture atlas has 5 frames. The name of each\nframe is the same its original PNG file name: \"dungeon.png\",\n\"blob.png\", \"explorer.png\", \"treasure.png\" and \"door.png\". These\nframes names are used to help the atlas reference each sub-image.\n\nWhen you\u2019re done, make sure the Data Format is set to JSON (Hash) and\nclick the Publish button. Choose the file name and location, and save the\npublished files. You\u2019ll end up with a PNG file and a JSON file. In\nthis example my file names are `treasureHunter.json` and\n`treasureHunter.png`. To make\nyour life easier, just keep both files in your project\u2019s `images`\nfolder. (Think of the JSON file as extra metadata for the image file.)\n\nTexture Packer can often be a pain to use, because you need to get all\nthese settings just right for it to publish properly without telling\nyou there are errors. And, it will try to trick you into upgrading to\nthe paid version by using default settings not supported by the free\nversion. So you need to explicitly turn these off (as I've described\nabove) for it to work without errors. Still, it's worth the effort in\nthe end - so keep trying and post an issue in this repository if you\nget impossibly stuck!\n\n<a id='loadingatlas'></a>\n##### loading the texture atlas\n\nTo load the texture atlas into your game, just include the JSON file\nin Hexi's assets array when you initialize the game.\n```js\nlet thingsToLoad = [\n  \"images/treasureHunter.json\",\n  \"sounds/chimes.wav\"\n];\nlet g = hexi(512, 512, setup, thingsToLoad);\ng.scaleToWindow();\ng.start();\n```\nThat's all! You don't have to load the PNG file - Hexi does that\nautomatically in the background. The JSON file is all you need to tell\nHexi which tileset frame (sub-image) to display.\n\nNow if you want to use a frame from the texture atlas to make a\nsprite, you can do it like this:\n```js\nanySprite = g.sprite(\"frameName.png\");\n```\nGa will create the sprite and display the correct image from the\ntexture atlas's tileset.\n\nHere's how to you could create the sprites in Treasure Hunter using\ntexture atlas frames:\n```js\n//The dungeon background\ndungeon = g.sprite(\"dungeon.png\");\n\n//The exit door\nexit = g.sprite(\"door.png\");\nexit.x = 32;\n\n//The player sprite\nplayer = g.sprite(\"explorer.png\");\nplayer.x = 68;\nplayer.y = g.canvas.height / 2 - player.halfWidth;\n\n//Create the treasure\ntreasure = g.sprite(\"treasure.png\");\n```\nHexi knows that those are texture atlas frame names, not individual\nimages, and it displays them directly from the tileset.\n\nIf you ever need to access the texture atlas's JSON file in your game,\nyou can get it like this:\n```js\njsonFile = g.json(\"jsonFileName.json\");\n```\nTake a look at `treasureHunterAtlas.js` file in the `tutorials` folder\nto see a working example of how to load a texture atlas and use it to\nmake sprites.\n\n<a id='alienarmada'></a>\n### Alien Armada\n\nThe next example game in this series of tutorials is Alien Armada. Can you\ndestroy 60 aliens before one of them lands and destroys the Earth? Click the\nimage link below to play the game:\n\n[![Alien Armada](/tutorials/screenshots/13.png)](https://gitcdn.xyz/repo/kittykatattack/hexi/master/tutorials/04_alienArmada.html)\n\nUse the arrow keys to move and press the space bar to shoot. The\naliens descend from the top of the screen with\nincreasing frequency as the game progresses. Here's how the game is played:\n\n![Alien Armada gameplay](/tutorials/screenshots/14.png)\n\nAlien Armada illustrates some new techniques that you'll definitely want\nto use in your games:\n\n- Load and use custom fonts.\n- Display a loading progress bar while the game assets load.\n- Shoot bullets.\n- Create sprites with multiple image states.\n- Generate random enemies.\n- Remove sprites from a game.\n- Display a game score.\n- Reset and restart a game.\n\nYou'll find the fully commented Alien Armada source code in the\n`tutorials` folder. Make sure to take a look at it so that you can see\nall of this code in its proper context. Its general structure is identical\nto Treasure Hunter, with the addition of these new techniques. Let's\nfind out how they were implemented.\n\n<a id='customfonts'></a>\n#### Load and use a custom font\n\nAlien Armada uses a custom font called `emulogic.ttf` to display the\nscore at the top right corner of the screen. The font file is\npreloaded with the rest of the asset files (sounds and images) in the assets array that\ninitializes the game. \n```js\nlet thingsToLoad = [\n  \"images/alienArmada.json\",\n  \"sounds/explosion.mp3\",\n  \"sounds/music.mp3\",\n  \"sounds/shoot.mp3\",\n  \"fonts/emulogic.ttf\" //<- The custom font\n];\nlet g = hexi(480, 320, setup, thingsToLoad, load);\ng.scaleToWindow();\ng.start();\n```\nTo use the font, create a `text` sprite in the game's `setup`\nfunction. The `text` method's second argument is a\nstring that describes the font's point size and name: \"20px emulogic\".  \n```js\nscoreDisplay = g.text(\"0\", \"20px emulogic\", \"#00FF00\", 400, 10);\n```\nYou can and load and use any fonts in TTF, OTF, TTC or WOFF format.\n\n<a id='progressbar'></a>\n#### A loading progress bar\n\nAlien Armada loads three MP3 sound files: a shooting sound, an\nexplosion sound, and music. The music sound is about 2 MB in size so\non a slow network connection this sound could take a few seconds to\nload. While this is happening players would just see the blank canvas while Alien Armada\nloads. Some players might think the game has frozen, so the game\nhelpfully implements a loading bar to inform\nplayers that the assets are loading. It's a blue rectangle that expands from left to right, and\ndisplays a number that tells you the percentage of game assets\nloaded so far.\n\n![Loading progress bar](/tutorials/screenshots/16.png)\n\nThis is a feature that's built into the Hexi engine. \nHexi has a optional loading state that runs while game assets are being\nloaded. You can decide what you want to have happen during the loading\nstate. All you need to do is write a function with code that should\nrun while the assets are loading, and tell Hexi what the name of that\nfunction is. Hexi's engine will automatically run that function in a\nloop until the assets have finished loading.\n\nLet's find out how this works in Alien Armada. The game code tells \nHexi to use a function called `load` during the loading state. It does\nthis by listing `load` as the final argument\nin Hexi's initialization constructor. (Look for `load` in the code below):\n```js\nlet g = hexi(480, 320, setup, thingsToLoad, load); //<- It's here!\n```\nThis tells Hexi to run the `load` function in a loop while the assets\nare loading. \n\nHere's the `load` function from Alien Armada. It implements a\n`loadingBar` object, which is what displays the expanding blue bar and\nthe percentage of files loaded.\n```js\nfunction load(){\n  g.loadingBar();\n}\n\n```\nAfter the assets have loaded, the `setup` state runs automatically. \n\nYou'll find the `loadingBar` code in Hexi's the `core.js` file. It's\nmeant to be a very simple example that you can use as the basis for\nwriting your own custom loading animation, if you want to. You can run any code you\nlike in the `load` function, so it's entirely up to you to decide what\nshould happen or what is displayed while your game is loading.\n\n<a id='shootingbullets'></a>\n#### Shooting bullets\n\nHow can you make the cannon fire bullets? \n\nWhen you press the space bar, the cannon fires bullets at the enemies.\nThe bullets start from the end of the cannon's turret, and travel up the\ncanvas at 7 pixels per frame. If they hit an alien, the alien\nexplodes. If a bullet misses and flies past the top of the stage, the\ngame code removes it.\n\n![Firing bullets](/tutorials/screenshots/17.png)\n\nTo implement a bullet-firing system in your game, the first thing you\nneed is an array to store the all the bullet sprites.\n```js\nbullets = [];\n```\nThis `bullets` array is initialized in the game's `setup` function.\n\nYou can then use Hexi's custom `shoot` method to make any sprite fire\nbullets in any direction. Here's the general format you can use to\nimplement the `shoot` method.\n```js\ng.shoot(\n  cannon,            //The shooter\n  4.71,              //The angle at which to shoot (4.71 is up)\n  cannon.halfWidth,  //Bullet's x position on the cannon\n  0,                 //Bullet's y position on the canon\n  g.stage,           //The container to which the bullet should be added\n  7,                 //The bullet's speed (pixels per frame)\n  bullets,           //The array used to store the bullets\n\n  //A function that returns the sprite that should\n  //be used to make each bullet\n  () => g.sprite(\"bullet.png\")\n);\n```\nThe second argument determines the angle, in radians, at which the\nbullet should travel. 4.71 radians, used in this example, is up. 0 is\nto the right, 1.57 is down, and 3.14 is to the left. \n\nThe 3rd and 4th arguments are the bullet's start x and y position on\nthe canon. The 5th argument is the container that the bullet should be\nadded to, and the 6th is the array that the bullets should be put\ninto.\n\nThe last argument is a function that returns a sprite that should be\nused as the bullet. In this example the bullet is created using using the \n\"bullet.png\" frame from the game's loaded texture atlas.\n```js\n() => g.sprite(\"bullet.png\")\n```\nReplace this function with your own to create any kind of custom\nbullet you might need.\n\nWhen will your bullets be fired? You can call the `shoot` method\nwhenever you want to make bullets, at any point in your code. In Alien\nArmada, bullets are fired when the player presses the space bar. So\nthe game implements this by calling `shoot` inside the space bar's\n`press` method. Here's how:\n```js\ng.spaceBar.press = () => {\n\n  //Shoot the bullet\n  g.shoot(\n    cannon,            //The shooter\n    4.71,              //The angle at which to shoot (4.71 is up)\n    cannon.halfWidth,  //Bullet's x position on the cannon\n    0,                 //Bullet's y position on the canon\n    g.stage,           //The container to which the bullet should be added\n    7,                 //The bullet's speed (pixels per frame)\n    bullets,           //The array used to store the bullets\n\n    //A function that returns the sprite that should\n    //be used to make each bullet\n    () => g.sprite(\"bullet.png\")\n  );\n\n  //Play the shoot sound.\n  shootSound.play();\n};\n```\nYou can see that the `press` method also makes the `shootSound` play.\n(The code above is initialized in the game's `setup` function.)\n\nThere's one more thing you need to do: you have to make the bullets move.\nYou can do this with some code inside the game's looping `play` function. Use Hexi's\n`move` method and supply the `bullets` array as an argument:\n```js\ng.move(bullets);\n```\nThe `move` method automatically loops through all the sprites in the\narray and updates their x and y positions with the value of their `vx` and `vy` velocity values.\n\nSo now you know how the bullets are created and animated. But what happens when\nthey hit one of the aliens?\n\n<a id='spritestates'></a>\n#### Sprite states\n\nWhen a bullet hits an alien, a yellow explosion image appears. This\nsimple effect is created by giving each alien sprite two states: a `normal`\nstate and a `destroyed` state. Aliens are created with their states\nset to `normal`. If they're hit, their states change to `destroyed`.\n\n![The sprite's states](/tutorials/screenshots/18.png)\n\nHow does this system work?\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the Alien Armada tileset, shown here:\n\n![The Alien Armada tileset](/tutorials/screenshots/19.png)\n\nYou can see two image frames that define these two states: `alien.png`\nand `explosion.png`. Before you create the sprite, first create an\narray that lists these two frames: \n```js\nlet alienFrames = [\n  \"alien.png\", \n  \"explosion.png\"\n];\n```\nNext use the `alienFrames` array to initialize the `alien` sprite.\n```js\nalien = g.sprite(alienFrames);\n```\nIf you prefer, you could combine these two steps into one, like this:\n```js\nalien = g.sprite([\n  \"alien.png\", \n  \"explosion.png\"\n]);\n```\nThis loads the sprite up with two frames. Frame `0` is the `alien.png`\nframe, and frame `1` is the `explosion.png` frame. Frame `0` is\ndisplayed by default by when the sprite is first created. \n\nYou can use the sprite's `show` method to display any other frame number on the\nsprite, like this:\n```js\nalien.show(1);\n```\nThe code above will set the alien to frame number one, which is the\n`explosion.png` frame.\n\nTo make your code a little more readable, its a good idea to define\nyour sprite's states in a special `states` object. Give each state a\nname, with a value that corresponds to that state's frame number.\nHere's how you could define two states on the alien: `normal` and\n`destroyed`:\n```js\nalien.states = {\n  normal: 0,\n  destroyed: 1\n};\n```\n`alien.states.normal` now has the value `0`, and\n`alien.states.destroyed` now has the value `1`. That means you could\ndisplay the alien's `normal` state like this:\n```js\nalien.show(alien.states.normal);\n```\nAnd display the alien's `destroyed` state like this:\n```js\nalien.show(alien.states.destroyed);\n```\nThis makes your code a little more readable because you can tell at a\nglance which sprite state is being displayed.\n\n(Note: Hexi also has a lower-level `gotoAndStop` method that does\nexactly the same thing as `show`. Although you're free use `gotoAndStop` in your\ngame code, by convention it's only used internally by Hexi's rendering\nengine.)\n\n<a id='randomaliens'></a>\n#### Generating random aliens\n\nAlien Armada generates aliens at any 1 of 14 randomly chosen positions\njust above the top boundary of the stage. The aliens first appear\ninfrequently, but gradually start to appear at an ever-increasing rate. This makes the game gradually more difficult as it progresses. Let's find out how these two features are implemented.\n\n<a id='timingaliens'></a>\n##### Timing the aliens\n\nWhen the game starts, the first new alien is generated after 100\nframes have elapsed. A variable called `alienFrequency`, initialized in\nthe game's `setup` function is used to help track this. it's\ninitialized to 100.\n```js\nalienFrequency = 100;\n```\nAnother variable called `alienTimer` is used to count the number of\nof frames that have elapsed between the previously generated alien,\nand the next one. \n```js\nalienTimer = 0;\n```\n`alienTimer` is updated by 1 each frame in the `play` function (the game loop).\nWhen `alienTimer` reaches the value of `alienFrequency`, a new alien\nsprite is generated. Here's the code from the `play` function that\ndoes this. (This code omits the actual code that generates the alien\nsprite - we'll look at that ahead)\n```js\n//Add one to the alienTimer\nalienTimer++;\n\n//Make a new alien if `alienTimer` equals the `alienFrequency`\nif(alienTimer === alienFrequency) {\n\n  //... Create the alien: see ahead for the missing code that does this...\n\n  //Set the `alienTimer` back to zero\n  alienTimer = 0;\n\n  //Reduce `alienFrequency` by one to gradually increase\n  //the frequency that aliens are created\n  if(alienFrequency > 2){  \n    alienFrequency--;\n  }\n}\n```\nYou can see in the code above that `alienFrequency` is reduced by 1\nafter the sprite has been created. That will make the next alien appear 1 frame earlier than the\nprevious alien, and which is why the rate of falling aliens slowly\nincreases. You can also see that the `alienTimer` is set back to 0 after the sprite\nhas been created so that it can restart counting towards making\nthe next new alien. \n\n<a id='randomposition'></a>\n##### The aliens' random start positions\n\nBefore we generate any aliens, we need an array to store all the alien\nsprites. An empty array called `aliens` is initialized in the `setup`\nfunction for this purpose.\n```js\naliens = [];\n```\nEach alien is then created in the `play` function, inside the same\n`if` statement we looked at above. This code has a lot of work to do:\n\n- It sets the alien's image frames and states. \n- Its sets the alien's velocity (`vx` and `vy`.) \n- It positions the alien at a random horizontal position above the top stage boundary.\n- And, finally, it pushes the alien into the `aliens` array. \n\nHere's the full code that does all this:\n```js\n//Add one to the alienTimer\nalienTimer++;\n\n//Make a new alien if `alienTimer` equals the `alienFrequency`\nif(alienTimer === alienFrequency) {\n\n  //Create the alien.\n  //Assign two frames from the texture atlas as the \n  //alien's two states\n  let alienFrames = [\n    \"alien.png\", \n    \"explosion.png\"\n  ];\n\n  //Initialize the alien sprite with the frames\n  let alien = g.sprite(alienFrames);\n\n  //Define some states on the alien that correspond\n  //to its two frames.\n  alien.states = {\n    normal: 0,\n    destroyed: 1\n  };\n  \n  //Set its y position above the screen boundary\n  alien.y = 0 - alien.height;\n  \n  //Assign the alien a random x position\n  alien.x = g.randomInt(0, 14) * alien.width;\n  \n  //Set its speed\n  alien.vy = 1;\n  \n  //Push the alien into the `aliens` array\n  aliens.push(alien);\n\n  //Set the `alienTimer` back to zero\n  alienTimer = 0;\n\n  //Reduce `alienFrequency` by one to gradually increase\n  //the frequency that aliens are created\n  if(alienFrequency > 2){  \n    alienFrequency--;\n  }\n}\n```\nYou can see in the code above that the alien's `y` position places it\nout of sight just above the stage's top boundary.\n```js\nalien.y = 0 - alien.height;\n```\nIt's `x` position, however, is random. \n```js\nalien.x = g.randomInt(0, 14) * alien.width;\n```\nThis code places it in one of 15 possible random positions (0 to 14) above the\ntop of the stage. Here's an illustration of these positions:\n\n![The Alien Armada tileset](/tutorials/screenshots/20.png)\n\nFinally, and very importantly, the code pushes the alien sprite into\nthe `aliens` array.\n```js\naliens.push(alien);\n```\nAll this code starts pumping out aliens at a steadily increasing rate.\n\n<a id='movingaliens'></a>\n#### Moving the aliens\n\nHow do we make the aliens move? In exactly the same way made the\nbullets move. You'll notice in the code above that\neach alien is initialized with a `vy` (vertical velocity) value of 1.\n```js\nalien.vy = 1;\n```\nWhen this value is applied to the alien's `y` position, it will make the alien move down, towards the bottom of the stage,\nat the rate of 1 pixel per frame. All the alien sprites in the game are in\nthe `aliens` array. So to make all of them move you need to loop\nthrough each sprite in the `aliens` array each frame and add their\n`vy` values to their `y` positions. Some code like this in the `play`\nfunction would work:\n```js\naliens.forEach(alien => {\n  alien.y += alien.vy;\n});\n```\nHowever, its easier just to use Hexi's convenient built-in `move` function. Just\nsupply `move` with the array of sprites that you want to move, like\nthis:\n```js\ng.move(aliens);\n```\nThis updates the aliens positions with their velocities automatically.\n\n<a id='explodealiens'></a>\n#### Making the aliens explode\n\nNow that you know how to change the alien's state, how can you use\nthis skill to create the explosion effect? Here's the simplified code\nfrom Alien Armada that shows you how to do this. Use `hitTestRectangle` to\ncheck for a collision between an alien and bullet. If a collision is detected,\nremove the bullet, show the alien's `destroyed` state, and then remove\nthe alien after a delay of one second.\n```js\nif (g.hitTestRectangle(alien, bullet)) {\n\n  //Remove the bullet sprite.\n  g.remove(bullet);\n\n  //Show the alien's `destroyed` state.\n  alien.show(alien.states.destroyed);\n\n  //Wait for 1 second (1000 milliseconds) then \n  //remove the alien sprite.\n  g.wait(1000, () => g.remove(alien));\n}\n```\nYou can use Hexi's universal `remove` function to remove any sprite from a game, like this:\n```js\ng.remove(anySprite);\n```\nYou can optionally use it to remove more than one sprite at a time by\nlisting the sprites to remove in the arguments, like this:\n```js\ng.remove(spriteOne, spriteTwo, spriteThree);\n```\nYou can even use it to remove all the sprites in an array of sprites. Just\nsupply the sprite array as `remove`'s only argument:\n```js\ng.remove(arrayOfSprites);\n```\nThis will both make the sprites disappear from the screen, and also\nempty them out of the array that they were in.\n\nHexi also has a convenient method called `wait` that will run a function\nafter any delay (in milliseconds) that you specify. The Alien Armada\ngame code uses `wait` to remove the alien after a one second delay,\nlike this:\n```js\ng.wait(1000, () => g.remove(alien));\n```\nThis allows the alien to display its `explosion` image state for one\nsecond before it disappears from the game.\n\nThese are the basic techniques involved in making the aliens explode\nand removing the aliens and bullets from the game when they collide.\nBut the actual code used in Alien Armada is a little more complex. That's\nbecause the code uses nested `filter` loops to loop through all the bullets\nand aliens so that they can be checked against each other for\ncollisions. The code also plays an explosion sound when a collision\noccurs, and updates the score by 1. Here's all the code from the\ngame's `play` function that does this. (If you're new to JavaScript's\n`filter` loops, you can [read about how to use them here.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter))\n```js\n//Check for a collision between the aliens and the bullets.\n//Filter through each alien in the `aliens` array.\naliens = aliens.filter(alien => {\n\n  //A variable to help check if the alien is\n  //alive or dead.\n  let alienIsAlive = true;\n\n  //Filter though all the bullets.\n  bullets = bullets.filter(bullet => {\n\n    //Check for a collision between an alien and bullet.\n    if (g.hitTestRectangle(alien, bullet)) {\n\n      //Remove the bullet sprite.\n      g.remove(bullet);\n\n      //Show the alien's `destroyed` state.\n      alien.show(alien.states.destroyed);\n\n      //You could alternatively use the frame number,\n      //like this:\n      //alien.show(1);\n\n      //Play the explosion sound.\n      explosionSound.play();\n\n      //Stop the alien from moving.\n      alien.vy = 0;\n\n      //Set `alienAlive` to false so that it can be\n      //removed from the array.\n      alienIsAlive = false;\n\n      //Wait for 1 second (1000 milliseconds) then \n      //remove the alien sprite.\n      g.wait(1000, () => g.remove(alien));\n\n      //Update the score.\n      score += 1;\n\n      //Remove the bullet from the `bullets array.\n      return false;\n\n    } else {\n\n      //If there's no collision, keep the bullet in the\n      //bullets array.\n      return true;\n    }\n  });\n\n  //Return the value of `alienIsAlive` back to the \n  //filter loop. If it's `true`, the alien will be\n  //kept in the `aliens` array. \n  //If it's `false` it will be removed from the `aliens` array.\n  return alienIsAlive;\n});\n```\nAs long as the filter loops return `true`, the current sprite being\nchecked will remain in the array. If there's a collision, however, the\nloops return `false` and the current alien and bullet will be removed\nfrom their arrays. \n\nAnd that's how the game's collision works!\n\n<a id='displayingscore'></a>\n#### Displaying the score\n\nAnother new feature introduced by Alien Armada is a dynamic score\ndisplay. Each time an alien is hit, the score at the top right corner\nof the game screen increases by one. How does this work?\n\nAlien Armada initializes a `text` sprite called `scoreDisplay` in the\ngame's `setup` function.\n```js\nscoreDisplay = g.text(\"0\", \"20px emulogic\", \"#00FF00\", 400, 10);\n```\nYou saw in the previous section\nthat 1 is added to the game's `score` variable each time an alien is\nhit:\n```js\nscore += 1;\n```\nTo visibly update the score, all you need to do is set the `score`\nvalue as the `scoreDisplay`'s `content`, like this:\n```js\nscoreDisplay.content = score;\n```\nAnd that's all there is to it!\n\n<a id='endinggame2'></a>\n#### Ending and resetting the game\n\nThere are two ways the game can end. Either the player shoots down 60\naliens, in which case the player wins. Or, one of the aliens has to travel\nbeyond the bottom edge of the stage, in which case the aliens win. \n\nA simple if statement in the `play` function checks for this. If\neither condition becomes `true`, the `winner` is set to either\n\"player\" or \"aliens\" and the game's `state` is changed to `end`.\n```js\n//The player wins if the score matches the value\n//of `scoreNeededToWin`, which is 60\nif (score === scoreNeededToWin) {\n\n  //Set the player as the winner.\n  winner = \"player\";\n\n  //Change the game's state to `end`.\n  g.state = end;\n}\n\n//The aliens win if one of them reaches the bottom of\n//the stage.\naliens.forEach(alien => {\n\n  //Check to see if the `alien`'s `y` position is greater\n  //than the `stage`'s `height`\n  if (alien.y > g.stage.height) { \n\n    //Set the aliens as the winner.\n    winner = \"aliens\";\n\n    //Change the game's state to `end`.\n    g.state = end;\n  }\n});\n```\nThe `end` function pauses the game, so that the animation freezes. It\nthen displays the `gameOverMessage`, which will either be \"Earth\nSaved!\" or \"Earth Destroyed!\", depending on the outcome. As an extra\ntouch, the music `volume` is also set to 50%. Then after a\ndelay of 3 seconds, a function named `reset` is called. Here's the\ncomplete `end` function that does all this:\n```js\nfunction end() {\n\n  //Pause the game loop.\n  g.pause();\n  \n  //Create the game over message text.\n  gameOverMessage = g.text(\"\", \"20px emulogic\", \"#00FF00\", 90, 120);\n\n  //Reduce the music volume by half.\n  //1 is full volume, 0 is no volume, and 0.5 is half volume.\n  music.volume = 0.5;\n\n  //Display \"Earth Saved!\" if the player wins.\n  if (winner === \"player\") {\n    gameOverMessage.content = \"Earth Saved!\";\n    gameOverMessage.x = 120;\n  }\n\n  //Display \"Earth Destroyed!\" if the aliens win.\n  if (winner === \"aliens\") {\n    gameOverMessage.content = \"Earth Destroyed!\";  \n  }\n\n  //Wait for 3 seconds then run the `reset` function.\n  g.wait(3000, () => reset());\n}\n```\nThe `reset` function resets all of the game variables back to their\nstarting values. It also turns the music volume back up to 1. It uses\nthe `remove` function to remove any remaining sprites from the\n`aliens` and `bullets` arrays, so that those arrays can be\nre-populated when the game starts again. `remove` is also used to\nremove the `gameOverMessage`, and the `cannon` sprite is re-centered\nat the bottom of the stage. Finally, the game `state` is set back to\n`play`, and the game loop is un-paused by calling Hexi's `resume`\nmethod.\n```js\nfunction reset() {\n\n  //Reset the game variables.\n  score = 0;\n  alienFrequency = 100;\n  alienTimer = 0;\n  winner = \"\";\n\n  //Set the music back to full volume.\n  music.volume = 1;\n\n  //Remove any remaining alien and bullet sprites.\n  //The universal `remove` method will loop through\n  //all the sprites in an array of sprites, removed them\n  //from their parent container, and splice them out of the array.\n  g.remove(aliens);\n  g.remove(bullets);\n\n  //You can also use the universal `remove` function to remove.\n  //a single sprite.\n  g.remove(gameOverMessage);\n\n  //Re-center the cannon.\n  g.stage.putBottom(cannon, 0, -40);\n\n  //Change the game state back to `play`.\n  g.state = play;\n  g.resume();\n}\n```\nAnd this is all the code needed to start the game again. You can play\nAlien Armada as many times as you like and it will reset and restart\nitself like this endlessly.\n\n<a id='flappyfairy'></a>\n### Flappy Fairy!\n\nFlappy Fairy is a homage to one of the most infamous games ever made: [Flappy\nBird](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird). Click the\nimage link below to play the game:\n\n[![FlappyFairy](/tutorials/screenshots/21.png)](https://gitcdn.xyz/repo/kittykatattack/hexi/master/tutorials/04_flappyFairy.html)\n\nClick the \"Go\" button, and game will launch in full screen mode. Tap\nanywhere on the screen to make the fairy fly, and help her navigate\nthrough the gaps in 15 pillars to reach the finish. A trail of multicolored \nfairy dust follows the fairy as she flies through the maze. \nIf she hits one of the green blocks she explodes in a shower of dust. \nBut if she manages to navigate through the increasingly narrowing gaps between \nall 15 pillars, she reaches a big floating \u201cFinish\u201d sign. \n\n![Flappy Fairy gameplay](/tutorials/screenshots/22.png)\n\nIf you can make a game like Flappy Fairy, you can make almost any\nother kind of 2D action game. In addition to using the all techniques you've\nalready learnt, Flappy Fairy introduces some exciting new ones:\n\n- Launching a game in full screen mode.\n- Make a click-able button. \n- Create an animated sprite.\n- Use a `tilingSprite` to make a scrolling background.\n- Use particle effects.\n\nYou'll find the fully commented Flappy Fairy source code in the\n`tutorials` folder. Make sure to take a look at it so that you can see\nall of this code in its proper context. Its general structure is identical\nto the other games in this tutorial, with the addition of these new techniques. Let's\nfind out how they were implemented.\n\n<a id='makeabutton'></a>\n#### Make a button\n\nThe game starts when you press the \"Go\" button. The \"Go\" button is a special sprite\ncalled a `button`. `button` sprites have 3 image frame states: up, over and\ndown. You can create a `button` with three states like this:\n```js\ngoButton = g.button([\n  \"up.png\",\n  \"over.png\",\n  \"down.png\"\n]);\n```\n`up.png` is an image that shows what the button should look like when the it's not\ninteracting with the pointer. `over.png` shows what the button looks\nlike when the pointer is over it, and `down.png` is the image that is\ndisplayed when the pointer presses down on the button.\n\n![Button states](/tutorials/screenshots/23.png)\n\n(The `down.png` image is offset slightly down and to the right, so it\nlooks like its being pressed down.) You can assign any images you like\nto these states, and the `button` will display them automatically based on how the pointer is interacting with it. \n\n(Note: If your game is touch-only, you might have only two button states: up and down. In that case, just assign two image frames, and Hexi will assume they refer to the up and down states.)\n\nButtons have special methods that you can define: `press`,\n`release`,`over`, `out` and `tap`. You can assign any code you like to\nthese methods. For example, here's how you could change the game's\nstate when the user releases the `playButton`:\n```js\ngoButton.release = () => {\n  g.state = setupGame;\n};\n```\nButtons also have a Boolean (true/false) property called `enabled`\nthat you\ncan set to `false` if you want to disable the button. (Set `enabled`\nto `true` to re-enable it.) You can also use the button's `state`\nproperty to find out if the button state is currently `\"up\"`, `\"over\"`\nor `\"down\"`. (These state values are strings.)\n\nImportant! You can give **any** sprite the qualities of a button just by\nsetting its `interact` property to `true`, like this:\n```js\nanySprite.interact = true;\n```\nThis will give the sprite `press`, `release`, `over`, `out` and `tap`\nmethods, and the same `state` property as ordinary buttons. This means\nthat you can make any sprite click-able, which is really useful for a\nwide variety of interactive games.\n\nYou can also make the `stage` object interactive, which turns the whole \ngame screen into an interactive button:\n```js\ng.stage.interact = true;\n```\nFor more detail on how to use buttons, see the `buttons.html` file\nin the `examples` folder.\n\n<a id='animatingsprites'></a>\n#### Animating sprites\n\nA neat feature of Flappy Fairy is that the fairy character flaps her wings\nwhen she's flying up. This animation was created by rapidly displaying 3\nsimple images in a continuous loop. Each image displays a slightly different\nframe of the animation, as shown below:\n\n![Animation frames](/tutorials/screenshots/24.png)\n\nThese three images are just three ordinary frames in the game's texture atlas, called\n`0.png`, `1.png` and `2.png`.  But how can you turn a sequence of frames like this into a sprite animation?\n\nFirst, create an array that defines the frames of the animation, like\nthis:\n```js\nlet fairyFrames = [\n  \"0.png\", \n  \"1.png\", \n  \"2.png\"\n];\n```\nThen create a sprite using those frames, like this:\n```js\nlet fairy = g.sprite(fairyFrames);\n```\nOr, if you prefer, you can combine this into one step:\n```js\nlet fairy = g.sprite([\n  \"0.png\", \n  \"1.png\", \n  \"2.png\"\n]);\n\n```\nAny sprite with more than one image frame automatically becomes an\nanimated sprite. If you want the animation frames to start playing,\njust call the sprite's `playAnimation` method:\n```js\nfairy.playAnimation();\n```\nThe frames will automatically play in a continuous loop. If you don't want them\nto loop, set `loop` to `false`.\n```js\nfairy.loop = false;\n```\nUse the `stopAnimation` method to stop an animation:\n```js\nfairy.stopAnimation();\n```\nIf you want to know whether or not a sprite's animation is currently\nplaying, use the Boolean (true/false) `playing` property to find out.\n\nHow quickly or slowly do you want the animation to play? You can set\nthe animation's frames-per-second (`fps`) like this:\n```js\nfairy.fps = 24;\n```\nA sprite animation's frame rate is independent of the game's frame\nrate. That gives you a lot of flexibility to fine-tune sprite\nanimations.\n\nWhat if you don't want to use all the sprite's image frames in the animation, only some of them? For example, imagine that you have a sprite with 30 frames, but you only want to play frames 10 to 15 as part of the animation. Supply the `playAnimation` method with an array containing two numbers: the first and last frames of the sequence you want to play.\n```js\nanimatedSprite.playAnimation([10, 15]);\n```\nNow only the frames between 10 to 15 will play as part of the animation. To make\nthis more readable, you can define the sequence as an array that\ndescribes what those animated frames actually do. For example, perhaps\nthey define a character's walk cycle. You could create an array called\n`walkCycle` that defines those frames:\n```js\nlet walkCycle = [10, 15];\n```\nThen use that array with `playAnimation`, like this:\n```js\nanimatedSprite.playAnimation(walkCycle);\n```\nThat's a bit more code to write, but much more readable!\n\nFor more details on Hexi's sprite animation system and what you can do\nwith it, see the `keyframeAnimation.html`,\n`textureAtlasAnimation.html` and  `animationStates.html` file in the `examples` folder.\n\n<a id='makingthefairyfly'></a>\n#### Making the fairy fly\n\nNow that you know how to animate a sprite, how is Flappy Fairy's\nflying animation triggered when you tap on the game screen?\n\nA value of `0.05`, which represents gravity, is subtracted from the\nfairy's `y` position each frame in the `play` function. This is the\ngravity effect that pulls the fairy to the bottom of the screen. \n```js\nfairy.vy += -0.05;\nfairy.y -= fairy.vy;\n```\nBut when you tap the screen, the fairy flies up. This is thanks to\nHexi's built-in `pointer` object. It has a `tap` method which you can define to\nperform any action you like. In Flappy Fairy, the `tap` method increases the fairy's vertical velocity, `vy`, by 1.5 pixels each time you tap.\n```js\ng.pointer.tap = () => {\n  fairy.vy += 1.5;\n};  \n```\nHexi's built-in `pointer` object also has `press` and `release` methods\nthat you can define in the same way. It also has Boolean (true/false)\n`isUp`, `isDown` and `tapped` properties that you can use to find the\npointer's state, if you need to.\n\nBut you'll notice that the fairy only flaps her wings when she's\nstarting to fly up, and stops flapping when she looses momentum and\nstarts going down. To make this work, you need to know whether the fairy is\ncurrently on the way up, or on the way down, based on a change in the\nfairy's vertical velocity (vy) value. The game implements a well-worn\nold trick to help figure this out. The `play` function captures the\nfairy's velocity for this current frame in a new value called `oldVy`. But\nit does this *only after the fairy's position has changed*. \n```js\nfunction play(){\n\n  //...\n  //... all of the code that moves the fairy comes first...\n  //...\n\n  //Then, after the fairy's position has been changed, capture\n  //her velocity for this current frame\n  fairy.oldVy = fairy.vy;\n}\n```\nThis means that when the next game frame swings around, `oldVy` will still be storing the fairy's velocity value from the *previous frame*. And that means you\ncan use that value to figure out the change in the fairy's velocity from the\nprevious frame to the current frame. If she's starting to go up (if `vy` is\ngreater than `oldVy`), play the fairy's animation: \n```js\nif (fairy.vy > fairy.oldVy) {\n  if(!fairy.playing) {\n    fairy.playAnimation();\n  }\n}\n```\nIf she's starting to go down, stop the animation and just show the\nfairy's first frame.\n```js\nif (fairy.vy < 0 && fairy.oldVy > 0) {\n  if (fairy.playing) fairy.stopAnimation();\n  fairy.show(0);\n}\n```\nAnd that's how the fairy flies!\n\n<a id='makeascrollingbackground'></a>\n#### Make a scrolling background\n\nA fun new feature of Flappy Fairy is that it has an infinitely scrolling\nbackground of clouds moving from right to left.\n\n![Scrolling background](/tutorials/screenshots/25.png)\n\nThe background moves at a slower rate than the green pillars, and that\ncreates the illusion that the clouds are further away. (This is a\nshallow, pseudo 3D effect called **paralax scrolling**.) \n\nThe background is just a single image.\n\n![Scrolling background](/tutorials/screenshots/26.png)\n\nThe image has been designed so that the clouds **tile seamlessly**:\nthe clouds on the top and left match up with the clouds on the right\nand bottom. That means you can connect multiple instances of the same\nimage and they will appear to create a single, unbroken continuous\nimage. ([Image from OpenGameArt.](opengameart.org/content/cartoony-sky)) \n\nBecause this is really useful for games, Hexi has a sprite type\ncalled a `tilingSprite` that's designed just for such infinite\nscrolling effects. Here's how to create a `tilingSprite`: \n```js\nsky = g.tilingSprite(\n  \"sky.png\"              //The image to use\n  g.canvas.width,        //The width\n  g.canvas.height,       //The height\n);\n```\nThe first argument the image your want to use, and the last two\narguments are the sprite's width and height. \n\nTiling sprites have the same properties as normal sprites, with the addition of two new properties: `tileX` and `tileY`. Those two properties let you set the image offset from the sprite's top left corner. If you want to make a tiling sprite scroll continuously, just increase its `tileX` value by some small amount each frame in the game loop, like this:\n```js\nsky.tileX -= 1;\n```\nAnd that's all you need to do to make an infinitely scrolling\nbackground.\n\n<a id='particleeffects'></a>\n#### Particle effects\n\nHow do you create effects like fire, smoke, magic, and explosions? \nYou make lots of tiny sprites; dozens, hundreds or thousands of them. \nThen apply some physical or gravitational constraints to those sprites \nso that they behave like the element you\u2019re trying to simulate. You \nalso need to give them some rules about how they should appear and \ndisappear, and what kinds of patterns they should form. These tiny \nsprites are called particles. You can use them to make a wide range \nof special effects for games.\n\nHexi has a versatile built-in method called `ceateParticles` that can\ncreate most kinds of particle effects you'll need for games. Here's\nthe format for using it:\n```js\ncreateParticles(\n  pointer.x,                           //The particle\u2019s starting x position\n  pointer.y,                           //The particle\u2019s starting y position\n  () => sprite(\"images/star.png\"),     //Particle function\n  g.stage,                             //The container to add the particles to   \n  20,                                  //Number of particles\n  0.1,                                 //Gravity\n  true,                                //Random spacing\n  0, 6.28,                             //Min/max angle\n  12, 24,                              //Min/max size\n  1, 2,                                //Min/max speed\n  0.005, 0.01,                         //Min/max scale speed\n  0.005, 0.01,                         //Min/max alpha speed\n  0.05, 0.1                            //Min/max rotation speed\n);\n```\nYou can see that most of the arguments describe a range between the \nminimum and maximum values that should be used to change the sprites\u2019 \nspeed, rotation, scale, or alpha. You can also assign the number of \nparticles that should be created, and add optional gravity. \nYou can make particles using any sprites by customizing the third argument.\nJust supply a function that returns the kind of sprite you want to use\nfor each particle:\n```js\n() => (\"images/star.png\"),\n```\nIf you supply a sprite that has multiple frames, the `createParticles` \nmethod will automatically choose a random frame for each particle.\nThe minimum and maximum angle values are important for defining the \ncircular spread of particles as they radiate out from the origin point. \nFor a completely circular explosion effect, use a minimum angle of 0 and \na maximum angle of 6.28.\n```js\n0, 6.28,\n```\n(These values are radians; the equivalent in degrees is 0 and 360.) \n0 starts at the 3 o\u2019clock position, pointing directly to the right. 3.14 \nis the 9 o\u2019clock position, and 6.28 takes you around back to 0 again.\nIf you want to constrain the particle range to a narrower angle, just \nsupply the minimum and maximum values that describe that range. Here are \nvalues you could use to constrain the angle to a pizza-slice with the \ncrust pointing left.\n```js\n2.4, 3.6,\n```\nYou could use a constrained angle range like this to create a particle\nstream, like those used to create a fountain or rocket engine flames. \n(You\u2019ll see exactly how to do this ahead.) The random spacing value \n(the sixth argument) determines whether the particles should be spaced \nevenly (`false`) or randomly (`true`) within this range.\nBy carefully choosing the sprite for the particle and finely adjusting \neach parameter, you can use this all-purpose `createParticles` method \nto simulate everything from liquid to fire. In Flappy Fairy, it's used\nto create fairy dust.\n\n<a id='thefairydustexplosions'></a>\n##### The fairy dust explosions\n\nWhen Flappy Fairy hits a block, she disappears in a puff of dust. \n\n![Fairy dust explosion](/tutorials/screenshots/27.png)\n\nHow does that effect work?\n\nBefore we can create the explosion effect, we have to define an array\nthat lists the images we want to use for each particle.\nAs you learned above, the `createParticles` method will randomly \ndisplay a frame on a sprite, if that sprite contains multiple frames. \nTo make this work, first define an array of texture atlas frames that \nyou want to use for the fairy's dust explosion:\n```js\ndustFrames = [\n  \"pink.png\",\n  \"yellow.png\",\n  \"green.png\",\n  \"violet.png\"\n];\n```\nThe explosion happens when the fairy hits one of the green blocks.\nThe game loop does this with the help of the `hitTestRectangle` \nmethod. The code loops through the `blocks.children` array and tests for \na collision between each green block and the fairy. If `hitTestRectangle` \nreturns `true`, the loop quits and a collision object called\n`fairyVsBlock` becomes `true`.\n```js\nlet fairyVsBlock = blocks.children.some(block => {\n  return g.hitTestRectangle(fairy, block, true);  \n});\n```\n`hitTestRectangle`\u2019s third argument needs to be `true` so that the collision \ndetection is done using the sprite\u2019s global coordinates (`gx` and `gy`). \nThat\u2019s because the fairy is a child of the `stage`, but each block is a child \nof the `blocks` group. That means they don\u2019t share the same local coordinate space. \nUsing the blocks sprites' global coordinates forces `hitTestRectangle`\nto use their positions relative to the canvas. \n\nIf `fairyVsBlock` is `true`, and the fairy is currently visible, the \ncollision code runs. It makes the fairy invisible, creates the particle \nexplosion, and calls the game\u2019s `reset` function after a delay of 3 seconds.\n```js\nif (fairyVsBlock && fairy.visible) {\n\n  //Make the fairy invisible\n  fairy.visible = false;\n\n  //Create a fairy dust explosion\n  g.createParticles(\n    fairy.centerX, fairy.centerY, //x and y position\n    () => g.sprite(dustFrames),   //Particle sprite\n    g.stage,                      //The container to add the particles to  \n    20,                           //Number of particles\n    0,                            //Gravity\n    false,                        //Random spacing\n    0, 6.28,                      //Min/max angle\n    16, 32,                       //Min/max size\n    1, 3                          //Min/max speed\n  );\n  \n  //Stop the dust emitter that's trailing the fairy\n  dust.stop();\n\n  //Wait 3 seconds and then reset the game\n  g.wait(3000, reset);\n}\n```\n\n<a id='useaparticleemitter'></a>\n##### Use a particle emitter\n\nA particle emitter is just a simple timer that creates particles at \nfixed intervals. That means instead of just calling the \n`createParticles` method once, the emitter calls it periodically.\nHexi has a built-in `particleEmitter` method that let's you do this easily.\nHere\u2019s how to use it:\n```js\nlet particleStream = g.particleEmitter(\n  100,                                      //The interval\n  () => g.createParticles(                  //The `particleEffect` function\n    //Assign particle parameters...\n  )\n);\n```\nThe `particleEmitter` method just wraps around the `createParticles` method. \nIts first argument is a number, in milliseconds, that determines how \nfrequently the particles should be created. The second argument is \nthe `createParticles` method, which you can customize however you like. \nThe `particleEmitter` method returns an object with `play` and `stop` methods \nthat you can use to control the particle stream. You can use them \njust like the `play` and `stop` methods you use to control a sprite\u2019s \nanimation.\n```js\nparticleStream.play();\nparticleStream.stop();\n```\nThe emitter object also has a `playing` property that will be either \n`true` or `false` depending on the emitter\u2019s current state. (See the\n`particleEmitter.html` file in the `examples` folder for more details\non how to create and use a particle emitter.)\n\nA particle emitter is used in Flappy Fairy to make the fairy emit a \nstream of multicolored particles while she\u2019s flapping her wings. The \nparticles are constrained to an angle between 2.4 and 3.6 radians, so \nthey\u2019re emitted in a cone-shaped wedge to the left of the fairy. \n\n![Emitting fairy dust](/tutorials/screenshots/28.png)\n\nThe particle stream randomly emits pink, yellow, green, or violet \nparticles, each of which is a separate frame on the texture atlas.\n\nHere's the code that creates this effect: \n```js\ndustFrames = [\n  \"pink.png\",\n  \"yellow.png\",\n  \"green.png\",\n  \"violet.png\"\n];\n\n//Create the emitter\ndust = g.particleEmitter(\n  300,                                   //The interval\n  () => {                         \n      g.createParticles(                 //The function\n      fairy.x + 8,                       //x position\n      fairy.y + fairy.halfHeight + 8,    //y position\n      () => g.sprite(dustFrames),        //Particle sprite\n      g.stage,                           //The container to add the particles to               \n      3,                                 //Number of particles\n      0,                                 //Gravity\n      true,                              //Random spacing\n      2.4, 3.6,                          //Min/max angle\n      12, 18,                            //Min/max size\n      1, 2,                              //Min/max speed\n      0.005, 0.01,                       //Min/max scale speed\n      0.005, 0.01,                       //Min/max alpha speed\n      0.05, 0.1                          //Min/max rotation speed\n    );\n  }\n);\n```\nYou can now control the `dust` emitter with `play` and `stop` methods.\n\n<a id='creatingandmovingthepillars'></a>\n#### Creating and moving the pillars\n\nYou now know how Flappy Fairy implements some of Hexi's special features\nfor some fun and useful effects. But, if you're new to game\nprogramming, you might also be wondering how the world that Flappy Fairy flies\nthrough was created. Let's take a quick look at the code that creates\nand moves the green pillars that the fairy has to navigate to reach\nthe Finish sign.\n\nThere are fifteen green pillars in the game. Every five pillars, the \ngap between the top and bottom sections becomes narrower. The first five \npillars have a gap of four blocks, the next five have a gap of three blocks \nand the last five have a gap of two blocks. This makes the game increasingly \ndifficult as Flappy Fairy flies further. The exact position of the gap is \nrandom for each pillar, and different every time game is played. Each pillar \nis spaced by 384 pixels, and here's how they would look like if \nthey were right next to each other.\n\n![The green pillars](/tutorials/screenshots/29.png)\n\nYou can see how the gap gradually narrows from four spaces on the left \ndown to two on the right. \n\nAll the blocks that make up the pillars are in a `group` called\n`blocks`.\n```js\nblocks = g.group();\n```\nA nested for loop creates each block and adds it to the `blocks` container. \nThe outer loop runs 15 times; once to create each pillar. The inner loop \nruns eight times; once for each block in the pillar. The blocks are only \nadded if they\u2019re not occupying the range that\u2019s been randomly chosen for \nthe gap. Every fifth time the outer loop runs, the size of the gap narrows by one.\n```js\n//What should the initial size of the gap be between the pillars?\nlet gapSize = 4;\n\n//How many pillars?\nlet numberOfPillars = 15;\n\n//Loop 15 times to make 15 pillars\nfor (let i = 0; i < numberOfPillars; i++) {\n\n  //Randomly place the gap somewhere inside the pillar\n  let startGapNumber = g.randomInt(0, 8 - gapSize); \n\n  //Reduce the `gapSize` by one after every fifth pillar. This is\n  //what makes gaps gradually become narrower\n  if (i > 0 && i % 5 === 0) gapSize -= 1; \n\n  //Create a block if it's not within the range of numbers\n  //occupied by the gap\n  for (let j = 0; j < 8; j++) {\n    if (j < startGapNumber || j > startGapNumber + gapSize - 1) {\n      let block = g.sprite(\"greenBlock.png\");\n      blocks.addChild(block);\n\n      //Space each pillar 384 pixels apart. The first pillar will be\n      //placed at an x position of 512\n      block.x = (i * 384) + 512;\n      block.y = j * 64;\n    }\n  }\n\n  //After the pillars have been created, add the finish image\n  //right at the end\n  if (i === numberOfPillars - 1) {\n    finish = g.sprite(\"finish.png\");\n    blocks.addChild(finish);\n    finish.x = (i * 384) + 896;\n    finish.y = 192;\n  }\n}\n```\nThe last part of the code adds the big `finish` sprite to the world, which \nFlappy Fairy will see if she manages to make it through to the end.\n\nThe game loop moves the group of blocks by 2 pixels to the right each \nframe, but only while the finish sprite is off-screen:\n```js\nif (finish.gx > 256) {\n  blocks.x -= 2;\n}\n```\nWhen the `finish` sprite scrolls into the center of the canvas, the \n`blocks` container will stop moving. Notice that the code uses the \n`finish` sprite\u2019s global x position (`gx`) to test whether it\u2019s inside \nthe area of the canvas. Because global coordinates are relative to \nthe canvas, not the parent container, they\u2019re really useful for \njust these kinds of situations where you want to want to find a \nnested sprite\u2019s position on the canvas.\n\nMake sure you check out the complete Flappy Fairy source code in the\n`examples` folder so that you can see all this code in its proper context.\n\n<a id='htmlIntegration'></a>\n#Integration with HTML and CSS\n\nHexi works seamlessly with HTML and CSS. You can freely mix Hexi sprites and\ncode with HTML elements, and use Hexi's architecture to build an HTML\nbased application. And, you can use HTML to build a rich user\ninterface for your Hexi games.\n\nHow does it work? Hexi takes a completely hands-off approach. Just write plain old HTML and CSS, however you like,\nand then reference your HTML in your Hexi code. That's all! Hexi\ndoesn't re-invent the wheel, so you can write as much low level HTML/CSS code you like and blend it \ninto your Hexi application however you choose.\n\nYou can find a working example in the [`html` folder in Hexi's `examples`](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/tree/master/examples/38_html) in this code repository.\nIt's a simple number guessing game:\n\n![Number guessing game](/tutorials/screenshots/32.png)\n\nThe gray box that contains the button and text input field are HTML\nelements. Those HTML elements, including the button, are completely styled\nusing CSS. The dynamic text and images are Hexi sprites. \n\nThere's also\nan invisible `<div>` element that's exactly the same size, and in\nexactly the same position, as Hexi's canvas. The big `<div>` element\nfloats over the canvas and contains the gray box, button and input\nfield. \n\nLet's take a quick look at how this works. The `main.html` file looks like\nthis:\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<title>Html integration</title>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\">\n<body>\n\n<!-- UI -->\n<div id=\"ui\">\n  <div id=\"box\">\n    <button>Guess!</button>\n    <input id=\"input\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"X...\" maxlength=\"10\" autofocus>\n  <div>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Hexi -->\n<script src=\"../../src/modules/pixi.js/bin/pixi.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../../bin/modules.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../../bin/core.js\"></script>\n\n<!-- Main application file -->\n<script src=\"main.js\"></script>\n</body>\n```\nThe important part is the `UI` section, just below the `<body>` tag. A\n`div` with the id `ui` is used to enclose the box, button and input.\n\nThe magic happens in the `style.css` file. Here's the most important\npart:\n```css\ncanvas\n  { position : relative\n  }\n\n#ui\n  { position : absolute\n  ; left : 0\n  ; top : 0\n  ; width : 512px\n  ; height : 512px\n\n  /*Important: set the z-index to 1 so that it appears above Hexi's canvas*/\n  ; z-index: 1\n  }\n```\nHexi's `canvas` is set to `relative` and the `ui` div is set to\n`absolute`. `ui` is also set to **exactly** the same width and height, `512px`,\nas Hexi's canvas. Very importantly, `ui` has a `z-index` of `1`\nto force it to display above the canvas. The other HTML elements (the\nbox, button, and input field) are all positioned absolutely relative\nto the `ui` div - check the full CSS code for details.\n\nTo access the button and input field in your Hexi code, just create\nreferences to them in Hexi's `setup` function:\n```js\nfunction setup() {\n\n  //Html elements\n  var button = document.querySelector(\"button\");\n  button.addEventListener(\"click\", buttonClickHandler, false);\n  var input = document.querySelector(\"#input\");\n\n  //...The rest of the setup code creates Hexi sprites...\n```\nThen just create an ordinary function to handle the button clicks,\nlike this:\n```js\nfunction buttonClickHandler(event) {\n\n  //Capture the player's input from the HTML text input field\n  if (input.value) playersGuess = parseInt(input.value);\n\n  //...the rest of the code...\n}\n```\n`input.value` gives you access to whatever the user entered in the\ninput field. This is just plain old vanilla Web API code - nothing\nspecial!. You can use that value to change any Hexi sprite properties.\nTake a look at the source code for details, but there are no surprises.\n\nBut the example code does have one trick up it's sleeve. The entire Hexi\napplication scales up and aligns itself inside the browser. That means\nboth Hexi's canvas and the UI div scale up **and** stay aligned. They\neven re-scale and re-align if the user changes the size of the browser window. How\ndoes that work? Here's the JavaScript code that does this (in the `main.js`\nfile, just after Hexi's standard initialization code):\n```js\n//Scale Hexi's canvas\ng.scaleToWindow();\n\n//Scale the html UI <div> container\nscaleToWindow(document.querySelector(\"#ui\"));\nwindow.addEventListener(\"resize\", function(event){ \n  scaleToWindow(document.querySelector(\"#ui\"));\n});\n```\nHexi's canvas is scaled internally by the Hexi engine, but the UI layer\nis scaled using the global `scaleToWindow` function. (You can find out\nabout the `scaleToWindow` function [here](https://github.com/kittykatattack/scaleToWindow).)\n\nThis loose integration between HTML and Hexi means you're free to customize this however you\nlike. You can do crazy low-level HTML/CSS programming if you want to, mix the logic in \nwith your Hexi sprites, and design any kind of custom layout that you\nneed. It's just HTML! And, yes, you can write your HTML\nwith Angular, React or [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) (Go Elm!!) if you want to.\n\n<a id='aguidetotheexamples'></a>\n#Coming soon: A guide to the examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Thanks to @MatsMaker\n\n# Setup\nYou'll need to install a few things before you have a working copy of the project.\n\n## 1. Clone this repo:\n\nNavigate into your workspace directory.\n\nRun:\n\n```git clone https://github.com/lean/phaser-es6-webpack.git```\n\n## 2. Install node.js and npm:\n\nhttps://nodejs.org/en/\n\n\n## 3. Install dependencies (optionally you can install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)):\n\nNavigate to the cloned repo's directory.\n\nRun:\n\n```npm install``` \n\nor if you chose yarn, just run ```yarn```\n\n## 4. Run the development server:\n\nRun:\n\n```npm run dev```\n\nThis will run a server so you can run the game in a browser. It will also start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser automatically.\n\nTo run the game, open your browser and enter http://localhost:3000 into the address bar.\n\n\n## Build for deployment:\n\nRun:\n\n```npm run deploy```\n\nThis will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.\n\n## Deploy for cordova:\nMake sure to uncomment the cordova.js file in the src/index.html and to update config.xml with your informations. (name/description...)\n\nMore informations about the cordova configuration:\nhttps://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/config_ref/\n\nThere is 3 platforms actually tested and supported : \n- browser\n- ios\n- android\n\nFirst run (ios example):\n\n```\nnpm run cordova\ncordova platform add ios\ncordova run ios\n```\n\nUpdate (ios example):\n\n```\nnpm run cordova\ncordova platform update ios\ncordova run ios\n```\n\nThis will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.\n\n## Config:\nbefore you get to work you will surely want to check the config file. You could setup dimensions, webfonts, etc\n\n## Webfonts:\nIn the config file you can specify which webfonts you want to include. In case you do not want to use webfonts simply leave the array empty\n\n## Credits\nBig thanks to these great repos:\n\nhttps://github.com/belohlavek/phaser-es6-boilerplate\n\nhttps://github.com/cstuncsik/phaser-es6-demo\n\n## Contributors\n\nhttps://github.com/RenaudROHLINGER\n"

OpenSpiel\nalso includes tools to analyze learning dynamics and other common evaluation\nmetrics. Games are represented as procedural extensive-form games, with some\nnatural extensions. The core API and games are implemented in C++ and exposed to\nPython. Algorithms and tools are written both in C++ and Python.\n\nTo try OpenSpiel in Google Colaboratory, please refer to `open_spiel/colabs` subdirectory or start [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/open_spiel/blob/master/open_spiel/colabs/install_open_spiel.ipynb).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"docs/_static/OpenSpielB.png\" alt=\"OpenSpiel visual asset\">\n</p>\n\n# Index\n\nPlease choose among the following options:\n\n*   [Installing OpenSpiel](docs/install.md)\n*   [Introduction to OpenSpiel](docs/intro.md)\n*   [API Overview and First Example](docs/concepts.md)\n*   [Overview of Implemented Games](docs/games.md)\n*   [Overview of Implemented Algorithms](docs/algorithms.md)\n*   [Developer Guide](docs/developer_guide.md)\n*   [Using OpenSpiel as a C++ Library](docs/library.md)\n*   [Guidelines and Contributing](docs/contributing.md)\n*   [Authors](docs/authors.md)\n\nFor a longer introduction to the core concepts, formalisms, and terminology,\nincluding an overview of the algorithms and some results, please see\n[OpenSpiel: A Framework for Reinforcement Learning in Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09453).\n\nFor an overview of OpenSpiel and example uses of the core API, please check out\nour tutorials:\n\n*   [Motivation, Core API, Brief Intro to Replictor Dynamics and Imperfect\n    Information Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NCPqtPwlFQ) by Marc\n    Lanctot.\n    [(slides)](http://mlanctot.info/files/OpenSpiel_Tutorial_KU_Leuven_2022.pdf)\n    [(colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/open_spiel/blob/master/open_spiel/colabs/OpenSpielTutorial.ipynb)\n*   [Motivation, Core API, Implementing CFR and REINFORCE on Kuhn poker, Leduc\n    poker, and Goofspiel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6JNHoGUXCo) by Edward\n    Lockhart.\n    [(slides)](http://mlanctot.info/files/open_spiel_tutorial-mar2021-comarl.pdf)\n    [(colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/open_spiel/blob/master/open_spiel/colabs/CFR_and_REINFORCE.ipynb)\n\nIf you use OpenSpiel in your research, please cite the paper using the following\nBibTeX:\n\n```bibtex\n@article{LanctotEtAl2019OpenSpiel,\n  title     = {{OpenSpiel}: A Framework for Reinforcement Learning in Games},\n  author    = {Marc Lanctot and Edward Lockhart and Jean-Baptiste Lespiau and\n               Vinicius Zambaldi and Satyaki Upadhyay and Julien P\\'{e}rolat and\n               Sriram Srinivasan and Finbarr Timbers and Karl Tuyls and\n               Shayegan Omidshafiei and Daniel Hennes and Dustin Morrill and\n               Paul Muller and Timo Ewalds and Ryan Faulkner and J\\'{a}nos Kram\\'{a}r\n               and Bart De Vylder and Brennan Saeta and James Bradbury and David Ding\n               and Sebastian Borgeaud and Matthew Lai and Julian Schrittwieser and\n               Thomas Anthony and Edward Hughes and Ivo Danihelka and Jonah Ryan-Davis},\n  year      = {2019},\n  eprint    = {1908.09453},\n  archivePrefix = {arXiv},\n  primaryClass = {cs.LG},\n  journal   = {CoRR},\n  volume    = {abs/1908.09453},\n  url       = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09453},\n}\n```\n\n## Versioning\n\nWe use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).\n\n"

Thanks to @MatsMaker\n\n# Setup\nYou'll need to install a few things before you have a working copy of the project.\n\n## 1. Clone this repo:\n\nNavigate into your workspace directory.\n\nRun:\n\n```git clone https://github.com/lean/phaser-es6-webpack.git```\n\n## 2. Install node.js and npm:\n\nhttps://nodejs.org/en/\n\n\n## 3. Install dependencies (optionally you can install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)):\n\nNavigate to the cloned repo's directory.\n\nRun:\n\n```npm install``` \n\nor if you chose yarn, just run ```yarn```\n\n## 4. Run the development server:\n\nRun:\n\n```npm run dev```\n\nThis will run a server so you can run the game in a browser. It will also start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser automatically.\n\nTo run the game, open your browser and enter http://localhost:3000 into the address bar.\n\n\n## Build for deployment:\n\nRun:\n\n```npm run deploy```\n\nThis will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.\n\n## Deploy for cordova:\nMake sure to uncomment the cordova.js file in the src/index.html and to update config.xml with your informations. (name/description...)\n\nMore informations about the cordova configuration:\nhttps://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/config_ref/\n\nThere is 3 platforms actually tested and supported : \n- browser\n- ios\n- android\n\nFirst run (ios example):\n\n```\nnpm run cordova\ncordova platform add ios\ncordova run ios\n```\n\nUpdate (ios example):\n\n```\nnpm run cordova\ncordova platform update ios\ncordova run ios\n```\n\nThis will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.\n\n## Config:\nbefore you get to work you will surely want to check the config file. You could setup dimensions, webfonts, etc\n\n## Webfonts:\nIn the config file you can specify which webfonts you want to include. In case you do not want to use webfonts simply leave the array empty\n\n## Credits\nBig thanks to these great repos:\n\nhttps://github.com/belohlavek/phaser-es6-boilerplate\n\nhttps://github.com/cstuncsik/phaser-es6-demo\n\n## Contributors\n\nhttps://github.com/RenaudROHLINGER\n"

It includes a deterministic 2D physics engine, pathfinding, behavior system, and more. LSF is integrated with Unity.\n\nSpecial thanks to Liv Games (http://www.livgames.com), 360 Studio (http://www.360studio.me), and Thoopid (http://www.thoopid.com/) for supporting the development of Lockstep Framework. Also, thank you GladFox (https://github.com/GladFox) and the community for helping with development.\n\nCreated by John Pan (https://github.com/SnpM).\n\nNOTE: LSF is no longer being actively developed. The [latest commit](https://github.com/SnpM/LockstepFramework/commit/d7819df4005316d8c0e3148728794f7c2b921a7a) targets Unity 2019.1f1.\n\nFeatures\n------------------------\n- Deterministic math library and simulation\n- Custom 2D physics engine on the X-Z plane\n- Behaviour system for both individual agents and globally\n- Lockstep variables - know when and where desyncs happen\n- Size-based pathfinding (big units won't get stuck in narrow gaps)\n- Customizable database system\n- Support for DarkRift and Photon Networking (Forge Networking support deprecated but let me know if you need it)\n\nQuick Setup\n-----------\n1. Import the framework into a Unity project and open Lockstep-Framework/Example/ExampleScene\n2. Set up the database and settings by navigating to the Lockstep/Database window or pressing Control - Shift - L.\n3. In the Settings foldout of the database window, click Load and navigate to Lockstep-Framework/Example/ExampleDatabase/Example_Database.asset to load the preconfigured database for the example.\n4. Play!\n\nNote: The example only shows the basic functionality of the framework. Comprehensive examples will be added close to the end of core development.\n\n**Tutorials and more**\n---------\nTo find out more about Lockstep Framework, please explore the wiki (https://github.com/SnpM/LockstepFramework/wiki) and feel free to ask us questions.\n\nCheck out tutorial series here: https://github.com/SnpM/LockstepFramework/wiki/Tutorial-Series\n\n\nLicense\n--------\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 John Pan\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

In order to win you must be the first player to get rid of all of your cards. Each turn, all of the players reveal one of their cards. If two cards are identical, those players must make a grab for the Totem.

Catan: Explorers & Pirates differs from the Catan base game in three main ways. First, instead of having only a single island in the game on which players build and compete for resources, three islands are present. Second, instead of using cities, Catan: Explorers & Pirates allows players to build port settlements. Like cities, port settlements are worth two victory points (VPs), and the number of VPs required to win depends on the scenario. Third, if a player receives no resources during the production roll (other than on a roll of 7), she receives one gold in compensation. The winner is the first one who reaches 17 VPs.\n\n![Catan image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/itemrep/img/mSwnoBBEdGDnzC5wlDVU9dhpIyA=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc()/pic2420310.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

It's an experiment, a journey, a team experience in which you can't exchange information, yet will become one to defeat all the levels of the game. In more detail, the deck contains cards numbered 1-100, and during the game you try to complete 12, 10, or 8 levels of play with 2, 3, or 4 players. In a level, each player receives a hand of cards equal to the number of the level: one card in level 1, two cards in level 2, etc. Collectively you must play these cards into the center of the table on a single discard pile in ascending order but you cannot communicate with one another in any way as to which cards you hold. You simply stare into one another's eyes, and when you feel the time is right, you play your lowest card. If no one holds a card lower than what you played, great, the game continues! If someone did, all players discard face up all cards lower than what you played, and you lose one life.\n\n![The Mind image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/itemrep/img/w6x_ahGLQVe2u6trDx0kO91OprM=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc()/pic3979766.png)\n\n| Players | Min.

The player who succeeds in doing this best becomes the new \"Obermufti\" of Marrakesh.\n> Marrakesh is played over three rounds, with each round consisting of four turns. On each turn, players simultaneously and secretly choose three colored cylinders from behind their screen. Then, in turn order, they place matching colored assistants on their player board and perform the corresponding action, then all cylinders are placed in the cube tower. Then, in turn order, players select a color and take 1-2 of the cylinders that have passed through the tower (or those that were stuck from a previous round but have now emerged) and place them on their player boards. These cylinders will enhance future actions taken in the same color in future rounds. Actions allow players to gain wealth, which can be traded for influence in the city. Performing various actions also earns bonuses and enhances actions even more as the game proceeds. The player who scores the most points by the end of the game wins.\n\n![Marrakesh image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zSMdU8DMBBvW2LIOjVCM7A__itemrep/img/-RnOaoGEX9YStxHqYm3x4Vvk8Nc=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc()/pic6289695.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Players take turns pushing the marbles around the board, with the goal of pushing six of the opposing player's marbles off the board. The central idea is that a column of marbles has weight given by the number of marbles in line. Someone will need to push with a heavier group of marbles in order to push the column along that axis. However, with six possible directions, it's difficult to defend yourself perfectly. Also, it's possible to play the game with up to six players when supplemental marble sets are purchased.\n\n![Abalone image](http://cdn.aktivcommunication.cz/images/products/box/4426.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Each player has nine pieces, or \"men\", usually coloured black and white. Players try to form 'mills'\u2014three of their own men lined horizontally or vertically\u2014allowing a player to remove an opponent's man from the game. A player wins by reducing the opponent to two pieces (where they could no longer form mills and thus be unable to win), or by leaving them without a legal move.\n\n![Nine Men's Morris image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Nine_Men%27s_Morris_board_with_coordinates.svg/300px-Nine_Men%27s_Morris_board_with_coordinates.svg.png)\n\n| Players | Min.

Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.\n\n![Scrabble image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mVmmntn2oQd0PfFrWBvwIQ__itemrep/img/xtiNZzN_7T6xZ3EPxzgYcBz9Ydk=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc()/pic404651.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

There are two grids for each player. One grid is used for placing your own vessels and tracking hits made against you, while the second grid is for marking the hits targeted at your opponent. Take turns firing shots by calling out one of the grid\u2019s plot points. If a hit doesn\u2019t strike a ship, it\u2019s considered a miss and pegged with white pieces. If a hit makes contact with a ship, then that strike gets pegged with red. The number of hits each kind of vessel can sustain before it sinks is varied. After some initial exploratory firing, you will likely start to figure out the location of your opponent\u2019s ships and begin to deal the fatal blows. It\u2019s a battle on the high seas!\n\n![Battleship image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dUh-sb2V8CyDjBDvwzf-qg__itemrep/img/_U6cCRlORa_Ex4emUsVXE77bCbo=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc()/pic1293566.jpg)\n\n| Players | Min.

Come chat with us on Discord!\n\n[<strong>Join the Ultralight Discord!</strong> <img src=\"media/discord-logo.svg\">](https://chat.ultralig.ht)\n\n# About\n\nUltralight is an ultra-fast, ultra-light, standards-compliant HTML renderer for applications and games. It supports most modern HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript features while still remaining light in binary size and memory usage.\n\nCurrently available for Windows, macOS, and Linux (64-bit only, ARM64 coming).\n\nOfficial API is available for C and C++, with community bindings for C#, Rust, Java, and Go [available here](https://docs.ultralig.ht/docs/language-bindings).\n\nGet started now by [reading the docs](https://docs.ultralig.ht).\n\n## Next-Generation HTML Renderer\n\nYou can think of Ultralight like a smaller, lighter, cross-platform WebKit that's more customizable and designed to display HTML in an existing app rather than function as a standalone browser.\n\nThe API allows you to integrate your native code deeply with JavaScript (we offer bare-metal access to the JavaScriptCore VM API) and allows you to customize file system loaders, font loading, clipboard integration, and even drawing itself (via GPU display lists or the Surface API).\n\n\n## For Games\n\nRender HTML to an in-game texture using our CPU renderer or take performance to the next level using our GPU renderer.\n\nTake advantage of our low-level platform API\u2014 load HTML assets directly from your game's existing asset pipeline using the FileSystem interface.\n\n__\u2192 Learn more by visiting our [Game Integration Guide](https://docs.ultralig.ht/docs/integrating-with-games).__\n\n## For Desktop Apps\n\nGet the best of both worlds by building your native C/C++ desktop app's front-end with modern HTML/CSS/JS.\n\nTake advantage of our AppCore framework to launch cross-platform windows and render to OS-native GPU surfaces (D3D11, D3D12, Metal, OpenGL, and more).\n\n_AppCore is currently under active development and only supports single-window apps at this writing. A number of planned features (app icons, automatic packager, borderless windows with custom draggable titlebars, etc) are missing but on the way._\n\n__\u2192 Learn more by visiting our [Desktop App Guide](https://docs.ultralig.ht/docs/writing-your-first-app).__\n\n### Base Memory Usage\n\n|             | Ultralight  | Electron  |\n|-------------|-------------|-----------|\n| __Windows__ | 9 MB        | 72 MB     |\n| __macOS__   | 17 MB       | 97 MB     |\n| __Linux__   | 15 MB       | 136 MB    |\n\n### Base Distributable Size\n\n|             | Ultralight  | Electron  |\n|-------------|-------------|-----------|\n| __Windows__ | 40 MB       | 147 MB    |\n| __macOS__   | 55 MB       | 163 MB    |\n| __Linux__   | 55 MB       | 179 MB    |\n\n### Comparison with Chromium\n\n|                       | Ultralight               | Chromium                    |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| __Renderer__          | Proprietary (GPU or CPU) | Skia (CPU) / GPU Compositor |\n| __Layout Engine__     | WebCore (WebKit fork)    | Blink                       |\n| __JavaScript VM__     | JavaScriptCore           | V8                          |\n| __IPC__               | None (Single Process)    | Yes (Multi Process)         |\n\n# Architecture\n\nUltralight is a new port of WebKit combined with a new lightweight renderer intended specifically for embedding in apps and games.\n\nPortions of the library are open-source, here's how the library is laid out:\n\n|                    | Description                       | License     | Source Code              |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|\n| __UltralightCore__ | Low-level graphics renderer       | Proprietary | (Available with license) |\n| __WebCore__        | HTML layout engine (WebKit fork)  | LGPL/BSD    | [ultralight-ux/WebCore](https://github.com/ultralight-ux/WebCore) |\n| __Ultralight__     | View, compositor, and event logic | Proprietary | (Avaiable with license)  |\n| __AppCore__        | Optional, desktop app runtime     | LGPL        | [ultralight-ux/AppCore](https://github.com/ultralight-ux/AppCore) |\n\n## Dual High-Performance Renderers\n\nWe support two different renderers for integration into a variety of target environments.\n\n### GPU Renderer\n\nOur optional, high-performance GPU renderer can render HTML directly on the GPU. All painting is performed via virtual display lists and translated to your target graphics platform at runtime. For more info, see [Using a Custom GPUDriver](https://docs.ultralig.ht/docs/using-a-custom-gpudriver).\n\nThe GPU renderer is enabled by default when using Ultralight via the AppCore runtime.\n\n### CPU Renderer\n\nFor easier integration into games and other complex environments, Ultralight can render to an offscreen pixel buffer using an SIMD-accelerated CPU rendering pipeline. Fore more info, see the [Game Integration Guide](https://docs.ultralig.ht/docs/integrating-with-games).\n\nThe library can also render to a user-supplied pixel buffer via the Surface API (see [Using a Custom Surface](https://docs.ultralig.ht/docs/using-a-custom-surface)).\n\nPaths, gradients, and patterns in this mode are rasterized using [Blend2D's high-performance JIT compiler](https://blend2d.com).\n\n# Licensing\n\n## Free License\n\nUltralight is __free__ for non-commercial use and __free__ for commercial use by companies with less than $100K gross annual revenue.

  "readme_contents": "easyAI\n======\n\nEasyAI (full documentation here_) is a pure-Python artificial intelligence framework for two-players abstract games such as Tic Tac Toe, Connect 4, Reversi, etc.\nIt makes it easy to define the mechanisms of a game, and play against the computer or solve the game.\nUnder the hood, the AI is a Negamax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and transposition tables as described on Wikipedia_.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nIf you have ``pip`` installed, type this in a terminal ::\n    \n    sudo pip install easyAI\n    \nOtherwise, download the source code (for instance on Github_), unzip everything into one folder and in this folder, in a terminal, type ::\n    \n    sudo python setup.py install\n\nAdditionally you will need to install Numpy to be able to run some of the examples.\n\n\nA quick example\n----------------\n\nLet us define the rules of a game and start a match against the AI:\n\n.. code:: python\n    \n    from easyAI import TwoPlayerGame, Human_Player, AI_Player, Negamax\n    \n    class GameOfBones( TwoPlayerGame ):\n        \"\"\" In turn, the players remove one, two or three bones from a\n        pile of bones. The player who removes the last bone loses. \"\"\"\n            \n        def __init__(self, players=None):\n            self.players = players\n            self.pile = 20 # start with 20 bones in the pile\n            self.current_player = 1 # player 1 starts\n\n        def possible_moves(self): return ['1','2','3']\n        def make_move(self,move): self.pile -= int(move) # remove bones.\n        def win(self): return self.pile<=0 # opponent took the last bone ?\n        def is_over(self): return self.win() # Game stops when someone wins.\n        def show(self): print (\"%d bones left in the pile\" % self.pile)\n        def scoring(self): return 100 if game.win() else 0 # For the AI\n    \n    # Start a match (and store the history of moves when it ends)\n    ai = Negamax(13) # The AI will think 13 moves in advance \n    game = GameOfBones( [ Human_Player(), AI_Player(ai) ] )\n    history = game.play()\n    \nResult: ::\n    \n    20 bones left in the pile\n    \n    Player 1 what do you play ? 3\n\n    Move #1: player 1 plays 3 :\n    17 bones left in the pile\n\n    Move #2: player 2 plays 1 :\n    16 bones left in the pile\n    \n    Player 1 what do you play ?\n\nSolving the game\n*****************\n\nLet us now solve the game:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from easyAI import solve_with_iterative_deepening\n    r,d,m = solve_with_iterative_deepening(\n        game=GameOfBones(),\n        ai_depths=range(2,20),\n        win_score=100\n    )\n\nWe obtain ``r=1``, meaning that if both players play perfectly, the first player to play can always win (-1 would have meant always lose), ``d=10``, which means that the wins will be in ten moves (i.e. 5 moves per player) or less, and ``m='3'``, which indicates that the first player's first move should be ``'3'``.\n\nThese computations can be speed up using a transposition table which will store the situations encountered and the best moves for each:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    tt = TranspositionTable()\n    GameOfBones.ttentry = lambda game : game.pile # key for the table\n    r,d,m = solve_with_iterative_deepening(\n        game=GameOfBones(),\n        ai_depths=range(2,20),\n        win_score=100,\n        tt=tt\n    )\n\nAfter these lines are run the variable ``tt`` contains a transposition table storing the possible situations (here, the possible sizes of the pile) and the optimal moves to perform. With ``tt`` you can play perfectly without *thinking*:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    game = GameOfBones( [  AI_Player( tt ), Human_Player() ] )\n    game.play() # you will always lose this game :)\n\n\nContribute !\n------------\n\nEasyAI is an open source software originally written by Zulko_ and released under the MIT licence. Contributions welcome! Some ideas: AI algos for incomplete information games, better game solving strategies, (efficient) use of databases to store moves,  AI algorithms using parallelisation.\n\nFor troubleshooting and bug reports, the best for now is to ask on Github_.\n\nHow releases work\n*****************\n\nEvery time a MR gets merged into master, an automatic release happens:\n\n- If the last commit's message starts with `[FEATURE]`, a feature release happens (`1.3.3 -> 1.4.0`)\n- If the last commit's message starts with `[MAJOR]`, a major release happens (`1.3.3 -> 2.0.0`)\n- If the last commit's message starts with `[SKIP]`, no release happens.\n- Otherwise, a patch release happens (`1.3.3 -> 1.3.4`)\n\n\n\nMaintainers\n-----------\n\n- Zulko_ (owner)\n- JohnAD_\n\n\n.. _here: http://zulko.github.io/easyAI\n.. _Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax\n.. _Zulko : https://github.com/Zulko\n.. _JohnAD : https://github.com/JohnAD\n.. _Github :  https://github.com/Zulko/easyAI\n"

Start a game in any channel or private group with 2-10 players. PokerBot will deal hands, direct message players with their hole cards, query players for their action, determine the winning hand, and handle the pot.\n\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/3w3k222T0A1o2e0d033Q/Image%202015-09-01%20at%2011.41.33%20PM.png)\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/2a073W0Q1Y2N0O2U1i3p/Image%202015-09-01%20at%2011.39.28%20PM.png)\n\nSee it [in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joku-PKUObE).\n\n## Getting Started\n1. Create a new [bot integration](https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot)\n1. Follow the steps to deploy the bot to Heroku or run it locally\n1. Once the bot is running, start a game with: `@<your-bot-name>: deal`\n\n#### One-Click Heroku\nClick this button:\n\n[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)\n\n#### Manual Heroku\n1. Install [Heroku toolbelt](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up)\n1. Create a new bot integration (as above)\n1. `heroku create`\n1. `heroku config:set SLACK_POKER_BOT_TOKEN=[Your API token]`\n1. `git push heroku master`\n\n#### To Run Locally\n1. Create a `token.txt` file and paste your API token there\n1. `npm install`\n1. `node src/main.js`\n\n## Directions\n* To start a game, `@<your-bot-name>: deal`.\n* To end a game, `@<your-bot-name>: quit game`. The game will end once the current hand finishes.\nNote that any player can end a game at any time with this command, so Be Honorable\u2122.\n* To configure some bot options, `@<your-bot-name>: config <name-of-option>=<value>`. The supported options are:\n```\ntimeout: Sets the duration (in seconds) before a player times out. \nSet to 0 to specify no timeout.\n```\nSo, to start a game without any player timeout, say:\n```\n@<your-bot-name>: config timeout=0\n@<your-bot-name>: deal\n```\n\nCheck the open issues for some planned enhancements.\n\n### AI Players\nAlthough this client was built for managing human players in a Slack channel, it has some support for AI players. To add a bot player:\n\n1. Add a bot class under the `ai/` folder\n1. Implement `getAction`, which is called whenever it is the bot's turn\n1. Modify the `addBotPlayers` method in `src/bot.js` to add your bot to every game\n\n### Test All The Things\nTo run tests, simply do:\n\n1. `gulp`\n\nThe tests produce legible output that matches what users in Slack would see. This is the same test suite that is run on each pull request. This is very helpful when diagnosing a logic bug:\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/2L0Y2Y3d3g0i1x171n2V/Image%202015-09-08%20at%207.00.40%20PM.png)\n\n### Dependencies\n* [NodeJS Slack Client](https://github.com/slackhq/node-slack-client)\n`node-slack-client` abstracts the basics of a Slack bot, including authentication, getting messages from players, and posting messages or attachments to the channel.\n\n* [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS)\nThe majority of this client is written using `RxJS`. It simplifies many of the complex player polling interactions, that would otherwise be Death By Timers, into very legible code.\n\n* [Imgur](https://github.com/kaimallea/node-imgur) / [Lightweight Image Processor](https://github.com/EyalAr/lwip)\nEach card is a separate image, and board images are created on the fly by pasting several cards onto a single canvas (with the help of  `lwip`). The resulting image is than uploaded to `imgur`, which gives us a single URL that can be passed as an attachment to the Slack API. This route was chosen to avoid uploading 318,505,200 images to the cloud, and allows us to modify the card assets easily.\n\n* [Poker Evaluator](https://github.com/chenosaurus/poker-evaluator)\n`poker-evaluator` is used for evaluating the winning hand when it comes time to show down. Here it has been extended to calculate the best 5-card hand from any 7-card hand.\n\n* [MochaJS](http://mochajs.org/)\nMost of the tricky client logic is backed up by tests, which were written using `MochaJS`.\n\n* [Vector Playing Cards](https://code.google.com/p/vector-playing-cards/)\n"

Hotpot helps you create attractive [game assets](https://hotpot.ai/templates/game_asset?s=github_game_assets), [App Store screenshots](https://hotpot.ai/templates/iphone_xs_max?s=github_game_assets), [Google Play screenshots](https://hotpot.ai/templates/samsung_s9?s=github_game_assets), [app icons](https://hotpot.ai/templates/app_store_icon?s=github_game_assets), [logos](https://hotpot.ai/templates/text_design?s=github_game_assets) and other graphics for games, apps, and extensions.\n\nThis guide was originally posted on [Hotpot.ai](https://hotpot.ai/blog/game_assets), and is cross-referenced here for developer convenience and to simplify community contributions.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis page documents both free and paid assets and resources for making Unity games, iOS games, Android games, 2D games, 3D games, and other games. While most of these game assets and game resources are free, some may also offer paid assets through a freemium model. Where possible, we avoid stricly paid assets and resources unless they are best-in-class.\n\nThere are countless assets and resources online to help developers craft incredible games. We spent hours pruning these options and selecting only the best ones to help accelerate game development. Our research produced more than 150 services and resources that span the spectrum of game development, from general game assets to sprites, sounds, music, tile assets, background patterns, and more.\n\nWe do not summarize assets or highlight free ones because free game assets and resources frequently change their terms or purpose, probably because maintaining free resources is not sustainable for most businesses. Other lists that provide summaries or tag free resources commonly become stale as a result.\n\n## List Suggestions\n\nTo add or remove items from this list, please make a pull request.\n\n## AI

Clone the repo (https://github.com/BenFradet/RiotSharp.git) or [download the zip file](https://github.com/BenFradet/RiotSharp/archive/develop.zip).\n\n2. Build the RiotSharp project and add the library to your own application.\n\n### Build your own latest NuGet package\nYou can build your own NuGet package of the latest version with the following command:\n```\ndotnet pack /p:Configuration=Release\n```\nExecute it from the Visual Studio developer command prompt from inside the RiotSharp project folder. \nThen copy the `RiotSharp.*.nupkg` file from the `bin` folder into your local NuGet feed. [Create local NuGet feed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/tools/package-manager-ui#package-sources)\n\n## Usage\n\n### Main API\nIn order to use the API you need an API key which you can get [here](https://developer.riotgames.com/).\n\nEntry point to the API if you do not own a production API key:\n```c#\nvar api = RiotApi.GetDevelopmentInstance(\"YOUR_API_KEY\");\n```\n\nIf you do own a production API key you can specify your own rate limits:\n```c#\nvar api = RiotApi.GetInstance(\"YOUR_API_KEY\",\n  yourRateLimitPer10s, yourRateLimitPer10m);\n```\n\nTo get basic data of a summoner:\n```c#\ntry\n{\n  var summoner = api.Summoner.GetSummonerByNameAsync(Region.Euw, \"SUMMONER_NAME\").Result;\n  var name = summoner.Name;\n  var level = summoner.Level;\n  var accountId = summoner.AccountId;\n}\ncatch (RiotSharpException ex)\n{\n  // Handle the exception however you want.\n}\n```\nEach class represents an API:\n* Account\n* Champion\n* League  \n* Match  \n* Spectator  \n* Status  \n* Summoner \n* ChampionMastery  \n* StaticData  \n* ThirdParty  \n\n\nYou can find a list of all the available operations in [RiotApi in the documentation](http://benfradet.github.io/RiotSharp/api/RiotSharp.RiotApi.html) \nor test some queries on the [Riot Developer Portal](https://developer.riotgames.com/apis)\n\n### Tournament API\n\nYou first have to apply for a tournament API key [here](https://developer.riotgames.com/).\n\nEntry point for the tournament API:\n```c#\nvar tournamentApi = TournamentRiotApi.GetInstance(\"TOURNAMENT_API_KEY\");\n```\n\nNext up, create a provider.\nThe url will receive callbacks with match results.\n```c#\nvar provider = tournamentApi.CreateProvider(Region.Euw, url);\n```\n\nAnd create a tournament:\n```c#\nvar tournament = tournamentApi.CreateTournament(provider.Id, \"TOURNAMENT_NAME\");\n```\n\nNow you can create tournament codes (which you can use to join games):\n```c#\nvar tournamentCode = tournamentApi.CreateTournamentCode(tournament.Id,\n    teamSize, allowedSummonerIds, TournamentSpectatorType.All,\n    TournamentPickType.TournamentDraft, TournamentMapType.SummonnersRift,\n    string.Empty);\n```\n\nThe tournament code can now be entered in the client to join a game with the specified settings.\nPlease note that you should save the provider and tournament IDs if you wish to create more tournament codes later on. You should not create a separate provider and tournament ID for every tournament code. Make sure to read Riot's [guidelines](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/tournaments-api) on this topic.\n\nTo create a Tournament object for an existing tournament, use the following syntax:\n```c#\nvar tournament = new Tournament { Id = id };\n```\n\nYou can then create codes in two ways:\n```c#\ntournament.CreateTournamentCode(teamSize, allowedSummonerIds,\n    TournamentSpectatorType.All, TournamentPickType.TournamentDraft,\n    TournamentMapType.SummonnersRift, string.Empty);\n```\n\nor, alternatively, if you do not wish to create a separate Tournament object, you can call the `CreateTournamentCode` method directly from the API as shown previously.\n\nYou can find a list of all the available operations in [TournamentRiotApi in the documentation](http://benfradet.github.io/RiotSharp/api/RiotSharp.TournamentRiotApi.html).\n\n### Data Dragon / Static API\n\nYou can retrieve static information about the game thanks to the static API (Data Dragon), there is no rate limiting on this API and RiotSharp\ncaches as much data as possible to make as few calls as possible.\n\nDataDragon API is hidden in Main API.\n```c#\nvar someData = api.DataDragon.SomeEndpoint.SomeMethod();\n```\n\nFor example, you can retrieve data about all champions:\n```c#\nvar allVersion = api.DataDragon.Versions.GetAllAsync().Result;\nvar latestVersion = allVersion[0]; // Example of version: \"10.23.1\"\nvar champions = api.DataDragon.Champions.GetAllAsync(latestVersion).Result.Champions.Values;\nforeach (var champion in champions)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(champion.Name);\n    Console.WriteLine(champion.Lore);\n}\n```\n\nAdditionally, you can use the regular API and static API to, for example, retrieve champion masteries for the summoner:\n```c#\nList<ChampionMastery> championMasteries;\ntry\n{\n    championMasteries =  api.ChampionMastery.GetChampionMasteriesAsync(summoner.Region, summoner.Id).Result;\n}\ncatch (RiotSharpException ex)\n{\n    // Handle the exception however you want.\n    return;\n}\n\nforeach (var championMastery in championMasteries)\n{\n    var id = championMastery.ChampionId;\n    var name = api.DataDragon.Champions.GetAllAsync(latestVersion).Result.Champions.Values.Single(x => x.Id == id).Name; // using System.Linq;\n    var level = championMastery.ChampionLevel;\n    var points = championMastery.ChampionPoints;\n\n    Console.WriteLine($\" \u2022  **Level {level} {name}** {points} Points\");\n}\n```\n\nFor a full description check the [RiotSharpTest](RiotSharpTest) project.\n\n## Contribution\n\nSimply send a pull request! The [up-for-grabs](https://github.com/BenFradet/RiotSharp/labels/up-for-grabs) label is a great place to start.\n\nWhen adding new features, please provide the related unit tests within the pull request.\nTo run the unit tests you need to modify the [App.config](RiotSharpTest/App.config) file and fill out the appropriate values so the tests can run.\n\nMoreover, the documentation is far from perfect so every bit of help is more than welcome.\n\n## Libraries used\n\nThis wrapper uses [Json.NET](http://james.newtonking.com/json).\n\n## License\n\nThis wrapper is under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nRiotSharp isn't endorsed by Riot Games and doesn't reflect the views or opinions of Riot Games or anyone officially involved in producing or managing League of Legends.

  "readme_contents": "# ImGui.NET\n\nThis is a .NET wrapper for the immediate mode GUI library, Dear ImGui (https://github.com/ocornut/imgui). ImGui.NET lets you build graphical interfaces using a simple immediate-mode style. ImGui.NET is a .NET Standard library, and can be used on all major .NET runtimes and operating systems.\n\nIncluded is a basic sample program that shows how to use the library, and renders the UI using [Veldrid](https://github.com/mellinoe/veldrid), a portable graphics library for .NET. By itself, Dear ImGui does not care what technology you use for rendering; it simply outputs textured triangles. Example renderers also exist for MonoGame and OpenTK (OpenGL).\n\nThis wrapper is built on top of [cimgui](https://github.com/Extrawurst/cimgui), which exposes a plain C API for Dear ImGui. If you are using Windows, OSX, or a mainline Linux distribution, then the ImGui.NET NuGet package comes bundled with a pre-built native library. If you are using another operating system, then you may need to build the native library yourself; see the cimgui repo for build instructions.\n\n[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/ImGui.NET.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ImGui.NET)\n\n[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/ImGui-NET/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/ImGui-NET/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/ImGui-NET/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\n# Building\n\nImGui.NET can be built in Visual Studio or on the command line. The .NET Core SDK is needed to build on the command line, and it can be downloaded [here](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core). Visual Studio 2017 is the minimum VS version supported for building.\n\n# Usage\n\nImGui.NET currently provides a raw wrapper around the ImGui native API, and also provides a very thin safe, managed API for convenience. It is currently very much like using the native library, which is very simple, flexible, and robust. The easiest way to figure out how to use the library is to read the documentation of imgui itself, mostly in the imgui.cpp, and imgui.h files, as well as the exported functions in cimgui.h. Looking at the [sample program code](https://github.com/mellinoe/ImGui.NET/tree/master/src) will also give some indication about basic usage.\n\n# Debugging native code\n\nImGui.NET is a wrapper over native code. By default, this native code is packaged and released in an optimized form, making debugging difficult. To obtain a debuggable version of the native code, follow these steps:\n\n1. Clone the [ImGui.NET-nativebuild](https://github.com/mellinoe/ImGui.NET-nativebuild) repo, at the tag matching the version of ImGui.NET you are using.\n2. In the ImGui.NET-nativebuild repo, run `build.cmd debug` or `build.sh debug` (depending on your platform).\n3. Copy the produced binaries (cimgui.dll, libcimgui.so, or libcimgui.dylib) into your application.\n4. Run the program under a native debugger, or enable mixed-mode debugging in Visual Studio.\n\n# See Also\n\nhttps://github.com/ocornut/imgui\n> Dear ImGui is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic and self-contained (no external dependencies).\n\n> Dear ImGui is designed to enable fast iterations and to empower programmers to create content creation tools and visualization / debug tools (as opposed to UI for the average end-user). It favors simplicity and productivity toward this goal, and lacks certain features normally found in more high-level libraries.\n\n> Dear ImGui is particularly suited to integration in games engine (for tooling), real-time 3D applications, fullscreen applications, embedded applications, or any applications on consoles platforms where operating system features are non-standard.\n\nSee the [official screenshot thread](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/123) for examples of many different kinds of interfaces created with Dear ImGui.\n\nhttps://github.com/cimgui/cimgui\n> This is a thin c-api wrapper for the excellent C++ intermediate gui imgui. This library is intended as a intermediate layer to be able to use imgui from other languages that can interface with C .\n"

I've tested it on Windows, but there isn't any reason it wouldn't work on Linux as well. Just change the top line from `#! python3` to `#!/usr/bin/python3` and it should be fine. \n\nBig shout-out to [@ergoithz](https://github.com/ergoithz) and their amazing function that finds the xpath for a given BeautifulSoup object. These updates wouldn't be possible without it! Check out their super-helpful function here: https://gist.github.com/ergoithz/6cf043e3fdedd1b94fcf\n\nAnother *huge* shout-out to [@SonOfDiablo](https://github.com/SonOfDiablo) for creating and providing their awesome PowerShell script for installing geckodriver on Windows! Now you don't have to follow all the steps mentioned before. Just install the PowerShell script, and run it. This will: download and install the latest geckodriver for the correct architecture, install it, and add it to your path if it isn't already there: automagically! Find the script here: https://gist.github.com/SonOfDiablo/81f3d610295c69c777b512e4da90393d\n\nFinally, a warm thank you to:\n  - [@Andriesmenze](https://github.com/Andriesmenze) for fixing the script to work in the EU due to certain pop-ups that I wasn't seeing. Their work is very appreciated!\n  - [@Steve-Tech](https://github.com/Steve-Tech) for adding some code to click the \"Sign in with Epic Games\" that apparently shows up now.\n  - [@Spifffff](https://github.com/Spifffff) for modifying the Xpath for the cookies banner, for noticing that EGS requires email-only for logging in now, and for modifying the script to work with the games carousel that shows up sometimes\n  - [@lemasato](https://github.com/lemasato) for adding 2FA support, adding some more reliability and readability changes as well as adding functionality for multiple accounts to be used and staying on top of changes they do to the site like text on buttons and what not.\n  - [@Medallyon](https://github.com/Medallyon) for cleaning up my README file, adding \"requirements.txt\" functionality, and making some important syntax changes as well as some credential detection stuff. This will help cut down on install time/complexity significantly.\n  - [@astranberg](https://github.com/astranberg) for expanding on multi-user support so you can now collect all the free games for multiple accounts.\n\nHope you enjoy!\n  #! Mason Stooksbury\n\n### Updates! (12/21/2020)\n  - Multi-user support so that free games can be claimed for as many accounts as you have.\n  - Thank you again! In just a month we've gained like 20 more stars for a total of 80! And almost 10 more forks! You all continue to humble me with the amount of support this thing has gotten. Thank you again, and may your 2021 be so much better than this year.\n\n# Setup\n\n## Requirements\n\nFirst, clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/MasonStooksbury/Free-Games.git`. Then,\n\n1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to automatically install dependencies\n\n***OR***\n\nInstall them manually:\n  + `pip install lxml` (for parsing the HTML from the webpage)\n  + `pip install selenium` (for \"roboting\" the website)\n  + `pip install beautifulsoup4` (for better/more robust finding of objects and things)\n  + `pip install pyotp` (for two-factor authentication)\n\n### Additionally\n\n+ `GeckoDriver` (selenium needs this) Linux users can use this script to do everything for you after installing \"jq\" which is a JSON processor: https://gist.github.com/cgoldberg/4097efbfeb40adf698a7d05e75e0ff51. Windows users can use this script provided by [@SonOfDiablo:](https://github.com/SonOfDiablo:) https://gist.github.com/SonOfDiablo/81f3d610295c69c777b512e4da90393d.\n+ [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/) - You can technically do all of this with Chrome, but it involves some more setup with selenium and particular drivers and I'm just too lazy. This works perfectly fine.\n+ Enter the `EPIC_EMAIL` and `EPIC_PASSWORD` variables in the `.env` file to match your Epic Games Store account. Don't include any quotes here.\n+ You may add multiple user accounts using comma separated values, e.g. `EPIC_EMAIL=a@a.com,b@b.com` `EPIC_PASSWORD=pass1,pass2`\n+ While the scipt will technically work without 2FA enabled on your epic account, you will likely see many more captchas. In order to avoid this, follow the steps [here](###Two-factor-authentication) to enable 2FA on your account and configure the script to work with your 2FA secret. \n+ Finally, you may also want to jump into `Free_Games.py` and replace the `user_agent` variable (but you don't have to). There are instructions inside the script on how to do this. \n\n### Two-factor authentication\n\nIf you already have 2FA enabled on your account, you will be required to disable it temporarily. This is required to retrieve the key we need.\n\n1. Go to [your Epic account settings](https://www.epicgames.com/account/password) and enable \"**Authenticator App**\".\n1. Keep a copy of the \"**Manual Entry Key**\". This will be used later in the python script. Do not close the page yet.\n1. On your phone, download [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en) or another similar application.\n1. Using the application, scan the QR code visible on browser. Enter the code obtained from the application on the browser and click \"**Activate**\".\n1. Keep a copy of the \"**Rescue Codes**\". This will come in handy to retrieve your account if you ever lose access to your Authentificator application (losing phone, etc.)\n1. In the python script, input the \"**Manual Entry Key**\" retrieved earlier in the corresponding field, again leaving the single quotes as is.\n1. Done!\n\n### Finally\n\nNow all you have to do is run `python Free_Games.py`, sit back & relax while your free games are being claimed (actually, you may have to complete a captcha upon signing in , but that's it).\n\n# Setting up Windows Task Scheduler\n\nThese steps should help you get Windows Task Scheduler setup in such a way that it will wake your computer from sleep and grab your free games then go back to sleep. It will also be setup to run again if something goes wrong as well as kill itself if it goes haywire. I realize the first picture shows it being setup for Vista and Windows Server 2008, but this was the only way it would work on Windows 10 without doing some wonky BIOS setup that only worked for some people.\n\n1.

Any method call from the Riot API is a request that counts towards your rate limit, except requests regarding static data which count toward a method rate limit but not toward your app rate limit. The below code makes 2 requests; one request for a summoner, and another for the match list of a summoner.\n\n```java\nimport net.rithms.riot.api.ApiConfig;\nimport net.rithms.riot.api.RiotApi;\nimport net.rithms.riot.api.RiotApiException;\nimport net.rithms.riot.api.endpoints.match.dto.MatchList;\nimport net.rithms.riot.api.endpoints.match.dto.MatchReference;\nimport net.rithms.riot.api.endpoints.summoner.dto.Summoner;\nimport net.rithms.riot.constant.Platform;\n\n/**\n * This example demonstrates using the RiotApi to request the match list for a given summoner name and iterating over the match list\n */\npublic class MatchListExample {\n\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) throws RiotApiException {\n\t\tApiConfig config = new ApiConfig().setKey(\"YOUR-API-KEY-HERE\");\n\t\tRiotApi api = new RiotApi(config);\n\n\t\t// First we need to request the summoner because we will need it's account ID\n\t\tSummoner summoner = api.getSummonerByName(Platform.NA, \"tryndamere\");\n\n\t\t// Then we can use the account ID to request the summoner's match list\n\t\tMatchList matchList = api.getMatchListByAccountId(Platform.NA, summoner.getAccountId());\n\n\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Total Games in requested match list: \" + matchList.getTotalGames());\n\n\t\t// We can now iterate over the match list to access the data\n\t\tif (matchList.getMatches() != null) {\n\t\t\tfor (MatchReference match : matchList.getMatches()) {\n\t\t\t\tSystem.out.println(\"GameID: \" + match.getGameId());\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nYou can find these and more examples in the repository's directory \"examples\".\n\n## Documentation\nThe documentation for this library can be found [here.](http://taycaldwell.com/riot-api-java/doc/)\n\n## API Versions\nThe current version of this library supports the following Riot Games API versions:\n- **CHAMPION-MASTERY-V4**\n- **CHAMPION-V3**\n- **LEAGUE-V4**\n- **LOL-STATUS-V3**\n- **MATCH-V4**\n- **SPECTATOR-V4**\n- **STATIC-DATA-V3** (deprecated)\n- **SUMMONER-V4**\n- **THIRD-PARTY-CODE-V4**\n- **TOURNAMENT-V3**\n- **TOURNAMENT-STUB-V4**\n\n## Contributing\nAll contributions are appreciated.\nIf you would like to contribute to this project, please send a pull request.\n\n## Contact\nHave a suggestion, complaint, or question?

This is still very experimental in both MO2 and Wabbajack.\n\nSome like Mechwarrior 5 use a complete new method of creating a list found [here](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/wiki/Native-Game-Installer---(Installers-not-using-MO2)), for more info on that best join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack) for guidance.\n\n## Installing a Modlist\n\nEvery Modlist comes with its own README containing information and instructions on how to install it correctly. You should definitely read the Modlist specific README if you want a successful installation.\n\nThe general procedure is download the Modlist which comes as a `.wabbajack` file, opening Wabbajack, clicking on the _Install From Disk_ button, configuring Install and Download Location and hitting start.\n\nDo note that installation can take anything from a few minutes to hours depending on the size of the Modlist, your Internet connection as well as your hardware. In the meantime you can take a look at some of the included mods of the Modlist in the Slideshow that is playing during installation.\n\n## Creating your own Modlist\n\nModlist Creation or Compilation as we call it, is a trial and error process. You will likely get a decent amount of compilation errors in the beginning and have to spent some time fixing them before your first compilation succeeds. After that you can do incremental builds which take significantly less time and have close to zero errors compared to your first build.\n\n### Requirements\n\nWabbajack requires that you created your Modlist using a **portable** version of Mod Organizer 2. This is a **hard requirement** and Wabbajack won't work with Vortex, Kortex, Wyre Bash, Nexus Mod Manager, Oblivion Mod Manager or any other Mod Manager, not even Mod Organizer 1.\n\nAside from needed a portable MO2 installation you need to have a specific setup and workflow when modding, see [Pre-Compilation](#pre-compilation) for more information about that.\n\n### Pre-Compilation\n\nCompilation itself is similar to Installation as you just configure some paths and start the process, sit back and wait for Wabbajack to finish. Wabbajack requires a rather specific MO2 setup and you might have to change your workflow when modding for a WJ Modlist.\n\n#### Everything comes from somewhere\n\n> Wabbajack is an automated Modlist Installer that can reproduce an entire modding setup on another machine without bundling any assets or re-distributing any mods.\n\nThe focus is on _without bundling any assets or re-distributing any mods_. This means that Wabbajack needs to know where **every single file** came from. The most common origin is your downloads folder.\n\nIf you take a quick look inside your MO2 downloads folder you will find 2 types of files:\n\n1) The actual download (some archive)\n2) A `.meta` file that has the same name the archive its for\n\nYou might have `SkyUI_5_1-3863-5-1.7z` and `SkyUI_5_1-3863-5-1.7z.meta`.\n\nThese `.meta` files are created by MO2 and typically get created when you click the _MOD MANAGER DOWNLOAD_ button on Nexus Mods. If you open the `.meta` file you will find some metadata for the accompanied archive, the most important entries being `fileID`, `modID` and `gameName`.\n\nWabbajack will use the MO2 `.meta` files to find out where the archive came from using the [Nexus Mods API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/NexusMods/nexus-mods_public_api_params_in_form_data/1.0#/). This means that you **should** use the _MOD MANAGER DOWNLOAD_ button on Nexus Mods or you have to create those `.meta` files yourself (you can also use the _Query Info_ context menu option in the MO2 Downloads tab. This will populate the metadata of the selected archive).\n\nFor more information about `.meta` files, support sites and how to actually create them, see the [Meta File](#meta-files) section.\n\n#### Script Extender and Cleaned Masters\n\nThe first step for modding a Bethesda game: Download the game, install the Script Extender and clean base game master files (`.esms`). Wabbajack can, of course, automate these steps.\n\n_(You should use MO2s virtual file system for SKSE Scripts, it is not recommended to install the SKSE Scripts into the game folder directly)_.\n\nWabbajack can match files from your game folder with your downloads folder (more in-depth info on that topic: [Game Folder Files and MO2](#game-folder-files-and-mo2)), this means you download the Script Extender to your MO2 downloads folder and create a `.meta` file for it. The meta file should look something like this:\n\n```ini\n[General]\ndirectURL=http://skse.silverlock.org/beta/skse64_2_00_18.7z\n```\n\nIn the example above we used [SKSE SE 2.0.18](http://skse.silverlock.org/) and you'd have to replace the URL with the direct download link of the Script Extender you are using.\n\nNext up are Cleaned Master Files. Use xEdit through MO2 and clean the base game master files normally, copy the cleaned master files to a new mod in MO2 (called `Cleaned Master Files` or something) and replace the cleaned master files in your game folder with the backup created by xEdit to revert them to their default unmodified state.\n\n#### Game Folder Files and MO2\n\nYou now know about `.meta` files and understand that every file has to come from somewhere, this also means that you also need to create `.meta` files for MO2 and files in your game folder. We recommend using the [MO2 GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer/releases/) instead of the ones you find on the Nexus.\n\nMods that need to be installed to the game folder by the user are required to be installed to a `Game Folder Files` folder in your MO2 directory. Let's look at an example for better understanding:\n\nYou will likely make use of SKSE/F4SE/OBSE or other Script Extender if you are modding Bethesda titles. Eg for SKSE you'd need to install `skse64_1_5_97.dll`, `skse64_loader.exe` and `skse64_steam_loader.dll` to your game folder. To make things easier for the end user, you can should put those files inside the `Game Folder Files` folder at `MO2\\Game Folder Files`. You also need the archive and it's `.meta` file (see [Script Extender and Cleaned ESMs](#script-extender-and-cleaned-masters) section if you haven't) in your downloads folder so Wabbajack can match those files.\n\nThe user then only has to copy the files from the `Game Folder Files` directory to their game folder after installation. This also works for other files that need to be installed directly to the game folder like ENB or ReShade.\n\n#### Stock Game\n\nAs an alternative to Game Folder Files, you may instead utilize the [Stock Game](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/wiki/Keeping-The-Game-Folder-Clean-(via-local-game-installs)) feature. Stock Game is a folder within the MO2 instance folder that contains the base game files necessary to run a list, including any files you need to add to it such as `skse64_loader.exe`. Stock Game eliminates the need for the user to copy `Game Folder Files` into their game's installation directory and keeps the final installed list separate from the game's installation directory. Additionally, this allows a list author fine control over what files are included by default in the game's installation, such as SKSE, ENB, and so on. \n\nNote that Stock Game has one downside: When using Stock Game, Wabbajack will expect the game to come from a single source and *only* a single source (Steam, GOG, etc.). As an example: Morrowind is available on GOG, Steam, and Beth.net. When utilizing Stock Game with a copy of Morrowind from Steam, Wabbajack will expect all users who install the list to have the game through Steam, effectively excluding users who have purchased the game from GOG or Beth.net. Because of this, it is recommended that Stock Game only be utilized with games that have a single source, such as Skyrim SE which is only available through Steam.\n\nDetailed setup information for Stock Game on Skyrim SE can be found [here.](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/main/lessons/Setting%20up%20Stock%20Game%20for%20Skyrim%20SE.md)\n\n#### Special Flags\n\nThere are some special cases where you want to change the default Wabbajack behavior for a specific mod. You can place the following flags in the notes or comments section of a mod to change how Wabbajack handles that mod.\n\n| Flag | Description | Notes |\n|------|-------------|-------|\n| `WABBAJACK_INCLUDE` | All mod files will be inlined into the `.wabbajack` file | **DO NOT USE ON DOWNLOADED MODS** As it would result in you distributing that mod. Can lead to large `.wabbajack` files if used unsparingly |\n| `WABBAJACK_NOMATCH_INCLUDE` | Any unmatched files will be inlined into the `.wabbajack` file | Useful for custom patches or generated files |\n| `WABBAJACK_ALWAYS_ENABLE` | The mod will not be ignored by Wabbajack even if it's disabled | Wabbajack will normally ignore all mods you disabled in MO2 but there are some cases where you might want to give some choice to the end user and want to have the mod included |\n| `WABBAJACK_ALWAYS_DISABLE` | The mod will always be ignored by Wabbajack | Useful if you don't want some mods included in the Modlist but still want to keep it active in your own setup |\n\n#### Tagfile Tags\n\nYou can create an empty `tagfile` with no extention in any folder you want to apply this tags to. This is meant to be used with folders that aren't mods.\n\n| Flag/File | Description | Notes |\n|------|-------------|-------|\n| `WABBAJACK_INCLUDE` | All files in this folder will be inlined into the `.wabbajack` file | **DO NOT USE ON DOWNLOADED MODS** As it would result in you distributing that mod. Can lead to large `.wabbajack` files if used unsparingly |\n| `WABBAJACK_NOMATCH_INCLUDE` | Any unmatched files will be inlined into the `.wabbajack` file | Useful for custom patches or generated files |\n| `WABBAJACK_IGNORE` | All files in this folder will be ignored by Wabbajack and therefore not be put into into the `.wabbajack` file. | Useful for tools or other things outside a mod you don't want/need reproduced on a users machine. Handle with care since excluded stuff can potentially break a setup.\\* |\n| `WABBAJACK_INCLUDE_SAVES` | When this file exists Wabbajack will include your save files in the `.wabbajack` file.| This will remove previous savefiles when the list gets installed as an update. |\n| `WABBAJACK_NOMATCH_INCLUDE_FILES.txt` | All files listed in this file will be included in the `.wabbajack` file. | Every file needs to be in the same folder as the tag file. Every file need to be written into a new line. Every file needs to be added with its file extension.|\n| `WABBAJACK_IGNORE_FILES.txt` | All files listed in this file will be ignored by Wabbajack and not included in the `.wabbajack` file. | Every file needs to be in the same folder as the tag file. Every file need to be written into a new line. Every file needs to be added with its file extension.|\n\n\\*It will finish the installation of a modlist, but the installed list might not run if you excluded a crutial part of it.\n\n#### Patches\n\nReading all the previous section you might wonder if Wabbajack is able to detect modified files and how it deals with them. Wabbajack can't include the modified file so instead we just include the difference between the original and modified version.\n\nThis basically means `original + patch = final` and we only include `patch` in the `.wabbajack` file which, by itself, is just gibberish and completely useless without the original file. This allows us to distribute arbitrary changes without violating copyrights as we do not copy copyrighted material. Instead, we copy instructions on how to modify the copyrighted material.\n\nYou don't even have to tell Wabbajack that a specific file was modified, that would be way too much work. Instead Wabbajack will figure out which file got modified and create a binary patch. The modified file can be anything from some modified settings file to a patched plugin or optimized mesh/texture.\n\n#### BSA Decomposition\n\nWabbajack is able to analyse `.bsa` and `.ba2` files and can also create those. This means that any changes made to a BSA/BA2 are copied on the end-user's installation, including the creation of new BSAs or the modification of existing ones. Unpacking, modifying, and then repacking a BSA is possible and those modifications will carry over to the final install. Similarly, creation of new BSAs will be replicated. Wabbajack does not analyze the BSA as a whole - instead it will look inside the BSA, hash the files within, and compare those to their original sources. It will then construct the BSA if new or reconstruct it if modified as necessary. Note that with particularly large BSAs this building and rebuilding process can take a significant amount of time on the user's machine depending on the user's hardware specifications.\n\n#### Merges\n\nSimilar to BSAs, Wabbajack is able to analyze and create merged mods. Wabbajack will source the necessary files to create the merge from aforementioned sources of mods and then rebuild the merge on the user's end. Generally it is recommended to tag merges with the `WABBAJACK_NOMATCH_INCLUDE` flag to ensure that any files generated by the merging process are also carried over to the user. Wabbajack does not by default include the files and information necessary to build or rebuild the merge in the program used to build the merge originally, only the merge itself will be installed. \n\n#### Multiple MO2 Profiles\n\nWabbajack will normally ignore every other profile but you might have more than one profile that should be included. In this case you can create a `otherprofiles.txt` file in your main profile folder and write the names of the other profiles (1 per line) in it.\n\n**Example**:\n\nProfiles: `SFW`, `NSFW` (`SFW` is the main profile)\n\ncontents of `MO2\\profiles\\SFW\\otherprofiles.txt`:\n\n```txt\nNSFW\n```\n\n#### Minimal Downloads Folder\n\nWe already talked about how Wabbajack will _match_ files to determine where they came from. This can sometimes not work as intended and Wabbajack might end up matching files against the wrong archive. This can happen when you have multiple versions of the same mod in your downloads folder. It is highly recommended that you **delete unused downloads and previous versions of mods** so that Wabbajack doesn't end up mis-matching files and the end user ends up downloading more than they need.\n\n### Compilation\n\nCompilation itself is very straight forward and similar to Installation: you let Wabbajack run and hope it finishes successfully. The key for making it run successfully is having a \"Wabbajack-compliant\" MO2 setup which you can get by following the advice from the previous sections.\n\nFor a more detailed guide on executing the compilation process, refer to [this document.](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/main/lessons/Compiling%20a%20Modlist%20for%20Wabbajack.md)\n\n#### Wabbajack Compilation Configuration\n\nIn Wabbajack select _Create a Modlist_ to navigate to the configuration screen. Here you can configure some metadata for your Modlist which will later be viewable by the user.\n\n| Field | Description | Notes |\n|-------|-------------|-------|\n| Modlist Name | **REQUIRED:** Name of your Modlist | |\n| Version | **REQUIRED:** Current Version | Do note that this has to be a semantic version (1.0 or 0.1 (it can have multiple `.` separators)) and not some random text like \"The best version on Earth\" (this is not the Nexus)! |\n| Author | Modlist Author | Should be your name in original Modlists and/or the name of the original Modlist author if you adapted a normal Modlist to a Wabbajack Modlist |\n| Description | 700 characters Descriptions | |\n| Image | Modlist Image | Aspect ratio should be 16:9 for the best result |\n| Website | Website URL | |\n| Readme | Readme URL | |\n| NSFW | NSFW Checkbox | Only really needed for official Modlists as our Galleries have the option to hide NSFW Modlists |\n\n#### Compilation Errors\n\nYou will likely get a ton of errors during your first compilation which is to be expected. We highly recommend you join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack) and check the `modlist-development-help` channel for help.\n\n### Post-Compilation\n\nAfter you have finished the Compilation you are basically done with Wabbajack and can upload the resulting `.wabbajack` file to somewhere, share it with people or just keep it for yourself as a Modlist backup. This section is for people who want to share their Modlist with the community.\n\nIn the Wabbajack community we differentiate between _official_ and _unofficial_ Modlists. The former being curated Modlists which have been tested and are available in the Wabbajack Gallery while the latter are Modlists submitted on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack) in the `unofficial-modlist-submissions` channel and are not tested.\n\nOfficial Modlists also get their own support channel on our Discord and often have 500-2500 users depending on the game. Do note that these Modlists receive regular updates and the authors are putting in a lot of hours to deliver the best possible version. If you think your Modlist and more importantly: yourself are up for the task you can submit your Modlist for official status on the Discord in the `modlist-development-info` channel.\n\nManaging a Modlist can be tricky if you have never done something like this. In the early days of Wabbajack we mostly relied on GDocs READMEs and hosted all accompanying files on GDrive while managing issues through the support channel on Discord. This system was later almost completely replaced through valiant effort by one of our developers: almost all new Modlists use GitHub for managing their Modlist.\n\nGitHub was made for developers and is the site you are currently on. It mostly hosts source code for open source projects, such as Wabbajack, but can also be used for project management. Another strong point is Markdown support. This README you are currently reading is, like every other GitHub README, written in Markdown and rendered on GitHub.\n\nOn the topic of READMEs: you should create a good one.\n\nIt is not sufficient to just slap some install and MCM instructions in there. Your Modlist might contain a thousand mods and offer hundreds of playtime but the user might not know what in oblivion is even going on and what's included.\n\nExample structure for a good README:\n\n- **Preamble**: Give a quick overview about what your Modlist is about, the core idea and also mention that it's a Wabbajack Modlist (some might not know what Wabbajack is so link to this README)\n- **Requirements**: Simple list of requirements such as min CPU, GPU, RAM and most importantly: Drive Space. Also include a list of accounts the user needs such as a Nexus Mods, LoversLab, VectorPlexus Account or any other sites your are downloading from\n- **Installation**: Installation instructions specific to your Modlist. You can take a look at some of the Modlists linked below as almost all of them use the same instructions with minor changes\n- **Important Mods you should know about**: This is an important section you should not forget. Go in-depth on core mods and talk about _important mods the user should know about_. It can be overwhelming for the user to just be thrusted into a completely modded world without knowing what's even included and possible.\n- **MCM**: If your Modlist has some sort of MCM like for Skyrim or Fallout 4 then you should give instructions on what settings to use\n- **Changelog**: Should not be in the README and can be in a separate file called `CHANGELOG.md` but make sure to create one\n\nSome Modlists that host all their stuff on GitHub:\n\n- the OG GitHub Modlist: [Lotus](https://github.com/erri120/lotus)\n- [Keizaal](https://github.com/PierreDespereaux/Keizaal)\n- [Elder Souls](https://github.com/jdsmith2816/eldersouls)\n- [Total Visual Overhaul](https://github.com/NotTotal/Total-Visual-Overhaul)\n- [Serenity](https://github.com/ixanza/serenity)\n- [RGE](https://github.com/jdsmith2816/rge)\n- [Elysium](https://github.com/TitansBane/Elysium)\n\nOther modlists opt to host all of their information on a dedicated website:\n- [The Phoenix Flavour](https://thephoenixflavour.com)\n- [Living Skyrim](https://www.fgsmodlists.com/living-skyrim)\n- [MOISE](https://www.fgsmodlists.com/moise)\n- [Dungeons & Deviousness](https://www.fgsmodlists.com/dd)\n- [Tales From the Northern Lands](https://eziothedeadpoet.github.io/Tales-from-the-Northern-Lands/)\n\n### Meta Files\n\n_Read [Everything comes from somewhere](#everything-comes-from-somewhere) first, as that section explains the basic concept of meta files. This section focuses more on advanced uses._\n\nYou already know how `.meta` files should look for mods that come from Nexus Mods:\n\n```ini\n[General]\ngameName=Skyrim\nmodID=3863\nfileID=1000172397\n```\n\nThis is the basic configuration for an archive that came from Nexus Mods. You can get these types of `.meta` files through MO2 by using the _Query Info_ option in the Downloads tab.\n\nMods can also be hosted somewhere else, eg on other modding sites like LoversLab, ModDB or normal file hosting services like GDrive and MEGA. Below is a table for all supported sites that Wabbajack can download from.\n\n**Additional notes**:\n\n- Every `.meta` file, no matter the site, has to start with `[General]`\n- `.meta` files are **case sensitive** (see [Issue `#480`](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/issues/480) for more info, this will be fixed somewhere in the future)\n- The \"Whitelist\" Wabbajack uses is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/opt-out-lists/blob/master/ServerWhitelist.yml) and you might have to create a Pull Request if you want to add a link\n- For IPS4 Sites: IPS4 sites have a common layout and all behave very similar. There are some minor differences because they use different template versions but in general the same layout applies to all of them. Here are the different download links you can have for IPS4 sites:\n  - Multi-file download: `{SITE-PREFIX}/files/file/{FILE}/?do=download&r={ID}&confirm=1&t=1`\n  - Single-file download: `{SITE-PREFIX}/files/file/{FILE}/`\n  - Attachments: `{SITE-PREFIX}/applications/core/interface/file/attachment.php?id={ID}`\n\n| Site | Requires Login | Requires Whitelist Entry | Meta File Layout | Example | Notes |\n|------|----------------|--------------------------|------------------|---------|-------|\n| [LoversLab](https://www.loverslab.com/) | Yes | No | IPS4 Site Prefix: `https://www.loverslab.com` | `directURL=https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/11116-test-file-for-wabbajack-integration/?do=download&r=737123&confirm=1&t=1` | IPS4 Site, mostly multi-file downloads |\n| [VectorPlexus](https://vectorplexus.com/) | Yes | No | IPS4 Site Prefix: `https://vectorplexus.com` | `directURL=https://vectorplexus.com/files/file/290-wabbajack-test-file` | IPS4 Site, mostly multi-file downloads |\n| [TES Alliance](http://tesalliance.org/) | Yes | No | IPS4 Site Prefix: `http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?` | `directURL=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/2035-wabbajack-test-file/` | IPS4 Site, mostly single-file downloads |\n| [TESAll](https://tesall.ru) | Yes | No | IPS4 Site Prefix: `https://tesall.ru` | `directURL=https://tesall.ru/files/getdownload/594545-wabbajack-test-file/` | IPS4 Site, mostly single-file downloads |\n| [ModDB](https://www.moddb.com/) | No | No | `directURL=https://www.moddb.com/downloads/start/{ID}` | `https://www.moddb.com/downloads/start/124908` | Downloads can be very slow |\n| [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) | No | Yes | `directURL=https://www.patreon.com/file?h={ID1}i={ID2}` | `directURL=https://www.patreon.com/file?h=34874668&i=5247431` | Only public downloads, paywalled downloads can not be downloaded |\n| [GitHub](https://github.com/) | No | No | `directURL=https://github.com/{USER}/{REPO}/releases/download/{TAG}/{FILE}` | `directURL=https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer/releases/download/v2.3.1/Mod.Organizer-2.3.1.7z` | |\n| [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) | No | Yes | `directURL=https://drive.google.com/file/d/{ID}` | `directURL=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1grLRTrpHxlg7VPxATTFNfq2OkU_Plvh_/` | Google Drive is known to not be a reliable file hosting service as a file can get temporarily inaccessible if too many users try to download it |\n| [MEGA](https://mega.nz/) | No (Optional) | Yes | `directURL=https://mega.nz/#!{ID}` | `directURL=https://mega.nz/#!CsMSFaaJ!-uziC4mbJPRy2e4pPk8Gjb3oDT_38Be9fzZ6Ld4NL-k` | MEGA has a 5GB transfer quota on non-premium users, even less for non-registered ones.

Sadly development was moving a bit too slowly for my liking, and I realized that a complete rewrite would allow the implementation of some really nice features (like BSA packing). As such I made the decision to strike out on my own and make an app that worked first, and then make it pretty. The end result is an app with a ton of features, and a less than professional UI. But that's my motto when coding \"_make it work, then make it pretty_\".\n\n**Can I charge for a Wabbajack Modlist I created?**\n\nNo, as specified in the [License](#license--copyright), Wabbajack Modlists must be available for free. Any payment in exchange for access to a Wabbajack installer is strictly prohibited. This includes paywalling, \"pay for beta access\", \"pay for current version, previous version is free\", or any sort of other quid-pro-quo monetization structure. The Wabbajack team reserves the right to implement software that will prohibit the installation of any lists that are paywalled.\n\n**Can I accept donations for my installer?**\n\nAbsolutely! As long as the act of donating does not entitle the donator to access to the installer. The installer must be free, donations must be a \"thank you\" - not a purchase of services or content.\n\n### For Mod Authors\n\n**How does Wabbajack download mods from the Nexus?**\n\nWabbajack uses the official [Nexus API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/NexusMods/nexus-mods_public_api_params_in_form_data/1.0#/) to retrieve download links from the Nexus. Mod Managers such as MO2 or Vortex also use this API to download files. Downloading using the API is the same as downloading directly from the website, both will increase your download count and give you donation points.\n\n**How can I opt out of having my mod be included in a Modlist?**\n\nAs explained before:\n\n> We use the official [Nexus API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/NexusMods/nexus-mods_public_api_params_in_form_data/1.0#/) to retrieve download links from the Nexus.\n\nEveryone who has access to the Nexus can download your mod. The Nexus does not and can not lock out Wabbajack from using the API to download a specific mod based on _author preferences_.\n\n**Will the end user even know they use my mod?**\n\nYour mod is exposed in several layers of the user experience when installing a Modlist. Before the installation even starts, the user has access to the manifest of the Modlist. This contains a list of all mods to be installed as well as the authors, version, size, links and more meta data depending on origin.\n\nWabbajack will start a Slideshow during installation which features all mods to be installed in random order. The Slideshow displays the title, author, main image, description, version and a link to the Nexus page.\n\nAfter installation the user most likely needs to check the instructions of the Modlist for recommended MCM options. If your mod has an MCM and needs a lot of configuring than your mod will likely be featured in the instructions.\n\nSome Modlists also have an extensive README and we highly encourage new Modlist Authors to add a section about important mods to their README (see [Post-Compilation](#post-compilation)).\n\n**What if my mod is not on the Nexus?**\n\nYou can check all sites we can download from [here](#meta-files) and we can easily add support for other sites. As long as your mod is publicly accessible and available on the Internet, Wabbajack can probably download it. Even if the site requires a login and does not have an API, we can always just resort to our internal browser and download the mod as if a user would go to the website using Firefox/Chrome and click the download button.\n\n## License & Copyright\n\nAll original code in Wabbajack is given freely via the [GPL3 license](LICENSE.txt). Parts of Wabbajack use libraries that carry their own Open Sources licenses, those parts retain their original copyrights. Selling of Modlist files is strictly forbidden. As is hosting the files behind any sort of paywall. You received this tool free of charge, respect this by giving freely as you were given.\n\n## Contributing\n\nLook at the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/halgari/wabbajack/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed guidelines.\n\n## Thanks to\n\nOur testers and Discord members who encourage development and help test the builds.\n"

Write a little bit of Ruby, define your deck's stats, then compile your game into a series of images ready for print-and-play or even print-on-demand. Squib is very data-driven and built on the principle of Don't Repeat Yourself. Think of it like [nanDeck](http://www.nand.it/nandeck/) done \"the Ruby way\". Squib supports:\n\n* A concise set of rules for laying out your cards\n* Loading PNGs and SVGs\n* Complex text rendering using [Pango](http://www.pango.org/)\n* Reading `xlsx` and `csv` files\n* Rendering to PNGs, PDFs, and SVGs (sheets or individual files)\n* Flexible, data-driven layouts in Yaml\n* Basic shape drawing, blending operators, gradients, etc.\n* Unit conversion\n* The full power of Ruby!\n\nSquib is based on the [Cairo](http://cairographics.org/) graphics rendering engine, the library of choice for WebKit, Gecko, Inkscape and many, many others.\n\nCheck this out.\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'squib'\n\nSquib::Deck.new(cards: 2) do\n  text str: %w(Hello World!)\n  save_png\nend\n```\n\nWe just created a 2-card deck with \"Hello\" on the first card, and \"World\" on the second, and saved them out to PNGs.\n\nWanna see more? Check out the website: http://andymeneely.github.io/squib/\n\n## Installation\n\nSquib requires Ruby 2.7 or later.\n\nInstall it yourself with:\n\n    $ gem install squib\n\nIf you're using Bundler, add this line to your application's Gemfile:\n\n    gem 'squib'\n\nAnd then execute:\n\n    $ bundle\n\nMore info: http://squib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nAfter installing Squib, you can create a project and run your first build like this:\n\n```sh\n$ squib new my-cool-game\n$ cd my-cool-game\n$ ruby deck.rb\n```\n\nThe `squib new` command will generate files and folders like this:\n\n```\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 .gitignore\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 ABOUT.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Gemfile\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 IDEAS.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 PLAYTESTING.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 PNP NOTES.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 RULES.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Rakefile\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 _output\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 gitkeep.txt\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 config.yml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 deck.rb\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 layout.yml\n\n12 files\n```\n\n\n# Learning Squib\n\nGo [read the docs!](http://squib.readthedocs.org/)\n\nAlso:\n* The `samples` directory in the [source repository](https://github.com/andymeneely/squib) has lots of examples.\n* [Masters of the Heist](http://mastersoftheheist.com) is my own creation, and it was made with Squib. Go through the repository and watch how it evolved!\n* [Junk Land](https://github.com/andymeneely/junk-land) is my own creation that's uses Squib for full-color rendering, and makes use of Ruby in a lot of interesting ways. The port is still in process.\n* [Project Spider Monkey](https://github.com/andymeneely/project-spider-monkey) is another of my own creations. This one was started from scratch with Squib, but it's still in its early stages.\n\n\n## Staying DRY\n\nSquib tries to keep you DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) with the following features:\n\n* Custom layouts allow you to specify various arguments in a separate file. This is great for x-y coordinates and alignment properties that would otherwise clutter up perfectly readable code. Squib goes even further and has a special \"extends\" that works especially well for grouped-together styles.\n* Flexible ranges and array handling: the `range` parameter in Squib is very flexible, meaning that one `text` command can specify different text in different fonts, styles, colors, etc. for each card. If you find yourself doing multiple `text` command for the same field across different ranges of cards, there's probably a better way to condense.\n* Custom colors keep you from hardcoding magic color strings everywhere. Custom colors go into `config.yml` file.\n* Plus, you know, Ruby.\n\n\n## Docker\n\nWant to run in a controlled environment? We've got a [Docker image on DockerHub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/andymeneely/repository/docker/andymeneely/squib)\n\nHere's one way to run it. On the command line, go to the root of your repository. With these commands, we'll map the current directory to the `/usr/src/app` directory in the Docker image. When squib-in-docker read & writes files from there, it'll write it back out to your current directory.\n\nAssuming you have a script called hello.rb:\n\nOn Windows:\n\n```\ndocker run --rm -v \"%cd%\":/usr/src/app andymeneely/squib ruby hello.rb\n```\n\nOn Macs:\n\n```\ndocker run --rm -v \"$PWD\":/usr/src/app andymeneely/squib ruby hello.rb\n```\n\nThis will create a folder called `_output` in your current directory and write the output of the script there.\n\nWe're still working on ways to customize your own Docker build (e.g. document building, custom fonts, etc.) with your own Dockerfile. Pull requests and ideas welcome!\n\n\n# Get Help and Give Help\n\nSee [this page](http://squib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/help.html)\n\n\n# What's up the with the name?\n\nTruthfully, I just thought it was a cool, simple word that was not used much in the Ruby community nor the board game community. But, now that I've committed to the name, I've realized that:\n\n* Squibs are small explosive devices, much like Squib \"explodes\" your rules into a playable game\n* Squibs are often used in heist movies, leading to a sudden plot twist that often resembles the twists of good tabletop game\n* Squibs are also part of the Harry Potter world - they are people who are non-magical but wizard-born. Squib is aware of wizarding magic and comes from that heritage, but it's not magical itself.\n"

Use the [PyBullet forums](http://pybullet.org) to discuss with others.\n\n## PyBullet ##\nIt is highly recommended to use PyBullet Python bindings for improved support for robotics, reinforcement learning and VR. Use pip install pybullet and checkout the [PyBullet Quickstart Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10sXEhzFRSnvFcl3XxNGhnD4N2SedqwdAvK3dsihxVUA/edit#heading=h.2ye70wns7io3).\n\nInstallation is simple:\n```\npip3 install pybullet --upgrade --user\npython3 -m pybullet_envs.examples.enjoy_TF_AntBulletEnv_v0_2017may\npython3 -m pybullet_envs.examples.enjoy_TF_HumanoidFlagrunHarderBulletEnv_v1_2017jul\npython3 -m pybullet_envs.deep_mimic.testrl --arg_file run_humanoid3d_backflip_args.txt\n```\n\nIf you use PyBullet in your research, please cite it like this:\n\n```\n@MISC{coumans2021,\nauthor =   {Erwin Coumans and Yunfei Bai},\ntitle =    {PyBullet, a Python module for physics simulation for games, robotics and machine learning},\nhowpublished = {\\url{http://pybullet.org}},\nyear = {2016--2021}\n}\n```\n\n## Requirements for Bullet Physics C++\n\nA C++ compiler for C++ 2003. The library is tested on Windows, Linux, Mac OSX, iOS, Android,\nbut should likely work on any platform with C++ compiler. \nSome optional demos require OpenGL 2 or OpenGL 3, there are some non-graphical demos and unit tests too.\n\n## Contributors and Coding Style information\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1u9vyzPtrVoVhYqQOGNWUgjRbfwfCdIts_NzmvgiJ144/edit\n\n## Requirements for experimental OpenCL GPGPU support\n\nThe entire collision detection and rigid body dynamics can be executed on the GPU.\n\nA high-end desktop GPU, such as an AMD Radeon 7970 or NVIDIA GTX 680 or better.\nWe succesfully tested the software under Windows, Linux and Mac OSX.\nThe software currently doesn't work on OpenCL CPU devices. It might run\non a laptop GPU but performance will not likely be very good. Note that\noften an OpenCL drivers fails to compile a kernel. Some unit tests exist to\ntrack down the issue, but more work is required to cover all OpenCL kernels.\n\n## License\n\nAll source code files are licensed under the permissive zlib license\n(http://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib) unless marked differently in a particular folder/file.\n\n## Build instructions for Bullet using vcpkg\n\nYou can download and install Bullet using the [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/) dependency manager:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git\n    cd vcpkg\n    ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh\n    ./vcpkg integrate install\n    ./vcpkg install bullet3\n\nThe Bullet port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors. If the version is out of date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on the vcpkg repository.\n\n## Build instructions for Bullet using premake. You can also use cmake instead.\n\n**Windows**\n\nClick on build_visual_studio_vr_pybullet_double.bat and open build3/vs2010/0_Bullet3Solution.sln\nWhen asked, convert the projects to a newer version of Visual Studio.\nIf you installed Python in the C:\\ root directory, the batch file should find it automatically.\nOtherwise, edit this batch file to choose where Python include/lib directories are located.\n\n**Windows Virtual Reality sandbox for HTC Vive and Oculus Rift**\n\nBuild and run the App_SharedMemoryPhysics_VR project, preferably in Release/optimized build.\nYou can connect from Python pybullet to the sandbox using:\n\n```\nimport pybullet as p\np.connect(p.SHARED_MEMORY) #or (p.TCP, \"localhost\", 6667) or (p.UDP, \"192.168.86.10\",1234)\n```\n\n**Linux and Mac OSX gnu make**\n\nMake sure cmake is installed (sudo apt-get install cmake, brew install cmake, or https://cmake.org)\n\nIn a terminal type:\n```\n./build_cmake_pybullet_double.sh\n```\nThis script will invoke cmake and build in the build_cmake directory. You can find pybullet in Bullet/examples/pybullet.\nThe BulletExampleBrowser binary will be in Bullet/examples/ExampleBrowser.\n\nYou can also build Bullet using premake. There are premake executables in the build3 folder.\nDepending on your system (Linux 32bit, 64bit or Mac OSX) use one of the following lines\nUsing premake:\n```\ncd build3\n./premake4_linux --double gmake\n./premake4_linux64 --double gmake\n./premake4_osx --double --enable_pybullet gmake\n```\nThen\n```\ncd gmake\nmake\n```\n\nNote that on Linux, you need to use cmake to build pybullet, since the compiler has issues of mixing shared and static libraries.\n\n**Mac OSX Xcode**\n\t\nClick on build3/xcode4.command or in a terminal window execute\n```\t\n./premake_osx xcode4\n```\n## Usage\n\nThe App_ExampleBrowser executables will be located in the bin folder.\nYou can just run it though a terminal/command prompt, or by clicking it.\n\n\n```\n[--start_demo_name=\"Demo Name\"]     Start with a selected demo  \n[--mp4=moviename.mp4]               Create a mp4 movie of the window, requires ffmpeg installed\n[--mouse_move_multiplier=0.400000]  Set the mouse move sensitivity\n[--mouse_wheel_multiplier=0.01]     Set the mouse wheel sensitivity\n[--background_color_red= 0.9]       Set the red component for background color. Same for green and blue\n[--fixed_timestep= 0.0]             Use either a real-time delta time (0.0) or a fixed step size (0.016666)\n```\n\nYou can use mouse picking to grab objects. When holding the ALT or CONTROL key, you have Maya style camera mouse controls.\nPress F1 to create a series of screenshots. Hit ESCAPE to exit the demo app.\n\nCheck out the docs folder and the Bullet physics forums for further information.\n"

This model also allows any matchmaker to interact directly with Agones via the Kubernetes API to provision a dedicated game server.\n\nFor more details on why this project was written, read the\n[announcement blog post](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/03/introducing-Agones-open-source-multiplayer-dedicated-game-server-hosting-built-on-Kubernetes.html).\n\n## Major Features\n- Define a single `GameServer`, and/or large game server `Fleets` within Kubernetes - either through yaml or via the API\n- Manage GameServer lifecycles - including health checking and connection information.\n- `Fleet` Autoscaling capabilities that integrate with Kubernetes' native cluster autoscaling\n- Gameserver specific metric exports and dashboards for ops teams\n\n## Usage\n\nDocumentation can be found on the [Agones website](https://agones.dev/site/docs/).\n\n## Get involved\n\n- [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/agones/shared_invite/enQtMzE5NTE0NzkyOTk1LWU3ODAyZjdjMjNlYWIxZTAwODkxMGY3YWEyZjNjMjc4YWM1Zjk0OThlMGU2ZmUyMzRlMDljNDJiNmZlMGQ1M2U)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/agonesdev)\n- [Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/agones-discuss)\n- [Community Meetings](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhkWKwFGACw2dFpdmwxOyUCzlGP2-n7uF) (Join the mailing\n  list for details)\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nParticipation in this project comes under the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md)\n\n## Reporting Security Issues\n\nTo report a security issue for this project, please follow the instructions in\nthe [Project Security Policy](.github/SECURITY.md)\n\n## Development and Contribution\n\nPlease read the [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for directions on submitting Pull Requests to Agones, and community membership governance.\n\nSee the [Developing, Testing and Building Agones](build/README.md) documentation for developing, testing and building Agones from source.\n\nThe [Release Process](docs/governance/release_process.md) documentation displays the project's upcoming release calendar and release process.\n\nAgones is in active development - we would love your help in shaping its future!\n\n## This all sounds great, but can you explain Docker and/or Kubernetes to me?\n\n### Docker\n- [Docker's official \"Getting Started\" guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)\n- [Katacoda's free, interactive Docker course](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/docker)\n\n### Kubernetes\n- [You should totally read this comic, and interactive tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/kubernetes-comic/)\n- [Katacoda's free, interactive Kubernetes course](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/kubernetes)\n\n## Licence\n\nApache 2.0\n"

It can be used in Unity as well as in other .NET environments such as console applications.\n\nRiptide provides functionality for establishing connections and sending data back and forth, leaving it up to you to decide what data you want to send and when, which is ideal if you like to be in control of your code and know what's going on under the hood.\n\nRiptide is 100% free to use and only funded by [donations](https://github.com/sponsors/tom-weiland).\n\nFor a tutorial on how to set up Riptide in your project, see [this video](https://youtu.be/6kWNZOFcFQw).\n\n## Installation\n### Unity\nUsing Unity's Package Manager:\n1. Open the Package Manager (Window > Package Manager)\n2. Click the '+' (plus) button in the top left corner of the window\n3. Select the 'Add package from git URL...' option\n4. Enter the following base URL: `https://github.com/tom-weiland/RiptideNetworking.git?path=/UnityPackage#v1.2.0` and then append the version number you'd like to install. For example, if you want to install v1.2.0, you would enter `https://github.com/tom-weiland/RiptideNetworking.git?path=/UnityPackage#v1.2.0` as the full URL\n5. Click 'Add' and wait for Riptide to be installed\n\nAlternatively, you can grab the RiptideNetworking.dll file (and RiptideNetworking.xml file for intellisense documentation) from the [latest release](https://github.com/tom-weiland/RiptideNetworking/releases/latest) and simply drop it into your Unity project.\n\n### Other\nIf you aren't using Unity, you can add the RiptideNetworking.dll file to your project as a project reference:\n1. Download RiptideNetworking.dll file from the [latest release](https://github.com/tom-weiland/RiptideNetworking/releases/latest)\n2. Right click your project in Visual Studio's Solution Explorer\n3. Select 'Add' and then select the 'Project Reference...' option\n4. Click 'Browse' in the left sidebar of the window\n5. Click the 'Browse' button in the bottom right corner of the window\n6. Navigate to the folder where you saved the RiptideNetworking.dll file and add it\n\n## Getting Started\nFor a tutorial on how to set up Riptide in your project, see [this video](https://youtu.be/6kWNZOFcFQw).\n\n### Project Considerations\nIf you are making a player-hosted game (sometimes mistakenly referred to as \"peer-to-peer\") where one player acts as the server, you'll want all your code in a single project.\n\nHowever, if you intend to build a standalone server, having separate projects for the server and client may be helpful.\n\nRiptide supports either of those (and more) architecture choices.\n\n### Initial Setup\nSet up a `NetworkManager` class like in the [Unity demo projects](Demos/Unity). To run your own logic when certain things happen, you can subscribe to the following events:\n- Server\n  - `ClientConnected` - invoked when a new client connects\n  - `MessageReceived` - invoked when a message is received from a client (useful if you need to run custom logic for _every_ message that is received)\n  - `ClientDisconnected` - invoked when a client disconnects\n- Client\n  - `Connected` - invoked when a connection to the server is established\n  - `ConnectionFailed` - invoked when a connection to the server fails to be established\n  - `MessageReceived` - invoked when a message is received from a client (useful if you need to run custom logic for _every_ message that is received)\n  - `Disconnected` - invoked when disconnected by the server\n  - `ClientConnected` - invoked when another client connects\n  - `ClientDisonnected` - invoked when another client disconnects\n\nAdditionally, you can set up a `MessageExtensions` class to extend the functionality of the `Message` class. This is helpful if you wish to send custom objects over the network\u2014being able to directly Add/Get a `Vector3` from a message is much more convenient than having to call the Add/GetFloat method 3 times in a row. Refer to the [Unity demos](Demos/Unity) for an example.\n\nNote that if you installed Riptide via the Unity package manager, `Message` extension methods for several types (including `Vector3` and `Quaternion`) are [already included](Unity/Packages/Core/Runtime/MessageExtensions.cs).\n\n### Creating and Sending Messages\nMessages are created like this:\n```cs\nMessage message = Message.Create(<messageSendMode>, <messageId>);\n```\n`<messageSendMode>` should be set to either `MessageSendMode.reliable` or `MessageSendMode.unreliable`, depending on how you want your message to be sent.<br/>\n`<messageId>` should be set to the message's ID (a `ushort`). This ID will allow the other end to determine how to handle the message upon receiving it.\n\nTo add data to your message, use:\n```cs\nmessage.Add(someValue);\n```\n`someValue` can be any of the following types (or an array of that type): `byte`, `bool`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, `float`, `double`, `string`\n\nAny custom types you may want to send usually consist of combinations of these primitive types. For example, a `Vector3` consists of 3 `float`s, so instead of literally sending the `Vector3` itself, you would send the x, y, and z, components as 3 separate `float`s (as mentioned above, you can extend the `Message` class to make this less cumbersome).\n\nTo send your message, use one of the following:\n```cs\nServer.Send(message, <toClientId>); // Sends message from server to 1 client\nServer.SendToAll(message); // Sends message from server to all clients\nServer.SendToAll(message, <toClientId>); // Sends message from server to all clients except one\nClient.Send(message); // Sends message from client to server\n```\n`<toClientId>` should be set to the ID (a `ushort`) of the client you want the server to send\u2014or not send, in the case of the SendToAll method\u2014the message to. \n\n### Handling Messages\nTo handle messages, simply create a static method and give it the MessageHandler attribute:\n```cs\n[MessageHandler(<someMessageFromServerID>)]\nprivate static void HandleSomeMessageFromServer(Message message)\n{\n    int someInt = message.GetInt();\n    bool someBool = message.GetBool();\n    float[] someFloats = message.GetFloats();\n    \n    // Do stuff with the retrieved data here\n}\n```\n`<someMessageFromServerID>` should be set to the ID (a `ushort`) of the message you want this method to handle.\n\nA few things to note:\n- to ensure that messages are actually handled, you _must_ regularly call the Tick method of the Server/Client instance you're using. If you're using Unity, FixedUpdate is a good place to do this\n- when retrieving values from messages, ***ORDER MATTERS!*** If you added a `short` followed by a `float` when creating/sending the message, you must call `message.GetShort` and `message.GetFloat` _in that same order_ when handling the message, otherwise you won't get the same values out that you put in\n- message handler methods need to be `static`\n\n## Low-Level Transports\n- [UDP Transport](RiptideNetworking/RiptideNetworking/Transports/Udp) (built-in)\n- [Steam Transport](https://github.com/tom-weiland/RiptideSteamTransport) (in development)\n\n## Donate\nRiptide is 100% free to use, but if you'd like to financially support its development as well as the development of its various transports, you can do so via [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/tom-weiland) or on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/tomweiland).\n\n## License\nDistributed under the MIT license.

  "readme_contents": "Games for the AttinyArcade (or hardware inspired by this system)\n================================================================\n\nBy Andy Jackson - Twitter: @andyhighnumber\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe games in this folder can mostly be played either on the AttinyArcade, or similar hardware (if the hardware is different, there will be a circuit diagram in the same folder as the game).\n\nInfo on programming the Attiny85 chip can be found online, here's an example: https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/arjun/programming-attiny85-with-arduino-uno-afb829 - don't forget to burn the bootloader (it's a menu option under 'Tools' on the Arduino IDE) the first time you flash the chip and if you need to change between 8Mhz and 16Mhz clocks (all my games are 8Mhz, except Pacman which is 16Mhz).\n\nSee www.webboggles.com for details of the AttinyArcade hardware.\n\nThese games are based on the Attiny85 device running at 8Mhz on its internal clock, or 16Mhz for pac-man (don't forget to burn the bootloader when you first flash a new chip- the option to do this is in the \"Tools\" menu on the Arduino IDE).\n\nIn this folder:\n\nFor the standard Attiny Arcade Hardware, or enhanced functionality on custom hardware\n=====================================================================================\n- Pacman_Attiny_Arcade: PacMan clone for the original Attiny. This is the best of the lot in my opinion. Unlike the other games here, this needs to be flashed with a 16Mhz internal clock bootloader (all the others are 8MHz). Send me a message via twitter if this presents any problems.\n- SpaceAttackAttiny: Space Invaders clone for the original Attiny (also allows for modified version of hardware with fire button - see circuit diagram in folder)\n- Frogger_Attiny_Arcade: Frogger clone for the original Attiny (also allows modified version of hardware with jump button - same hardware config as SpaceAttack above - see schematic in folder)\n- MorseAttinyArcade: A morse code decoder (for practicing morse, if you so wish), which displays inputted code via a 5-line scrolling display. When combined with a PLL (or similar) tone detection circuit, this could easily decode off-air morse.\n\nFor the standard Attiny Arcade Hardware\n=======================================\n- WrenRollercoasterAttinyArcade: Inspired by the TinyWings iOS game - fly a wren along a landscape as far as you can! \n- Attiny Tetris: A Tetris clone, evolved from a game for the Arduino by Anthony Russell (https://github.com/AJRussell/Tiny-Tetris)\n- UFO_Stacker_Attiny: Two games in one sketch - UFO (from www.webboggles.com) and Stacker (from me).\n- UFO_Breakout_Arduino: Again - two games in one sketch, both from www.webboggles.com, UFO and Breakout\n- BatBonanzaAttinyArcade: A version of Pong for the standard AttinyHardware - not as playable because you really need analog control for this type of game - see below\n\nFor the MAKERbuino (https://www.makerbuino.com/)\n=======================================\n- PAK-MAN_MAKERbuino: Port of the PAC-MAN AttinyArcade game to the MAKERBUINO / GAMEBUINO platform \n- FROGGER_MAKERbuino: Port of the Frogger AttinyArcade game to the MAKERBUINO / GAMEBUINO platform \n\nFor custom hardware - see circuit schematics in the folders with the sketches\n=============================================================================\n- BatBonanzaAnalog: Pong clone based on custom hardware with analog controls (will work on the same hardware as Space Attack Anlog Version).\n- Space_Attack_Analog: Space Invaders clone (sort of) based on custom hardware with analog control (will work on the same hardware as Bat Bonanza Anlog Version).\n- BatBonanzaAnalogSinglePot: Pong clone based on custom hardware with single-pot analog control (will work on the same hardware as Space Attack Anlog Version).\n- Tetris_Multi_Button: A Tetris cline, as above but designed for multi-button pad (see circuit schematic in folder for details of the hardware)\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Unium\n> A library for game automation.\n\nUnium is an library for [unity](https://unity.com/) that facilities automation. It exposes an HTTP API that can be used for tools or testing.\n\nThere are two parts:\n\n* A web server that is embedded into the game\n* A query language sits on top that lets you search and manipulate the scene graph\n\nThis provides a flexible interface so you can remotely control and inspect your game as it runs. If necessary, you can add your own endpoints to the underlying web server to do custom operations.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### The Tutorial\n\nFor the tutorial\n\n* Clone the [unium repository](https://github.com/gwaredd/unium/)\n* Open the project in Unity\n* Open the Tutorial scene in the editor\n* Hit play\n\nYour default browser should open automatically.\n\nThe tutorial is best experienced with the editor and browser side-by-side. \n\nDocumentation can be found in [unium.pdf](https://github.com/gwaredd/unium/blob/master/Assets/Unium/unium.pdf). \n\nSee also the [FAQ](https://github.com/gwaredd/unium/wiki/FAQ)\n\n### For Your Project\n\nThere are several ways of installing the unium library in your project.\n\nThe preferred approach\n\n* Use the unity package manager (see below)\n\nAlternatively you can\n\n* Copy the `Assets/Unium` folder directly into your project\n* Download it from the [asset store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/unium-automated-test-tools-95998)\n* Or, install one of the [release packages](https://github.com/gwaredd/unium/releases)\n\n**NB:** Remember to enable the `development build` flag if you are making builds (unium is disabled for release by default).\n\n### Package Manager\n\nAs of `v1.0.4` you can use the unity packaging to add unium directly.\n\nYou can now [import unium as a git package using UPM](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-git.html). With Unity 2020.1 or later, you can point to the github repository in your `Packages/manifest.json` dependencies. You can optionally pin to a specific version of unium by adding a revision or tag to this url as per the above documentation.\n\n```\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"com.gwaredd.unium\": \"https://github.com/gwaredd/unium.git?path=/Assets/Unium\",\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor earlier versions of Unity that do not support sub folders in git dependencies, the `upm` branch of the repository contains just the library setup for use with the [package manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.package-manager-ui@1.8/manual/index.html). Note that this version might not contain all latest fixes and improvements.\n\n## Notes\n\n### Writing Tests\n\nThe Unium API facilitates automated tests but is not a testing framework. Below are a number of popular frameworks that have been used with Unium.\n\n* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) - JavaScript\n* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - JavaScript\n* [PyTest](https://pytest.org) - Python\n* [RSpec](https://rspec.info/) - Ruby\n* [SpecFlow](https://specflow.org/) - C#\n* [JUnit](https://junit.org/) - Java\n\nExamples can be found in the [Examples](https://github.com/gwaredd/unium/tree/master/Examples) folder.\n\n### Compatibility\n\n* Compatible with Unity 2017.4.30 and up\n* The aim to is to keep it compatible with the lowest LTS version officially supported by Unity\n\n\n\n### Tutorial Video\n\n[![Unium Tutorial Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/7mTaPr2oaG4/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mTaPr2oaG4 \"Unium Tutorial Video\")\n\n### Demonstration of Unium and Appium working together\n\n[![Unium with Appium](http://img.youtube.com/vi/UbPk2VljW78/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/UbPk2VljW78 \"Unium with Appium\")\n\n"

You can reate new folders in userdata/studio/pose and place the pose data inside them and those folders will show up in your list of poses in Studio. It also saves poses as .png files instead of .dat so you see can see what the content of the pose is. The list of poses is ordered by filename and the pose name is added to the file name so the list will be ordered alphabetically. It also saves skirt FK and facial expressions, though these can be disabled in plugin settings if you prefer.\n\nPorted from Essu's NEOpose List Folders plugin for Honey Select.\n\n#### ListOverride\n\n- [KK_ListOverride]\n- [KKS_ListOverride]\n\nAllows you to override vanilla list files. Comes with some overrides that enable half off state for some vanilla pantyhose.\n\nOverriding list files can allow you to do things like enable bras with some shirts which don't normally allow it, or skirts with some tops, etc. Any part of of the list can be changed except for ID.\n\n#### HairAccessoryCustomizer\n\n- [EC_HairAccessoryCustomizer]\n- [KK_HairAccessoryCustomizer]\n- [KKS_HairAccessoryCustomizer]\n\nAdds configuration options for hair accessories to the character maker. Hair accessories can be set to match color with the hair, enable hair gloss, modify outline color, and has a separate color picker for the hair tie part. Hairs that support a length slider can also have their length adjusted, just like vanilla front hairs. Saves and loads to cards and coordinates.\n\n**Note for modders**: These options will only show up for hair accessories that are properly configured. For accessories to work the accessory must have a\t\t`ChaCustomHairComponent` MonoBehavior in addition to the `ChaAccessoryComponent` MonoBehavior. Hair accessory color will display if the ChaCustomHairComponent rendAccessory array has meshes configured. The length slider will appear if the `ChaCustomHairComponent.trfLength` array has bones configured. Hair color will only match to meshes configured in the `ChaCustomHairComponent.rendHair` array. Also check out [this guide](https://github.com/IllusionMods/KK_Plugins/wiki/Hair-Accessory-Guide) for how to create hair accessories.\n\n<details><summary>Change Log</summary>\nv1.1 Fixed a bug with changing coordinates outside of Studio not applying color matching.

Much like [Marco's clothing overlays](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/Koikatu-Overlay-Mods) you can replace the texture of an item, however with MaterialEditor you can edit much more than clothes. Edit clothes, accessories, hair, and even Studio items.\n\nFeatures:\n* Export UV maps of a mesh to help with drawing textures\n* Replace nearly any texture with custom textures\n* Change properties of materials to control things like shininess or outline thickness\n* Change properties of the mesh to affect whether it casts shadows or disable a mesh completely\n* Change the shader of a material\n* All changes save and load with the card or Studio scene\n* Duplicate textures are saved to the card once. 100 accessories with the same texture have the same file size as one accessory with a texture\n\nAccess the Material Editor by pressing the \"Open Material Editor\" button on clothes, hair, or accessories in the character maker.

  "readme_contents": "# Dolphin - A GameCube and Wii Emulator\n\n[Homepage](https://dolphin-emu.org/) | [Project Site](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin) | [Buildbot](https://dolphin.ci) | [Forums](https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/) | [Wiki](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/) | [Issue Tracker](https://bugs.dolphin-emu.org/projects/emulator/issues) | [Coding Style](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/blob/master/Contributing.md) | [Transifex Page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/dolphin-emu/)\n\nDolphin is an emulator for running GameCube and Wii games on Windows,\nLinux, macOS, and recent Android devices. It's licensed under the terms\nof the GNU General Public License, version 2 or later (GPLv2+).\n\nPlease read the [FAQ](https://dolphin-emu.org/docs/faq/) before using Dolphin.\n\n## System Requirements\n\n### Desktop\n\n* OS\n    * Windows (10 or higher).\n    * Linux.\n    * macOS (10.14 Mojave or higher).\n    * Unix-like systems other than Linux are not officially supported but might work.\n* Processor\n    * A CPU with SSE2 support.\n    * A modern CPU (3 GHz and Dual Core, not older than 2008) is highly recommended.\n* Graphics\n    * A reasonably modern graphics card (Direct3D 11.1 / OpenGL 3.3).\n    * A graphics card that supports Direct3D 11.1 / OpenGL 4.4 is recommended.\n\n### Android\n\n* OS\n    * Android (5.0 Lollipop or higher).\n* Processor\n    * A processor with support for 64-bit applications (either ARMv8 or x86-64).\n* Graphics\n    * A graphics processor that supports OpenGL ES 3.0 or higher. Performance varies heavily with [driver quality](https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2013/09/26/dolphin-emulator-and-opengl-drivers-hall-fameshame/).\n    * A graphics processor that supports standard desktop OpenGL features is recommended for best performance.\n\nDolphin can only be installed on devices that satisfy the above requirements. Attempting to install on an unsupported device will fail and display an error message.\n\n## Building for Windows\n\nUse the solution file `Source/dolphin-emu.sln` to build Dolphin on Windows.\nVisual Studio 2022 17.2.3 or later is a hard requirement. Other compilers might be\nable to build Dolphin on Windows but have not been tested and are not\nrecommended to be used. Git and Windows 11 SDK must be installed when building.\n\nMake sure to pull submodules before building:\n```sh\ngit submodule update --init\n```\n\nThe \"Release\" solution configuration includes performance optimizations for the best user experience but complicates debugging Dolphin.\nThe \"Debug\" solution configuration is significantly slower, more verbose and less permissive but makes debugging Dolphin easier.\n\nAn installer can be created by using the `Installer.nsi` script in the\nInstaller directory. This will require the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System\n(NSIS) to be installed. Creating an installer is not necessary to run Dolphin\nsince the Binary directory contains a working Dolphin distribution.\n\n## Building for Linux and macOS\n\nDolphin requires [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for systems other than Windows. Many libraries are\nbundled with Dolphin and used if they're not installed on your system. CMake\nwill inform you if a bundled library is used or if you need to install any\nmissing packages yourself.\n\nMake sure to pull submodules before building:\n```sh\ngit submodule update --init\n```\n\n### macOS Build Steps:\n\nA binary supporting a single architecture can be built using the following steps: \n\n1. `mkdir build`\n2. `cd build`\n3. `cmake ..`\n4. `make`\n\nAn application bundle will be created in `./Binaries`.\n\nA script is also provided to build universal binaries supporting both x64 and ARM in the same\napplication bundle using the following steps:\n\n1. `mkdir build`\n2. `cd build`\n3. `python ../BuildMacOSUniversalBinary.py`\n4. Universal binaries will be available in the `universal` folder\n\nDoing this is more complex as it requires installation of library dependencies for both x64 and ARM (or universal library\nequivalents) and may require specifying additional arguments to point to relevant library locations. \nExecute BuildMacOSUniversalBinary.py --help for more details.  \n\n### Linux Global Build Steps:\n\nTo install to your system.\n\n1. `mkdir build`\n2. `cd build`\n3. `cmake ..`\n4. `make`\n5. `sudo make install`\n\n### Linux Local Build Steps:\n\nUseful for development as root access is not required.\n\n1. `mkdir Build`\n2. `cd Build`\n3. `cmake .. -DLINUX_LOCAL_DEV=true`\n4. `make`\n5. `ln -s ../../Data/Sys Binaries/`\n\n### Linux Portable Build Steps:\n\nCan be stored on external storage and used on different Linux systems.\nOr useful for having multiple distinct Dolphin setups for testing/development/TAS.\n\n1. `mkdir Build`\n2. `cd Build`\n3. `cmake .. -DLINUX_LOCAL_DEV=true`\n4. `make`\n5. `cp -r ../Data/Sys/ Binaries/`\n6. `touch Binaries/portable.txt`\n\n## Building for Android\n\nThese instructions assume familiarity with Android development. If you do not have an\nAndroid dev environment set up, see [AndroidSetup.md](AndroidSetup.md).\n\nMake sure to pull submodules before building:\n```sh\ngit submodule update --init\n```\n\nIf using Android Studio, import the Gradle project located in `./Source/Android`.\n\nAndroid apps are compiled using a build system called Gradle. Dolphin's native component,\nhowever, is compiled using CMake. The Gradle script will attempt to run a CMake build\nautomatically while building the Java code.\n\n## Uninstalling\n\nWhen Dolphin has been installed with the NSIS installer, you can uninstall\nDolphin like any other Windows application.\n\nLinux users can run `cat install_manifest.txt | xargs -d '\\n' rm` as root from the build directory\nto uninstall Dolphin from their system.\n\nmacOS users can simply delete Dolphin.app to uninstall it.\n\nAdditionally, you'll want to remove the global user directory (see below to\nsee where it's stored) if you don't plan to reinstall Dolphin.\n\n## Command Line Usage\n\n`Usage: Dolphin [-h] [-d] [-l] [-e <str>] [-b] [-v <str>] [-a <str>]`\n\n* -h, --help Show this help message\n* -d, --debugger Show the debugger pane and additional View menu options\n* -l, --logger Open the logger\n* -e, --exec=<str> Load the specified file (DOL,ELF,WAD,GCM,ISO)\n* -b, --batch Exit Dolphin with emulator\n* -v, --video_backend=<str> Specify a video backend\n* -a, --audio_emulation=<str> Low level (LLE) or high level (HLE) audio\n\nAvailable DSP emulation engines are HLE (High Level Emulation) and\nLLE (Low Level Emulation). HLE is faster but less accurate whereas\nLLE is slower but close to perfect. Note that LLE has two submodes (Interpreter and Recompiler)\nbut they cannot be selected from the command line.\n\nAvailable video backends are \"D3D\" and \"D3D12\" (they are only available on Windows), \"OGL\", and \"Vulkan\".\nThere's also \"Null\", which will not render anything, and\n\"Software Renderer\", which uses the CPU for rendering and\nis intended for debugging purposes only.\n\n## Sys Files\n\n* `wiitdb.txt`: Wii title database from [GameTDB](https://www.gametdb.com/)\n* `totaldb.dsy`: Database of symbols (for devs only)\n* `GC/font_western.bin`: font dumps\n* `GC/font_japanese.bin`: font dumps\n* `GC/dsp_coef.bin`: DSP dumps\n* `GC/dsp_rom.bin`: DSP dumps\n* `Wii/clientca.pem`: Wii network certificate\n* `Wii/clientcakey.pem`: Wii network certificate key\n* `Wii/rootca.pem`: Wii network certificate issuer / CA\n\nThe DSP dumps included with Dolphin have been written from scratch and do not\ncontain any copyrighted material. They should work for most purposes, however\nsome games implement copy protection by checksumming the dumps. You will need\nto dump the DSP files from a console and replace the default dumps if you want\nto fix those issues.\n\nWii network certificates must be extracted from a Wii IOS. A guide for that can be found [here](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Wii_Network_Guide).\n\n## Folder Structure\n\nThese folders are installed read-only and should not be changed:\n\n* `GameSettings`: per-game default settings database\n* `GC`: DSP and font dumps\n* `Shaders`: post-processing shaders\n* `Themes`: icon themes for GUI\n* `Resources`: icons that are theme-agnostic\n* `Wii`: default Wii NAND contents\n\n## Packaging and udev\n\nThe Data folder contains a udev rule file for the official GameCube controller\nadapter and the Mayflash DolphinBar. Package maintainers can use that file in their packages for Dolphin.\nUsers compiling Dolphin on Linux can also just copy the file to their udev\nrules folder.\n\n## User Folder Structure\n\nA number of user writeable directories are created for caching purposes or for\nallowing the user to edit their contents. On macOS and Linux these folders are\nstored in `~/Library/Application Support/Dolphin/` and `~/.dolphin-emu`\nrespectively, but can be overwritten by setting the environment variable\n`DOLPHIN_EMU_USERPATH`. On Windows the user directory is stored in the `My Documents`\nfolder by default, but there are various way to override this behavior:\n\n* Creating a file called `portable.txt` next to the Dolphin executable will\n  store the user directory in a local directory called \"User\" next to the\n  Dolphin executable.\n* If the registry string value `LocalUserConfig` exists in\n  `HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Dolphin Emulator` and has the value **1**,\n  Dolphin will always start in portable mode.\n* If the registry string value `UserConfigPath` exists in\n  `HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Dolphin Emulator`, the user folders will be\n  stored in the directory given by that string. The other two methods will be\n  prioritized over this setting.\n\nList of user folders:\n\n* `Cache`: used to cache the ISO list\n* `Config`: configuration files\n* `Dump`: anything dumped from Dolphin\n* `GameConfig`: additional settings to be applied per-game\n* `GC`: memory cards and system BIOS\n* `Load`: custom textures\n* `Logs`: logs, if enabled\n* `ScreenShots`: screenshots taken via Dolphin\n* `StateSaves`: save states\n* `Wii`: Wii NAND contents\n\n## Custom Textures\n\nCustom textures have to be placed in the user directory under\n`Load/Textures/[GameID]/`. You can find the Game ID by right-clicking a game\nin the ISO list and selecting \"ISO Properties\".\n"

In \nsuch games, the agents are trained to communicate with each other and jointly solve a task. Often, the way they communicate is not explicitly determined, allowing agents to come up with their own 'language' in order to solve the task.\nSuch setup opens a plethora of possibilities in studying emergent language and the impact of the nature of task being solved, the agents' models, etc. This subject is a vibrant area of research often considered as a prerequisite for general AI. The purpose of EGG is to offer researchers an easy and fast entry point into this research area.\n\nEGG is based on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and provides: (a) simple, yet powerful components for implementing \ncommunication between agents, (b) a diverse set of pre-implemented games, (c) an interface to analyse the emergent \ncommunication protocols.\n\nKey features:\n * Primitives for implementing a single-symbol or variable-length, discrete or continuous communication (with vanilla FFNs, RNNs, GRUs, LSTMs or Transformers);\n * Support for a single pair as well as a population of interacting agents;\n * Training with optimization of the communication channel with REINFORCE or Gumbel-Softmax relaxation via a common interface;\n * Simplified configuration of the general components, such as checkpointing, optimization, tensorboard support, etc;\n * Provides a simple CUDA-aware command-line tool for grid-search over parameters of the games.\n\nTo fully leverage EGG one would need at least [a high-level familiarity](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html)\nwith PyTorch. However, to get a taste of communication games without writing any code, you could try [a dataset-based game](/egg/zoo/external_game), which allow you to experiment with different signaling games by simply editing input files. \n\n## List of implemented games\n\n<details><summary>List of example and tutorial games</summary><p>\n \n * [`MNIST autoencoder tutorial`](/tutorials/EGG%20walkthrough%20with%20a%20MNIST%20autoencoder.ipynb): A Jupyter tutorial that implements a MNIST discrete auto-encoder step-by-step, covering the basic concepts of EGG. The tutorial starts with pre-training a \"vision\" module and builds single- and multiple symbol auto-encoder communication games with channel optimization done by Reinforce and Gumbel-Softmax relaxation ([notebook](/tutorials/EGG%20walkthrough%20with%20a%20MNIST%20autoencoder.ipynb) / [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/EGG/blob/main/tutorials/EGG%20walkthrough%20with%20a%20MNIST%20autoencoder.ipynb)).\n \n* [`egg/zoo/basic_games`](/egg/zoo/basic_games): Simple implementations of reconstruction and discrimination games, taking their inputs from text files, and with thoroughly annotated code. These might be a good starting point to learn to play with EGG.\n \n * [`egg/zoo/signal_game`](/egg/zoo/signal_game): Modern version of a Lewis' signaling game. In this game, Sender is presented with a target image and with one or more distractor images. Then all images are shuffled and Receiver has to point to the target image based on a message from Sender. This implementation is based on Diane Bouchacourt's code.\n \n * [`egg/zoo/simple_autoenc`](/egg/zoo/simple_autoenc): Discrete auto-encoder Sender/Receiver game that auto-encodes one-hot vectors using variable-length messages.\n * [`egg/zoo/mnist_autoenc`](/egg/zoo/mnist_autoenc): Discrete MNIST auto-encoder game. In this Sender/Receiver game, Sender looks onto a MNIST image and sends a single symbol to Receiver, who tries to recover the image.\n  * [`egg/zoo/mnist_vae`](/egg/zoo/mnist_vae): Continuous-message VAE cast as an auto-encoder game. In this Sender/Receiver (Encoder/Decoder) game, Sender looks onto a MNIST image and sends a multi-dimensional vector to Receiver, who tries to recover the image.\n * [`egg/zoo/summation`](/egg/zoo/summation): Sender and Receiver are jointly trained to recognize the `a^nb^n` grammar: Sender reads an input sequence and Receiver answers if the sequence belongs to the grammar. Which agent actually counts, Sender or Receiver? Does Sender make the decision and send it to Receiver? Or does Sender encode the incoming sequence in the message and it is Receiver that make the decision? Or something in-between?\n * [`egg/zoo/external_game`](/egg/zoo/external_game): A signaling game that takes inputs and ground-truth outputs from CSV files. \n</p></details>\n\n <details><summary>Games used in published work</summary><p>\n \n  * [`egg/zoo/channel`](/egg/zoo/channel): _Anti-efficient encoding in emergent communication._ Rahma Chaabouni, Eugene Kharitonov, Emmanuel Dupoux, Marco Baroni.

Submit an issue if there is something you want to have implemented and included.\n\nMore details on each game's command line parameters are provided in the games' directories.\n\n### An important technical point\n\nEGG supports Reinforce and Gumbel-Softmax optimization of the *communication channel*. Currently, Gumbel-Softmax-based optimization is only supported if the game *loss* is differentiable. The [MNIST autoencoder game tutorial](/tutorials/EGG%20walkthrough%20with%20a%20MNIST%20autoencoder.ipynb) illustrates both Reinforce and Gumbel-Softmax channel optimization when using a differentiable game loss. The [signaling game](/egg/zoo/signal_game) has a non-differentiable game loss, and the communication channel is optimized with Reinforce.\n\n## Installing EGG\n\nGenerally, we assume that you use PyTorch 1.1.0 or newer and Python 3.6 or newer. \n\n 1. (optional) It is a good idea to develop in a new conda environment, e.g. like this:\n    ```\n    conda create --name egg36 python=3.6\n    conda activate egg36\n    ```\n 2. EGG can be installed as a package to be used as a library\n    ```\n    pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/facebookresearch/EGG.git\n    ```\n    or via https\n    ```\n    pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/EGG.git\n    ```\n    Alternatively, EGG can be cloned and installed in editable mode, so that the copy can be changed:\n    ```\n    git clone git@github.com:facebookresearch/EGG.git && cd EGG\n    pip install --editable .\n    ```\n 3.\n    Then, we can run a game, e.g. the MNIST auto-encoding game:\n    ```bash\n    python -m egg.zoo.mnist_autoenc.train --vocab=10 --n_epochs=50\n    ```\n\n## EGG structure\n\nThe repo is organised as follows:\n```\n- tests # tests for the common components\n- docs # documentation for EGG\n- egg\n-- core # common components: trainer, wrappers, games, utilities, ...\n-- zoo  # pre-implemented games \n-- nest # a tool for hyperparameter grid search\n```\n\n## How-to-Start and Learning more\n* Our EMNLP'19 Demo [paper](https://aclanthology.org/D19-3010/) provides a high-level view of the toolkit and points to further resources.\n* The step-by-step [`MNIST autoencoder tutorial`](/tutorials/EGG%20walkthrough%20with%20a%20MNIST%20autoencoder.ipynb) goes over all essential steps to create a full-featured communication game with variable length messages between the agents. NB: depending on your computational resources, this might take a while to run! [(open in colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/EGG/blob/main/tutorials/EGG%20walkthrough%20with%20a%20MNIST%20autoencoder.ipynb)\n* The simplest starter code is in [`egg/zoo/basic_games`](/egg/zoo/basic_games), providing implementations of basic reconstruction and discrimination games. Input can be provided through text files, and the code is thoroughly commented.\n* Another good starting point to implement a Sender/Receiver game is the MNIST autoencoder\ngame, [MNIST auto-encoder game](/egg/zoo/mnist_autoenc). The game features both Gumbel-Softmax \nand Reinforce-based implementations.\n* A template for a game is provided in [`egg/zoo/template`](/egg/zoo/template).\n* EGG can be used for autoencoder-based experiments or even self-supervised learning. An implementation of SimCLR introduce in Chen et al. 2020 can be found in [`egg/zoo/simclr`](/egg/zoo/simclr).\n* EGG provides some utility boilerplate around commonly used command line parameters. Documentation about using it can be found\n[here](docs/CL.md).\n* A brief how-to for tensorboard is [here](docs/tensorboard.md).\n* To learn more about the provided hyperparameter search tool, read this [doc](docs/nest.md).\n\n## Citation\nIf you find EGG useful in your research, please cite this repository:\n```\n@misc{kharitonov:etal:2021,\n  author = \"Kharitonov, Eugene  and Dess{\\`i}, Roberto and Chaabouni, Rahma  and Bouchacourt, Diane  and Baroni, Marco\",\n  title = \"{EGG}: a toolkit for research on {E}mergence of lan{G}uage in {G}ames\",\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/facebookresearch/EGG}},\n  year = {2021}\n}\n```\n\n## Contributing\nPlease read the contribution [guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n\n## Testing\nRun pytest:\n\n```\npython -m pytest\n```\n\nAll tests should pass.\n\n## Licence\nThe majority of EGG is licensed under MIT, however portions of the project are available under separate license terms: [LARC](egg/zoo/emcom_as_ssl/LARC.py) is licensed under the BSD 3-Clause license.\n\nThe text of the license for EGG can be found [here](LICENSE).\n"

We had plans for v3 yet but development isn't active. So v2 will probably remain the main stable version until further notice.\n\n> We try to publish **minor update releases** for bug fixes, we will review PRs.\n\n#### NPM\n\n```bash\n# Install npm version\n$ npm install whs\n```\n> For `whs@2.2.x` (Three.js r92) use @beta tag\n\n```bash\n# Install npm version\n$ npm install whs@beta\n```\n\n[![NPM Version][npm]][npm-url]\n\n\n### Basic setup\n\nDownload the [minified library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WhitestormJS/whs.js/dev/build/whs.min.js) or link the one from [CDN](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/whitestorm.js)\n\n```html\n<script src=\"js/three.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"js/whs.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nThe code below makes a `WHS.App` instance which handles all your [modules](modules) and components for better work with `WebGL`. This one creates a _scene_, _camera_ and _renderer_ - we add the following modules to the App.\n\n```js\nconst app = new WHS.App([\n  new WHS.ElementModule(), // Apply to DOM.\n  new WHS.SceneModule(), // Create a new THREE.Scene and set it to app.\n\n  new WHS.DefineModule('camera', new WHS.PerspectiveCamera({ // Apply a camera.\n    position: new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 50)\n  })),\n\n  new WHS.RenderingModule({bgColor: 0x162129}), // Apply THREE.WebGLRenderer\n  new WHS.ResizeModule() // Make it resizable.\n]);\n\napp.start(); // Run app.\n```\n\n<a

If you're interested in updating or maintaining Slackwolf, please send me a message! \n\nSlackwolf is a bot for Slack. After inviting the bot to a channel, you can play the timeless game of [Werewolf (also called Mafia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)).\n\n![ProjectImage](http://i.imgur.com/0Kwd8oe.png)\n\n## Roles\nSlackwolf currently supports Seer, Bodyguard, Witch, Lycan, Tanner, Beholder, Villager, Wolfman, and Werewolf. You'll need at least a 6 player game in order to see roles other than Seer/Villager/Werewolf given out.\n\n## How to play\n`/invite` the bot (and some friends) to a channel and type !help\n\n## Installation via Docker\nRun the below command to start a container.\n```\ndocker run -d --name slackwolf --restart always \\\n   -e \"BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-16776859568-RxBtmpeS7isMAQonAEqS1hYLb\" \\\n   -e \"TIMEZONE=America/Los_Angeles\" \\\n   -e \"BOT_NAME=werewolf-moderator\" \\\n   -e \"DEBUG=1\" \\\n   gillisct/slackwolf\n```\n\n## Development via Docker\nIn order to use a docker container for development of this project, first build\nthe container with the following command:\n```\ndocker build -t {namespace}/slackwolf .\n```\nSubstituting `namespace` for a relevant namespace you wish to refer the\ncontainer in, commonly your dockerhub username. Then modify following command\nwith your Slack Credentials and chosen namespace:  \n\n```\ndocker run -it --name slackwolf \\\n-e \"BOT_TOKEN=\" \\\n-e \"TIMEZONE=\" \\\n-e \"BOT_NAME=\" \\\n-e \"DEBUG=1\" \\\n{namespace}/slackwolf \\\n-v \"$(pwd)/src\":/usr/src/slackwolf/src \\\n/bin/bash\n```\nThis will provide you wish a shell inside the container, while still having the\nchanges made within the `src` directory reflected within the container\nenvironment.\n\nTo start the bot within the container type `php bot.php`\n\n## Source Installation\nIf you don't want to use docker, you can install from source.\n\nSlackwolf requires PHP 5.5+ and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).\n\n```\ngit clone http://github.com/chrisgillis/slackwolf\ncd slackwolf\ncomposer install\n```\n\nRename `.env.default` to `.env` and edit it with a valid real-time messaging bot token from Slack. Get a valid token from the \"Custom Integrations\" tab of your Slack \"Configure Apps\" page. Also be sure to put the correct bot name in the `.env` file as well.\n\nTo start the bot type `php bot.php`\n\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe're very accepting of pull requests.

TCC, SDL2, and GLEW are already included!\n2. Open a game folder and run run-windows.bat\n3. For OpenGL games you will need the Windows SDK from Microsoft\n\n### Mac\n1. Install clang by typing \"clang\" in Terminal and clicking the Install button.\n2. Open a game folder and run run-mac.sh\n\n### Linux\n1. Install tcc, SDL2-dev, and GLEW-dev. Eg. for Debian/Ubuntu:\n\n    sudo apt install tcc libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libglew-dev\n\n2. Open a game folder and run run-linux.sh\n\n## Next?\n\nAfter you're done playing an exhilirating demo game, open the .c file in your favorite text editor. You're now looking at the actual code you just ran. So feel free to tinker and run it with your changes. Or use it as a starting point for your own game!\n"
